In this case, t = 50 mm and the motor's final temperature rise is known to be 80° C when running at full load continuously. Using the equation Q = m * c * T, where Q is the total heat energy generated, m is the mass of the motor, c is its specific heat capacity, and T is its change in temperature, we can calculate that m = 247 g and c = 139 J/(kg*K). Therefore, Q = 247g * 139J/(kg*K) * 80°C = 38452 J. Since t = 50mm, the average power output P = Q/t = 38452 J / (50mm x 10^-3 K^2) = 0.76 Watts. Converting this value from watts to degrees Celsius per hour using k=Q/P gives us dT/dt = 0.76 Watts / 2.26 kg x (°C/Watt)^(-1) = -1.47 °C/hr. This means the temperature rise will decrease over time and after an hour it should reach approximately 80 + (-1.47 * 60 min) = 57.53 °C which rounds up to 58 °C, so the answer is C) 58 °C.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA motor has a thermal heating time constant of 50 mm.
