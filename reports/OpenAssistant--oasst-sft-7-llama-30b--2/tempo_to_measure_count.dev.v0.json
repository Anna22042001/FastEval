For example if we assume all notes have duration of one second then at a standard tempo of 100BPM there will be 8 measure because 60*60=3600 seconds so 3600/8 = 450 for each measure meaning the first quarter is worth two measures, the next four eights make three more measures, followed by another two quarter and finally 8 sixteens which also constitute 2 measures leaving 2 measures left over after the last whole note has finished. If however the notes were to be held longer than a second or the BPM increased then less measures would be required to fit into a minute.
