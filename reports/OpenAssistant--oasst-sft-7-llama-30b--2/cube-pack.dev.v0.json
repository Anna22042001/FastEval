Firstly, we need to determine the volume of each cube and the volume of the box. We do so by multiplying the length, width, and height of each object:\n\nVolume of one cube = Length × Width × Height\n= 0.7 m × 0.8 m × 1.0 m\n= 0.56 cubic meters\n\nVolume of the box = Length × Width × Height\n= 0.9 m × 1.7 m × 1.5 m\n= 2.82 cubic meters\nNext, let's find out the total surface area for the cubes and the box. For a cube, its six faces have an equal area, which is calculated as follows:\n\nSurface Area of one cube = 6 faces × Area per face\n= 6 faces × (Length × Width / 2)\n= 6 faces × 0.7 m × 0.8 m / 2\n= 2.44 square meters\n\nNow, let's find the total surface area of the box:\n\nSurface Area of the box = 6 faces × Area per face\n= 6 faces × (Length × Width / 2)\n= 6 faces × 0.9 m × 1.7 m / 2\n= 5.42 square meters\nSince the total volume of the box is larger than the sum of volumes of all the cubes, it's possible to place some cubes into the box.
