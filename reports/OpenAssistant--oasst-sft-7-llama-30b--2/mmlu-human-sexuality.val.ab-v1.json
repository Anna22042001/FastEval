Symptoms may include a thin, clear discharge from the penis or vagina, as well as pain during urination. The treatment for chlamydia typically involves taking antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin. Tetracycline is an older type of antibiotic that is not recommended for treating chlamydia because it can cause side effects like stomach upset and nausea. Penicillin would also not be effective against chlamydia.\n\nGonorrhea is another STI caused by bacteria. It can also lead to symptoms like burning while urinating and a thick yellowish discharge from the genitals. Treatment usually includes taking antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, cefixime, or azithromycin. Again, tetracycline would not be recommended for this either.\n\nIt's important to note that if you suspect you have an STI, it's crucial to see a healthcare provider right away so they can diagnose you correctly and recommend appropriate treatment. They will perform tests like a nucleic acid amplification test or a Gram stain. Don't delay seeking medical attention!", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAxl Tulip has a thin clear discharge coming from his penis and mild discomfort when he urinates.
