In most cases, this issue can be resolved by following these steps:\n1) Wait patiently as sometimes the process may take some time to complete. However, if your card does not come out after waiting for 30 minutes or more, then proceed to step two.\n2) Press any key on the keyboard to see whether the machine responds. This action usually triggers the system to release your card if it has got stuck due to technical issues or software glitches.\n3) If neither of the above solutions work, try pressing the 'Cancel' button which should appear when there is no other option available. This will close all transactions and return the card back to its original state. At this point, please don't attempt to forcefully remove the card from the slot since doing so might cause damage to both your card and the ATM machine itself. Instead, seek help from bank staff members who are trained to handle such situations properly. They will use specialized tools to safely extract the card without causing further problems. Once they retrieve the card successfully, check it thoroughly to ensure that none of its details were damaged during the incident. Finally, withdraw money again using another ATM or visit the nearest branch of your bank to resolve any related issues.

Some common reasons for this include expiration dates or limits on the amount that can be spent using the card.

Additionally, some merchants might not accept disposable cards due to their temporary nature.
