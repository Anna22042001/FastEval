To find out what the value of [H3O+] should be for this solution, we need to use the equation for the equilibrium constant Kc:\n\nKc = [H3O+][RCOO^-]/[R]^2\n\nWhere R is the reactant and product concentrations expressed in molarity units, and RCOO^- represents the conjugate base of the original compound R-OH (where \"R\" stands for any alkyl group or other organic substance attached to the OH group). For example, if the original compound was acetic acid (CH3COOH), then its conjugate base would be CH3COO^-. This same process applies here, since HR is a monoprotic acid.\n\nFrom the information given, we know that [HR] = 0.000025 M, and the dissociation degree is 0.4, meaning only 40% of the acid molecules will dissociate into their corresponding hydrogen ion and conjugate base at room temperature. So, let's assume the total concentration of HR is still 0.000025 M even after it's fully dissociated. Then, the concentration of the hydrogen ion would be 0.000025 * 0.4 = 0.000010.

This can be calculated using the equation: pH = -log(concentration), where concentration is expressed in moles per liter and logarithm base is ten. In this case, the concentration of HR in the given solution is 0.00003M or 3*10^-5 mol/L. Using the above formula, we get: pH = -log(0.00003) = -(-5.7076) = 5.7076, which rounds up to 5.7 for ease of use.
