Initialize an array of size 25 (since the board is 7 cells long) with all zeros\n2. Iterate through each cell on the board starting from the bottom left corner moving towards the top right corner.\n3. For every non-empty space encountered, mark it as either \"X\" or \"O\", depending on whether the current cell belongs to the first player (\"X\") or second player (\"O\").\n4. After completing step 3, iterate through the array again and check for three consecutive \"X's\" horizontally or vertically. If any such combination is found, return \"X\". Similarly, check for three consecutive \"O's\" and return \"O\" if found.\n5. If no winner is found after steps 4 & 5, then return \"Draw\".\n```\nFor example, given this input string `0Y0000X`, we would first initialize our array with all zeroes. Then, iterating through the board, we see that the bottom row contains a single \"Y\" at position `(0,6)`, so we set `array[6] = 'Y'` and move to the next row up. The next row is completely blank, so nothing needs to be done. In the third row there are two \"Y's\" at positions `(1,6)` and `(2,6)`, so we set both `array[5]` and `array[4]` equal to `'Y'`.
