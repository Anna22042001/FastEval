These lone pairs cause repulsion among adjacent electron densities, leading to nonzero bond angles. However, the size of these angles varies depending on factors such as bond strengths and steric effects. For example, NO2- typically exhibits smaller bond angles than NO3- because its central nitrogen atom shares electrons with three other atoms, while NO3- only does so with four other atoms.

An acidic solution has a pH less than 7, and a basic (alkaline) solution has a pH greater than 7. The most common test for determining if a compound is basic or acidic involves adding it to water, as this causes the soluble ionisable groups within the substance to dissociate into positive cations and negative anions. These can then react further with other species present in the mixture, allowing us to determine whether the starting material was basic or acidic.\n\nThe hydrogen ion concentration ([OH^-]) of a strong base solution is much higher than would be predicted by its [H_3O^] alone. This indicates that there are also anions contributing to the pH of the solution. In particular, many strong bases form OH^- ions during the reaction, rather than just H_3O^ ones. For example, ammonia forms OH^- ions instead of H_3O^:\nNH_3 + H_2O → NH_4OH^- + H_3O^+\nThis results in a stronger alkalinity overall.
