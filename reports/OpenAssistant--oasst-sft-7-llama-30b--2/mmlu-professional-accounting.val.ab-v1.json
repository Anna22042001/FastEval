In this case, the subscription price for K-T-Lew Corporation's common stock is $54 per share. To encourage shareholders to participate in the rights offering, the company often offers them a certain number of free subscription rights, which they can then exercise to buy more shares at the reduced price.\n\nEach shareholder has four subscription rights that allow him/her to buy one additional share of stock at the subscription price ($54 in this case). The total value of these four subscription rights is therefore equal to the current market price of one share plus the subscription price minus any transaction costs or other fees associated with exercising the rights. This means that if the stock is trading above the subscription price, the value of the subscription rights will be less than the full cost of buying the stock outright.\n\nIn this question, we know that the market price of K-T-Lew Corporation's common stock is $60 per share, so the intrinsic value of the subscription rights must be equal to the difference between the two prices:\n\n$60 - $54 = $6.00\n\nTherefore, the theoretical value of a single subscription right would be $6 / 4 = $1.50. However, since the problem states that the stock is trading \"rights-on\" (meaning the rights have been stripped away), it indicates that investors believe the rights themselves have no value beyond their use as part of the larger bundle of shares and rights that make up the company's capital structure. Therefore, the theoretical value of a single subscription right should be zero.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe market price of K-T-Lew Corporation's common stock is $60 per share, and each share gives its owner one subscription right.
