Therefore, your estimated tax liability would depend on whether you are single or married filing jointly.\n\n    If you are single, your taxable income will be up to $80,400 ($75,000 + $4,900 standard deduction). At a 21% tax rate, your estimated tax liability would be approximately $15,508 (14,383 - 1,157 Taxable Income x 0.21).\n\n    If you are married filing separately, your taxable income will be up to $50,200 ($45,000 + $4,900 standard deduction). At a 21% tax rate, your estimated tax liability would be approximately $8,736 (16,393 - 987 Taxable Income x 0.21).\n\n    If you are married filing jointly, your taxable income will be up to $85,800 ($80,400 + $5,300 standard deduction). At a 21% tax rate, your estimated tax liability would be approximately $13,948 (18,282 - 11,163 Taxable Income x 0.21).\n\nTherefore, based on these calculations, option D ('23,001') is the most accurate answer, assuming all other factors remain constant.

Here are my calculations based on the information provided:\n\nOption C: 6,383\nExplanation: To determine the tax liability, we need to first calculate the taxable income. The taxable income is calculated by subtracting certain deductions from the gross income. In this case, since you're a student living off campus, you have limited deductible expenses such as tuition, housing, food, etc., so your taxable income would be:\n\nGross Income - Deductible Expenses = Taxable Income\n6,383 - 0 = 6,383\nTherefore, your tax liability under Option C would be $3,962 (6,383 x 0.2).\n\nOption D: 8,393\nExplanation: Under Option D, we use the higher tax bracket of the two given options. Since you'll be taxed at the top marginal rate of 13.3%, your taxes under Option D would be:\n\n8,393 x 13.3% = 1,007.91\nTherefore, your total tax liability under Option D would be $1,007.91.\n\nOptions A and B do not make sense because they involve an extra tax amount that's not present in the given scenarios.
