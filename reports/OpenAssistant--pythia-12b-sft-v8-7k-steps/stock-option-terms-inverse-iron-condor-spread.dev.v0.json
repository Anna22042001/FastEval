It aims to reduce potential losses by buying puts and selling calls to generate protective profits when stock prices decline. In this case, the investor expects stock prices to decrease, so they implement the strategy to limit their downside risk by:\n\n - Selling one $88 put contract (for protection) and purchasing one $1.49 put contract (to lock in gains). This results in a net cost of $0.51 per share. \n\n- Selling one $110 call contract (for protection) and purchasing one $2.77 call contract (to protect against further loss). This results in a net cost of $0.47 per share. \n\n - Selling one $93 call contract (for protection) and purchasing one $2.06 call contract (to limit further loss). This results in a net cost of $0.62 per share. \n\n - The total cost of these transactions is $3.21 ($0.51 + $0.47 + $0.62), which will be paid upon exercise. \nIf the stock price remains unchanged throughout the life of the options, then the profit from these positions would be $4.61 per share ($7.22 before commissions and fees).
