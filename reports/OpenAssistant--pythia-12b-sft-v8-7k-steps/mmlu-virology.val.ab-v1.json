This process involves two main stages: initiation and termination. Initiation occurs at specific sites on the Adenovirus genome (the \"early regions\") where transcription of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) takes place. Transcription produces large amounts of viral mRNA, which are then translated into early protein products. Termination occurs after the last stage of gene expression has been completed, by cutting the DNA strand at specific points using an enzyme called terminase. Then, each viral particle contains only one complete set of instructions for making more viruses.
