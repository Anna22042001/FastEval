Human Security is closely tied to energy security, especially given the significant role fossil fuel plays in modern economies. As such, the actions taken by other nations to secure these energy sources also impact the stability of many oil producing countries.

Stable democracies with open markets facilitate greater cooperation between nations regarding energy development and trade, leading to increased efficiency and lower costs than previous practices involving less secure nation-states.
