This question tests your knowledge of basic statistics concepts related to constructing confidence intervals. \n\nHere's how you can solve it: \n- First, understand what a confidence interval is. It represents the range of values that one could reasonably expect the true population value to fall within if we repeat the experiment many times and calculate the intervalscore in each case. \n- Next, consider why there may be differences between the two types of intervals in terms of their width. Confidence intervals are typically calculated using sample standard errors (SEs), which are estimates of the sampling error in the data. These SEs are used as weights when calculating the interval score. When the sample size is small, the SEs tend to be smaller, resulting in wider confidence intervals. However, this does NOT mean that the actual confidence intervals will always be wider, only that the proportion of cases where the true parameter falls inside the interval increases as the sample size grows. Thus, while wider intervals indicate less certainty about the true value, they also provide more evidence that it is close to the upper/lower bound of the interval.\n- To determine which type of confidence interval to use depends on the desired level of significance (the probability of Type I error - falsely rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true). In general, a higher level of significance means that fewer studies will find significant results just by chance alone. For example, a 5% level would require more extreme outcomes before rejecting the null hypothesis (e.g., 95% CI excludes 0). If you're more concerned with ensuring accurate inference from your study, then a lower level like 90% might be better.
