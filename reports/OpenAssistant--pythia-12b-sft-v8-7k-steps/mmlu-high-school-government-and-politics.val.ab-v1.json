Congress’s power to determine national policy increases during times of war. This is because when the country is in a state of declared or undeclared war, the federal government gains additional powers from the Constitution that are not available at other times. These include the power to raise armies and navies, to make rules for the governance and regulation of land and naval forces, and to call out the militia to execute laws directed by the President. In addition, the Constitution grants Congress the authority “to declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.” (Article I, Section 8, Clause 11) Therefore, as long as there is a war, Congress has significant power over national security matters. \n\nDuring peacetime, however, most political scientists believe that Congress has less power than it did before the Civil War era. For example, James Madison argued in Federalist Paper No. 47 that Congress should have only certain diplomatic functions related to negotiating treaties and sending Ambassadors abroad. Other duties like regulating commerce and raising revenue were left to the executive branch as part of the system of checks and balances intended by the founders. Nevertheless, Congress does retain some residual powers even during non-war periods such as those related to impeachment proceedings against the President, responding to natural disasters and other emergencies, and making appropriations for specific programs run by independent agencies. The level of congressional involvement also varies depending on which party is in control. When one party holds both houses of Congress and the White House, as was often the case between 1946 and the present day, the legislative branch tends to take more initiative in passing new legislation while the executive branch plays a larger role in implementing these bills.
