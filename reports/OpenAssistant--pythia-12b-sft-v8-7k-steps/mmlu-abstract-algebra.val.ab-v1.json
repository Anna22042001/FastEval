Both of these have a field of quotients (the field of rational numbers), so we know that 1. applies. But if 3 is in S and T, then neither 0 nor 1 are in their respective fields of quotients, which means 2. doesn't apply. So we get C => (True,False). \n\nIn general however, there isn't really a relationship between whether a field exists and whether it can be constructed using only division.
