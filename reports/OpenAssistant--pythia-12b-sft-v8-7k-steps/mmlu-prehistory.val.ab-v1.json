The earliest evidence of maize cultivation in North America comes from Mexico where archaeologists have found caches of maize dating back to around 4000 BC. By 3000BC, maize had spread throughout most of central North America as far west as Colorado and Nebraska. It eventually made its way into the Southwestern United States by 1200 AD. The development of corn-based crops like beans, squash, and chili allowed Native Americans to abandon a nomadic lifestyle for settled village life.
