By embracing the idea of multi-task learning, LeCun was able to create a more flexible and adaptable type of AI that could potentially solve many different kinds of problems. In addition to his contributions to multi- task learning, LeCun has also made significant advances in deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
