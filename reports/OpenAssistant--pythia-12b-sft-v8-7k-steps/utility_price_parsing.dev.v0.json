Here's an example output for your given input:\n\n{\n  \"supply_cost_per_kwh\": \"8.35\",\n  \"delivery_cost_per_kwh\": \"4.96\"\n}\n\n\nThe supply charge is calculated by dividing the total electric supply charges by the number of kilowatt hours provided. In this case, it would be:\nTotal Electric Supply Charges / 121 kWh = 0.26975/121 kW h = $0.20962 per kWh\n\n\nSo the cost per kWh of electricity supply would be $0.20962. The delivery charge is similarly computed by dividing the total electric delivery charges by the number of kilowatt hours used. In this case, it would be:\nTotal Electric Delivery Charges / 121 kWh = 0.2093 / 121 kW h = $0.1785 per kWh\n\n\nSo the cost per kWh of electricity delivery would be $0.1785.
