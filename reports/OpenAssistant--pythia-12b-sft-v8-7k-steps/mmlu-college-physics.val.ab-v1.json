In contrast, in a constant-pressure process, the total number of particles remains constant while their density changes; in a constant-temperature process, both the number and density of particles remain fixed while the temperature changes. Finally, in an adiabatic process, no work is done on the system by any external agency, only Heat is exchanged between the system and its surroundings. \n\nSince the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and not on its volume or other physical parameters, increasing the internal energy of an ideal gas corresponds to adding heat. Therefore, for an ideal gas, a change in internal energy can be attributed to either a constant-volume or constant-heat process, depending on how the heat is supplied to the gas. \n\nHowever, if we consider real gases instead of ideal ones, then we need to take into account the contribution of the pressure and volume dependent terms in their free energies. Thus, in reality, different types of interactions such as van der Waals forces would also contribute to the thermal behavior of real gases, and hence they may experience some deviations from ideality. \n\nTherefore, regarding real gases, the statement that an ideal gas increases its internal energy upon addition of heat holds true for all four types of thermodynamic processes: constant-volume, constant-pressure, constant-temperature, and adiabatic. But due to the presence of intermolecular forces, these systems deviate somewhat from ideality and this deviation increases with decreasing temperature.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFor which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\nA) Constant volume\nB) Constant pressure\nC) Constant temperature\nD) Adiabatic", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 17:48:06.861222+00:00"}
