Therefore, we must have made some mistake. What went wrong?\n\nThe problem statement says \"tossing\" the die, but we are meant to find the probabilities for a specific outcome of rolling the dice, not for the process of tossing it. This would make sense if we were talking about the probability of rolling a 6 on any given roll of the dice (which would be very small), rather than the probability of getting at least one six on at least 70 rolls of the dice. To fix this issue, we need to change the question so that it matches the appropriate formula.\n\nLet X represent the event that a six comes up at least once during the 360 rolls.

However, without any further context, we cannot determine which of these four options must be true based on the given information. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: f is one-to-one.

If f were not one-to-one, it would not satisfy this property, so option D is ruled out by the given premise. Option B, that g is one-to-one, follows directly from the same reasoning. Therefore, the only remaining option is that g is onto. But since we assumed that g ∘ f is one-to-one, this contradicts the fact that g is not one-to-one.
