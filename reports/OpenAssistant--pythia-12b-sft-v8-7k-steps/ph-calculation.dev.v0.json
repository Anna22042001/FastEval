We have learned earlier that 1 mole of any substance contains 1 mole of each kind of atoms or molecules. That means there should be 2 moles of hydrogen in this compound. One mole of HR corresponds to 0.1000M solutions because 1 mole =1/12th of the full molar mass of HR. \nSo we know that 0.1000=0.09(molar mass) * 100 so 0.1000=90g*mol-1 and 9g/mol=0.1000 mol-1. It follows that the molecule consists of 90 g of H and 10 g of C which altogether contain all the 12 hydrogens required for balancing the charge.
