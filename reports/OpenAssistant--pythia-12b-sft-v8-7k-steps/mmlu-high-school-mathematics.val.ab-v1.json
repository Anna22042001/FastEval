If neither A nor C is lying, then both must be telling the truth (T). Therefore, at least one of them must have told the truth about something they didn't actually know (L), so we don't count this as an honest response. This means there are 4 ways to get a false negative result: \n- If A was lying but everyone else believed him, T would be true but nobody believes A, giving 2 negatives from 1 response for a total of 0. \n- If C was lying but everyone else believed her, T would be true but nobody believes C, giving 2 more false negatives for a total of 0. \nSo there are only 4 - 0 = 4 remaining ways for at least one person to have lied despite being identified correctly. We need to calculate how many responses were required for this to occur, which we do using Bayes' theorem: \n P(L|not L) * N + P(L|L) * (N-1)  = 1 where L stands for \"lied\" and not L stands for \"told the truth\". \nFor every case where C lied and everyone thought she was telling the truth, another case of C telling the truth while everyone thinks he is lying needs to occur (since T could still be true). So we double the number of cases when C was honest. That gives us: \n2*P(L|not L) * N + 2*(N-1)*P(L|L)  = N+N-1 = 2N-1   for those honesty tests where C is being counted twice.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIn a group of 11 people, T of them always tell the truth, and L always lie.
