Let's assume that the stock price stays between $250 (100 * $240) and $300 (100 * $270). We can use these limits as a guide since there isn't enough information provided about the contract expirations to make more precise calculations.\n\nFor selling the puts, the maximum loss would occur if the stock price were exactly equal to the strike price ($250), which gives us a loss of $2 per share ($240 - 240 = 0). To find the maximum possible loss when the stock price is below $250 but above $240, we subtract $1 from the previous loss amount, giving us a maximum loss of $0.02 per share (-$1 * 2 + $0 = -0.02). Therefore, the total maximum loss would be -0.02 * 100 = -20 dollars.\n\nFor buying the calls, the maximum gain would occur if the stock price were exactly equal to the lower strike price ($220), which gives us a profit of $50 per share ($220 - 220 = 0). To find the maximum possible gain when the stock price is above $280 but below $300, we add $10 to the previous gain amount, giving us a maximum gain of $50 (10 + 50 = 60). Therefore, the total maximum gain would be 60 * 100 = 6000 dollars.\n\nThe difference between these amounts gives us our final answer of -20 - 6000 = -5900 dollars.
