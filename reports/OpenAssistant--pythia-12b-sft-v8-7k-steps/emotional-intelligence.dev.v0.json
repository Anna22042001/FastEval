By taking responsibility for his own work, Alan can demonstrate empathy and respect for Trudy while also ensuring that she receives adequate support. Additionally, working together towards a solution can potentially resolve any underlying issues and improve communication between them.\n\n- Apologize to Trudy - An apology can show Trudy that Alan takes her concerns seriously and empathizes with her feelings. It can also open up the possibility for reconciliation and future cooperation. However, it may not be as effective in resolving immediate tensions, especially if the root cause remains unaddressed.\n\n- Stop helping Trudy and don't help her again - This option could lead to further tension and misunderstandings, especially if Trudy perceives Alan as being dismissive of her input. By stopping all future interactions, including necessary professional relationships, this decision could ultimately harm their working relationship and potentially impact other areas of collaboration.\n\nOverall, based on the given information and considering the potential outcomes, I believe that trying harder to help appropriately would be the most effective response for Alan in this particular scenario.
