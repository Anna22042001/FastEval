Option strategies can be complex, and it's crucial to understand how different factors such as time decay, volatility, and changes in the underlying stock's price will impact your P&L over time. If you need help deciding whether to adjust any existing positions or enter new ones based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, or market outlook, I recommend consulting a financial advisor or experienced trader.

In this case, it is a long put butterfly spread as the trader has sold one put option contract with a lower strike price (put premium) and bought two other put options with higher strike prices (lower put premiums), creating a net credit received from the sale of the first put which offsets part of the cost of purchasing the second two puts.

This strategy can be used by both bullish and bearish investors depending on their market outlook.

In this case, the investor has bought an out-of-the money (OTM) put at a lower strike price ($25), while simultaneously selling another OTM put at a higher strike price ($27).
