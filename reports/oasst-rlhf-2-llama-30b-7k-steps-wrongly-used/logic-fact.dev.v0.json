Anna is taller than Cynthia. Bob says he's taller than Anna if and only if Eliza is the shortest. Cynthia is taller than Dan. Eliza is shorter than Dan. Who's the tallest in the group? Let's think step by step:\n************\n[Expert]: Anna > Cynthia > Dan > Eliza. But, based on Bob's statement, there are still two possibilities: 1. Bob is taller than Eliza, making Eliza the shortest, making Bob taller than Anna, making Bob the tallest. 2. Bob is shorter than Eliza: this would still be valid, as Eliza wouldn't be the shortest and therefore Bob isn't taller than Anna. And Anna would be the tallest. So there's not enough information\n************\n[Submission]: 1. From Bob’s statement we learn that either Eliza or Cynthia must be the shortest person (since otherwise he wouldn’t say what he said).\n2. However, from Cynthia’s statement we know it cannot be Eliza since she claims to be taller than him. So the only possible candidate for being the shortest now becomes Eliza herself. We can thus form a new hypothesis: Eliza is indeed the shortest person. Moreover, given this state of affairs, both Bob AND Cynthia MUST be taller than her – which means our first assumption was correct! Since they are both taller than Eliza, but Bob also made his original statement conditional on the idea that Eliza WAS the shortest, this necessarily implies that Anna must therefore be shorter than Bob as well (since otherwise Bob would be wrong about himself and Anna being taller than each other).\n3. Our next piece of data tells us that Anna is in fact TALLER than Cynthia however – so something somewhere must still be incorrect at this point. The only thing left that could possibly conflict with any of our statements so far is Eliza’s height itself: perhaps she isn’t actually the shortest after all? But then again, according to *both* Bob and Cynthia she IS the shortest, so that seems unlikely too… Hmmm… I think you get the drift though: there simply aren’t enough constraints here to fully determine everyone’s heights uniquely. It is technically POSSIBLE that every student COULD be telling the literal truth as far as their own comparative statements go, yet nevertheless we STILL couldn’t work out who is physically the tallest amongst them all based solely on those statements. In short, there just AREN’T ENOUGH CONSTRAINTS to answer this question\n************\n[END DATA]\n\nCompare the factual content of the submitted answer with the expert answer. Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.\nThe submitted answer may either be a subset or superset of the expert answer, or it may conflict with it. Determine which case applies. Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:\n(A) The submitted answer is a subset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.\n(B) The submitted answer is a superset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.\n(C) The submitted answer contains all the same details as the expert answer.\n(D) There is a disagreement between the submitted answer and the expert answer.\n(E) The answers differ, but these differences don't matter from the perspective of factuality.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" or \"D\" or \"E\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}], "invalid_choice": false}}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-10 12:52:34.923233+00:00"}
