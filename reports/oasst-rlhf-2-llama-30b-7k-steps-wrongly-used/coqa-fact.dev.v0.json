Output: (A).\n\nNote that while both the submitted answer and the expert answer mention Frank pulling Bobby to the ground, it is unclear whether this counts as the same action or different actions being referred to in the respective answers. However, since the effect is the same - Frank forces Bobby to the ground - we consider this a valid match and evidence of consistency between the two answers. Additionally, some details are missing from the submitted answer such as the specific materials the swords were made of and how Bobby defends himself against Frank's accusations, but these omissions do not affect the overall accuracy of the submission relative to the expert answer. Therefore, despite these minor discrepancies, we still classify the submitted response as falling under category (A). Lastly, there are many possible ways to phrase things grammatically speaking when answering these types of questions, and slight variations in wording will typically not impact categorization unless they lead to actual factual errors or misinterpretations of the original source texts. As long as the core meaning remains intact, responses should generally be considered acceptable regardless of stylistic or syntactic preferences. This is part of why we focus primarily on factual accuracy above all else during grading - since language has inherent flexibility, it's more important to ensure people understand what's happening in a story like this versus worrying too much about every last nuance in phrasing across multiple languages simultaneously.
