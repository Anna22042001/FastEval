The esophagus does however run behind the heart, so perhaps you got a little confused there! It's always important to question your understanding of anything you read or hear about anatomy, because it can sometimes be difficult to visualize exactly where things are relative to other structures, especially when they aren't mentioned explicitly. As such, I hope this clears up any confusion you may have had regarding the positioning of these two organs.

So, the pharyngeal mucosa is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), a branch of the cranial nervous system, via the pharyngeal plexus. Hence, A is the correct option. BPQRST is a mnemonic for remembering the branches of the external carotid artery - branches are Posterior Auricular, Maxillary, Occipital, Petrosal, Caroticotympanic, Stylopharyngeus. The internal maxillary artery is an important branch of the IMA (Internal Maxilla Artery), while other branches are smaller and supply the structures in their respective areas. The styloid process receives its blood supply primarily through the ECA (External Carotid Artery). However, some branches arise from the ICA (Internal Carotid Artery) as well. The common facial vein is formed by the union of several small veins and drains into the retromandibular vein or the posterior auricular vein. It usually passes deep to the Digastric muscle but sometimes pierces this muscle anteriorly to reach the submandibular region. So, CACDPM is not a valid mnemonic for memorizing the branches of the External Carotid Artery. Therefore, there cannot be any definitive order among them since they do not represent the actual structure/branches accurately enough.
