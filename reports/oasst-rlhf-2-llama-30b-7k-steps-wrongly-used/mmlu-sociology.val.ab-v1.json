Option A is incorrect because the act did not provide assisted places in public schools; instead, it created a new category of school called direct-grant schools that received government funding but still charged fees. Option C is incorrect since public schooling had existed before the act. Option D is partially correct since the act made provision for free secondary education, but this applied only to students attending state schools and not independent or private schools. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement regarding the provisions of the 1944 Education Act.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe 1944 Education Act provided:\nA) assisted places in public schools for those on low incomes\nB) state elementary education for all\nC) public schooling for those who could afford it\nD) free secondary education for all", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 19:44:35.490457+00:00"}

Biopolitics is defined as the way in which political power is exercised through control over life itself, especially in relation to social bodies (such as nation states or corporations). The term biopolitics emerged from Foucauldian work on the history of society and ideas about discipline, governmentality, and power/knowledge. In his later lectures at Collège de France, published under the title Security, Territory, Population, Foucault introduces the concept of bio-power (pouvoir biologique), where he presents an analysis of the foundational correlation between sovereignty, discipline and biopolitics. In this context, bio-politics describes the direct concern with the population – its size, gender, ethnic balance, spatial distribution, birth and mortality rates, rate of growth and so forth. This new political technology would form the basis for modern liberal governance. Some key concepts within the subject area include race eugenics and demography; state racism and genocide; freedom, rights, equality and discrimination; reproductive technologies and family planning; access to health care, drugs and alcohol; poverty, famine, development aid and humanitarian intervention; violence against women, children and minorities; refugees, statelessness, migration and multiculturalism; crime prevention, policing and prisons; warfare, martial law, occupation, pacification and counterinsurgency; self-determination, secession, nationalism and globalization; neoliberalism and economic competition among nations.
