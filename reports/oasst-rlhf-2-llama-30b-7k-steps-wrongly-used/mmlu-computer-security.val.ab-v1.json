The statement \"An attacker stealing the server's private key\" implies an act of illegitimate access or hacking. Assuming honesty from all parties (client, server, hacker), this scenario would be ruled out as it contradicts the assumption. However, if we consider dishonest behaviour on behalf of the server (while assuming honesty from the other two parties), then this threat could occur. Similarly, if we assume legitimate actions by the hacker and server, but consider the possibility that the server might leak its own secret key (either through incompetence or malice), this threat may still apply. In summary, under the given assumptions, option A remains valid since at least one condition must fail to make either part of the sentence true simultaneously. Option B also holds true, since a rogue CA can create fake certificates for any domain name, including the server's. With the stated assumptions however, such a forgery should remain undiscovered. Therefore only option C applies. Under the stated conditions, an eavesdropper cannot decipher intercepted messages without knowledge of the symmetric encryption key (since a symmetric key encrypts data in both directions). Even though a man-in-the-middle attack remains possible while using TLS (as demonstrated by the FREAK exploit in early 2015), the protocol includes measures specifically designed to prevent them - namely the certificate verification process during the handshake phase which authenticates the communicating party. Thus, if the verification succeeds and no tampering occurs, a MITM attack becomes virtually impossible under the stated conditions. Hence option D remains valid as well.
