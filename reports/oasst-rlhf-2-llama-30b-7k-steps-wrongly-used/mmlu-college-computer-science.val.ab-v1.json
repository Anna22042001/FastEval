The time complexity of finding and removing the 7th smallest element from an array of length n sorted in increasing order (data structure II) is O(n), whereas it is O(log n) for both a min-heap (data structure I) and a balanced binary search tree (data structure III). Therefore, option B) II only is the correct answer. Option C) I only is incorrect because a min-heap has an O(log n) time complexity for this operation; similarly, option D) I and II is incorrect because the time complexity of the operation using a balanced binary search tree is also O(log n). Finally, note that the question asks for the data structure(s) whose time complexity is O(log n), so answers involving multiple data structures should be considered as separate options. Therefore, although the time complexities for each of the three given data structures are not equal, the question does not ask for the data structure(s) having a maximum time complexity among those listed. Instead, the question asks specifically for the data structure(s) for which the time complexity is O(log n) in the worst case. This subtle distinction may have caused some confusion or ambiguity in the question if left unaddressed. However, by clarifying what constitutes the \"correct\" answer according to the question's specific criteria, we can avoid such issues. In summary, this exercise helped reinforce the importance of carefully reading questions and interpreting them correctly when practicing problem solving strategies like working backward from the answer choices.
