For example, if the stock price falls below the strike price minus the premium received ($72 - $0.84) for the short put option, then the max loss would occur. Similarly, if the stock price rises above the strike price plus the premium paid ($77 + $1.88) for the long put option, then the max loss would also occur.

The minimum value for the short position is zero, so the actual maximum loss will never exceed that amount.
