Retributive justice is a theory of punishment that asserts criminals are morally deserving of punishment and criminal activity must be responded to in a way that is proportionate to the seriousness of the act committed. It is based on the idea that people who commit crimes freely choose to do so, and therefore have made themselves liable for punishment. The aim of retributive punishment is not rehabilitation or deterrence but rather paying back what is owed to society by making sure wrongdoers suffer for their deeds. This form of justice is often associated with the biblical notion of “an eye for an eye.” While other forms of punishment such as deterrent or reformative punishments may also involve inflicting pain (in the case of deterrence) or changing one's mindset (in the case of reform), retribution focuses solely on ensuring offenders receive their just deserts. Some argue that punishing offenders simply because they deserve it, regardless of any positive outcome, serves to affirm the moral order and uphold standards of right and wrong; this can serve a societal function independent of deterrence or reformation. Others maintain that punishment under retributive theories need not involve negative consequences at all—for example, confiscating money from a thief might both serve retributive ends and leave him better off than before he stole. Still others argue that the mere intention to punish—even if not followed up with actual punishment—is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of retributive justice.

For example, social media platforms like Twitter have allowed for more open communication between students and educators, allowing for real-time feedback and discussion outside of traditional classroom settings. This increased connectivity may empower students to speak up more confidently and challenge authority figures when necessary, although there are still many limitations and challenges associated with this process.
