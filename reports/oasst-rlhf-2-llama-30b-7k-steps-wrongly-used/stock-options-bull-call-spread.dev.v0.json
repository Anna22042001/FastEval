If it finishes above the higher strike price ($90 in this case) then the potential profit would be limited only by how far beyond that point the stock rises, since if the option is exercised you will end up selling 100 shares of the stock at $90 apiece. Conversely, if the stock price finishes below the lower strike price ($85 in this case) then the most you stand to make would be whatever premium you were paid for selling the call, less any transaction costs associated with buying back the options before their expiration date. In this example, the premium is $2.20 per share. Therefore, the potential gain would be limited to $2.20 per share, less transaction costs as necessary. This is a \"breakeven\" scenario where neither you nor the buyer of the call makes a net profit/loss. However, note that there may still be opportunity cost associated with tying up capital in this trade depending on market conditions; even if the stock doesn't move significantly relative to these strikes, its overall performance could be quite different than expected due to external factors like changes in interest rates, economic indicators, etc., so be sure to account for those sorts of risks when making investment decisions!

Therefore, the break-even stock price for this first option would be $408.95 ($410 - $1.05). Similarly, for the second option, the break-even stock price would be $407.65 ($404 + $2.35).\n\nHowever, if we treat both options together as a spread, then we can determine the range within which the stock must trade for neither option to result in a loss.

This equals $404 - $2.35 = $397.35.
