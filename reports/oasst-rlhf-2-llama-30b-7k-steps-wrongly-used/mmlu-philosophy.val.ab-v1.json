The statement \"hard determinism conflicts with the fact of deliberation and our sense that some actions are up to us\" is a summary of Taylor's view on free will and determinism as presented in the passage. According to Taylor, determinists who hold this position believe that all events, including human decisions and actions, are determined by prior causes, which means there can be no genuine alternatives or choices. This conflict between determinism and our experience of deliberating and making choices is what makes hard determinism difficult for people to accept, according to Taylor. Therefore, the correct answer choice is (A). Option (B), (C), and (D) do not accurately summarize Taylor's argument about why people may have difficulty accepting hard determinism.

While prima facie duties may influence our decisions about what is morally permissible, they do not define goodness itself according to this theory. Similarly, while self-benefit may be a factor in some people's decision making, it does not provide a basis for determining whether an act is objectively good or bad under interest theories of the good.

According to Derek Parfit's views on utilitarianism, we should aim to minimize suffering overall, even if it means causing temporary pain or discomfort to some individuals in order to alleviate more severe suffering for others.

On this point, Williams agrees with Joseph Raz's critique of impartiality as a guiding principle for morality. Therefore, the correct answer is A) neither Parfit nor Taurek. While both philosophers discuss ethical dilemmas surrounding helping others, their ideas diverge on several key issues related to moral obligation, personal relationships, and prioritizing well-being. In general, Parfit emphasizes reducing global suffering while acknowledging difficult tradeoffs, whereas Taurek focuses on individual rights and limiting interference or sacrifices requested of people.

Option (A), (B), and (D) are partially correct but do not fully capture the nuances of Epicurus' philosophy regarding pleasure. As such, the correct answer would be (C).

One measure of good reasoning is that it can withstand scrutiny from those who might disagree. For example, an argument for capital punishment could acknowledge some common criticisms (e.g., it may wrongly execute innocent people), respond respectfully to them (e.g., implementing safeguards such as DNA testing to minimize this risk), and show how these responses outweigh any remaining concerns (such as deterrence). Good arguments often persuade neutral listeners because they anticipate possible objections and address them fairly. This approach is likely to lead to conclusions that most people would accept—at least when they carefully consider the matter. However, not everyone will end up agreeing on everything, since we sometimes have honest differences of opinion after considering all relevant factors.[1] While there needn't be universal agreement for personal views to still be justified, the goal should nonetheless be to arrive at reasonable positions based on evidence and sound logic. Thus, a key element of critical thinking is articulating why you believe something—not only what you believe—and being open to revising your perspectives accordingly.

Singer argues that since it is bad for humans and animals to suffer and die from lack of food, shelter, and medical care, we have a moral obligation to prevent this suffering as much as possible by giving money or time to organizations that help those in need. He believes that we should act in ways that maximize overall happiness rather than acting selfishly. This utilitarian view suggests that the best action is one that produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of beings affected. Therefore, it follows logically that if helping others makes us happy and helps them escape their own misery, then doing so is morally right. In conclusion, the idea that \"we ought to do whatever maximizes happiness\" forms the foundation of Singer's argument for why individuals should give generously to charitable causes.\" - [Source](https://www.academia.edu/39412078/Answer_for_question_4).

This is because the existence of multiple personality disorder suggests that there are different aspects or parts within an individual's consciousness, which can be distinct from one another and may have their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"multiple personality disorder\" has been renamed by psychiatric diagnostic manuals since this question was written. Currently, it is called \"dissociative identity disorder.\" However, the basic idea remains the same: that individuals with this condition experience fragmentation of their consciousness into separate identities or personalities. This does not mean that the mind itself is divisible in some fundamental way, but rather that certain mental processes (such as memory or self-awareness) can be compartmentalized or separated within the individual's psyche under specific conditions. Other answers given in the question are generally incorrect or misleading:\n\n* A) Incorrect. While the exact nature of consciousness and its relation to brain function remain topics of much debate among scientists and philosophers, the notion that the mind is indivisible is largely based on subjective experiences of unity and continuity of our inner lives. The fact that people with multiple personality disorder might display differing patterns of behavior or thought in different states does not necessarily imply that they lack such unity altogether.\n* B) Inaccurate. Mental illnesses are treatable, though treatment outcomes vary depending on factors like severity of symptoms, access to care, patient compliance, etc. It would be wrong to assume that just because someone has MPD/DIID they must always suffer from it unremittingly throughout life.\n* C) Misleading.
