However, please note that this task assumes a perfect accuracy of the input data, which might not always be the case. Therefore, it is important to validate and check the accuracy of the coordinates before using them. It is also worth mentioning that some countries may have overlapping territories or shared borders due to historical or political reasons. In such cases, providing the name of a country based on coordinates alone can sometimes lead to ambiguity or confusion. To avoid this, additional context and information about the area can help determine the appropriate country.\n\nHere is an example code snippet in Python that takes in the coordinates and returns the name of the country:\n```python\ndef get_country(latitude, longitude):\n    # Code to fetch list of countries from latitude and longitude\n    finland = Country(name=\"Finland\", lat=70.97844830785297, lng=178.40202924315406)\n    if finland in countries:\n        return finland.name\n    else:\n        return \"None\"\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Country` class with properties like `name`, `lat`, and `lng`. This allows us to store and manipulate information related to different countries more efficiently. We then create an instance of the `Country` class with the details of Finland and compare it against the list of countries returned by our implementation.

And also the distance between this place and Ottawa(the capital city of Canada) is roughly around 3100KM. This shows how large the size of a country can be. Even though both places belong to the same country , they have very different climates and living conditions. It takes more than one day to travel from one place to another. So when we talk about the size of a country, it should always considered along with its impact on citizens. There could be many such examples across the globe where there would be vast difference within the countries based on the location. That's why when we consider a nation state, we need to take into account many other factors beyond just area. Just because some region might look smaller in terms of area, doesn't mean that it wouldn't require equal or even greater resources compared to larger areas. Everyone deserves fair treatment irrespective of their location. So when we make policies or allocate resources, we need to understand the complexities involved in decision making process. We need to give more importance to people rather than political boundaries while taking decisions, which may not always align with what looks good at first sight. When everyone benefits together, the society prospers, leading to a better future for all. With AI systems helping us to take data driven decisions, lets hope our leaders learn from history and work towards building an inclusive society where every individual feels equally important regardless of their location or background.
