I would recommend asking more specific questions so that I can provide better information. If you want to know anything about Diabetes or any medical topic please ask!\n\nHere's some extra information regarding each point:\n\nC) According to Wikipedia Prediabetes is defined as \"prediabetes (CDC definition)[6] is the state where blood glucose levels[7] are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes.\" In addition prediabetes is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing both cardiovascular disease[8][9] and type 2 diabetes.[3][4][5] There is evidence to support that if people with pre-diabetes make lifestyle changes such as exercise and healthy eating they may prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes[10] Prediabetes itself increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases,[8][9] although to a lesser extent than type 2 diabetes does. Cardiovascular disease includes coronary artery disease (angina pectoris/heart attack), peripheral arterial disease, and stroke.[11] Other complications may include osteoporosis.[12]\n\nD) As mentioned above, Insulin suppresses the activity of glycogen synthase which is responsible for regulating the conversion of glucose into glycogen. This helps maintain appropriate blood sugar levels.
