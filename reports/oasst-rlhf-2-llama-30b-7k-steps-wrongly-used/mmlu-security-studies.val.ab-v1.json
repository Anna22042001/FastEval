Historical materialism is a theory that seeks to explain social change through an analysis of economic activity and its relationship to technological advances and class conflict. Discourse refers to language use and communication, particularly among groups of people who share common interests or goals. The two concepts are related because discourse can be used to examine how ideas about power, inequality, and social change are shaped by different economic and societal factors. For example, discourse around issues like trade agreements or tax policy might reflect underlying tensions between different classes or interest groups competing over resources. In this sense, understanding these dynamics requires analyzing both the economic and ideational aspects of society. Therefore, option C is the best answer. Option A is incorrect because it suggests HM neglects politics and instead prioritizes \"lived experience,\" which is not accurate. Option B is also wrong since HM does not exclusively focus on discourse; rather, it views all phenomena as interconnected and attempts to understand their relationships.

This approach is often associated with liberalism and cosmopolitanism, which emphasize the importance of protecting individual rights and promoting global solidarity.

This definition comes from the field of political science/international relations, specifically realism and neorealism. Realists argue that states are rational actors that act in their own self-interest, which is defined as increasing power relative to other states (either through absolute or comparative gains). Greed refers to the motivation of states to increase their share of world power for its own sake, whereas security refers to the desire of states to be safe from attack and coercion from other states (i.e., to maintain homeostasis). In summary, greedy states focus on increasing their share of world power regardless of how much power they already have, whereas security-seeker states focus on preserving their current position within the balance of power. Some examples of \"greedy\" states include Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Soviet Union (post-WW2), United States (pre-WW2), and China today. Some examples of \"security-seeker\" states include France, UK, USSR (pre-WW2), US (post-WW2), and contemporary EU countries.
