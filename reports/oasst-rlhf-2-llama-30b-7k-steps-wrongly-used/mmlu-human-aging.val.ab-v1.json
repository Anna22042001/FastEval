This helps to prevent them from becoming cancerous. However, it's worth noting that there can be other differences between cancer cells and normal cells as well, depending on the specific circumstances. For example, some cancer cells may also have different gene expression profiles or alterations in genes related to cell cycle control compared to normal cells. Telomeres play a role in protecting chromosome ends from degradation during DNA replication, but they don't directly cause or protect against cancer. Instead, changes in telomerase activity and/or telomere length can contribute to the development of certain types of cancer under certain conditions, such as by allowing cells to avoid senescence or facilitating the formation of a tumor mass. So while option B isn't entirely incorrect, it might be more accurate to say that normal cells with high telomerase levels can resist senescence and potentially develop into cancer if they acquire additional mutations or other factors promoting malignant transformation. Option C is mostly incorrect because telomeres shorten over time due to regular DNA replication, not necessarily because the cell is transforming into a cancer cell, although very short telomeres can trigger senescence in normal somatic cells. Option D is incorrect because cancer cells usually do express telomerase and maintain relatively long telomeres, at least initially; however, this doesn't mean that all cancer cells will have intact telomeric structures. In summary, I would recommend going with option A, although you could supplement your explanation with additional details about telomeres and telomerase as relevant.

Older adults tend to have smaller, closer circles of friends than younger adults who may have larger, looser networks of acquaintances. While it's not necessarily true across the board, older adults often prioritize quality over quantity in their relationships and invest more heavily in a few close friendships rather than many casual ones. Additionally, as people age they may experience changes in social circumstances or health status that can impact their ability to maintain broader social connections. However, this does not mean they are any less capable of forming meaningful bonds - quite the contrary! In fact, some research suggests that older adults can experience greater well-being through their close personal relationships. Ultimately, the nature of friendship evolves throughout our lives but remains an important aspect of human connection regardless of age. I hope this helps clarify things!
