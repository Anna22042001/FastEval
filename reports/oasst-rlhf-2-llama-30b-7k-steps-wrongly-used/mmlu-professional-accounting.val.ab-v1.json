Since there are ten annual cash inflows and one terminal benefit, we can set up a time line as follows:\n\nYear 0 (today): Initial cash outlay (ICO)\nYear 1: $2,500\nYear 2: $2,500 * (1 + 8%) ^ 1 = $2,714\nYear 3: $2,500 * (1 + 8%) ^ 2 = $2,942\n...\nYear 10: $2,500 * (1 + 8%) ^ 10 = $4,275\nTerminal Benefit: $5,000\n\nUsing the Present Value Formula, we can write the following equation:\n\nPV = ICO + ($2,500 / (1+8%)^1) + ($2,714 / (1+8%)^2) + ... + ($4,275 / (1+8%)^10) + ($5,000 / (1+8%)^11)\n\nWe want to find ICO such that PV = 0. To do so, we set the left side equal to zero and solve for ICO. This results in a complex algebraic expression involving the payment amounts and the rate of return.

This statement is true because accelerated depreciation methods allow companies to deduct higher depreciation expenses earlier, thus reducing their tax liability sooner. This can result in higher after-tax cash flow values for the company, making it more attractive financially. However, other factors such as inflation rates, cost of capital, discount rate, and risk must also be considered when evaluating investment projects. Ultimately, the goal is to maximize shareholder wealth by choosing projects that generate positive net present value (NPV).\n\nIt's worth noting that different depreciation methods may be used for financial accounting and tax purposes, but this doesn't mean they won't affect cash flows or NPV. Therefore, it's important to consider both the financial and tax implications when analyzing potential investments. Additionally, while taxes may not always play a significant role in capital budgeting decisions, they can still have an influence in certain situations.
