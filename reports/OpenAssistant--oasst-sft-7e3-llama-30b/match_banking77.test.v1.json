If you have an iPad or tablet you can download the Monzo App from the Apple store to your iPad and register for an account using your phone number as your login method. Once registered you should be able to see all your accounts details including balances etc. As soon as you receive a new phone you can link your newly ordered sim and log back into your Monzo Account through their website using your registered email address. This will allow you to start transacting again.\n2. Alternatively if you are close friends or family with someone who has already opened a Monzo account, they can add you as a second user to their account and once added, you can then open up the app and complete registration yourself.\n3. Finally, if none of these options work, when calling customer support make sure to explain your situation and ask them what would be possible based upon your specific circumstances. They might be able to help you find another solution.
