Additionally, many companies also strive to build long-term value for their stakeholders through strategic investments, community involvement, and ethical practices.\n\n    B) Stakeholders have differing levels of power\n\nWhile it's true that different stakeholders hold varying degrees of influence over a company's decisions, this does not necessarily mean that they have competing interests or are at odds with each other. Rather, various stakeholder groups often work together to achieve common goals, such as increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving quality, and creating a positive reputation.\n\n    C) Managerial self-interest can lead to poor decision making\n\nIt's important to recognize that managers operate within a complex system where personal motivations and incentives play an influential role in shaping business strategy and decisionmaking. However, excessive managerial self-interest can sometimes result in suboptimal outcomes for the organization as a whole. For example, if management focuses too heavily on short-term gains, they may neglect longer-term considerations, leading to erosion of brand image, decreased competitiveness, and reduced profits.\n\n    D) Ownership and control is separated\n\nIn some cases, ownership and control may be separate entities, but this doesn't necessarily create conflict or prevent effective corporate governance.

The term \"corporate power\" refers to the ability of large businesses to exercise control over government policies and decisions. This includes tactics such as lobbying, campaign financing, and forming alliances with politicians and other powerful entities.\nb. According to Bain and March, transnational corporations (TNCs) can have particularly strong powers because they operate across multiple countries and can exert influence on local economies and politics.\nc. While both political and commercial factors can contribute to an organization's power, it typically falls under the purview of the latter. TNCs often engage in complex transactions that involve numerous parties and require them to navigate different legal systems and cultural norms. This can create opportunities for them to gain leverage over others and exert pressure on decision-makers.\nd. It is difficult to definitively identify the specific source of corporate power, but some scholars believe that neoliberal policies and deregulation have facilitated the growth of monopolies and weakened traditional barriers to entry.
