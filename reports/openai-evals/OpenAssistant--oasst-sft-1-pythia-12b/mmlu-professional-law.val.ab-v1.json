However, in this case, the presence of chemical substances, cooking supplies, and containers with the man's prints on them does not constitute an emergency situation that would justify a warrantless search. Additionally, it would have been relatively simple for the police to obtain a warrant after their initial discovery of these items. Therefore, we cannot conclude that exigent circumstances existed in this case.\n\nConsent may also provide justification for a warrantless search. However, in this case, the man did not give his explicit consent to the search. Instead, he merely allowed the sanitation workers to pick up the trash at the end of each day, which did not necessarily imply consent to a full-blown search of the garbage cans. Moreover, even if the man had given his tacit consent to the search, the scope of that consent would have been limited to what was necessary to complete the pickup job. Thus, we cannot find that consent provided sufficient grounds for the search.\n\nIn conclusion, since neither exigent circumstances nor consent justified the warrantless search of the garbagecans in this case, the evidence obtained from those searches should be excluded from trial.
