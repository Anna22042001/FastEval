These include obligations such as the United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 establishing sanctions against Iraq during its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which required Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face consequences.\n\n    Non-compliance with a decision of an international court or tribunal: A non-injured state may also invoke the responsibility of a guilty state when it refuses to comply with a decision made by an international court or tribunal.

It also helps ensure that the rule applies equally to all member states, regardless of their level of development or unique circumstances.\n\nWhile it's true that the consistent practice of many states may also contribute to the formation of a generally recognized custom, the primary factor in determining whether a custom has been established is the legal judgment or pronouncement by a competent authority. This can take the form of a judicial decision, an opinion issued by an expert body such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or even a formal agreement reached among states.\n\nIt's worth noting that not every instance of conduct that might be considered violative of international law would necessarily give rise to a recognizable custom of law. For example, some actions may be so clearly illegal under international law that they would never be considered legitimate forms of behavior within a given state or group of states.

If one state takes action that benefits another state, the latter might be more likely to take similar action in the future.
