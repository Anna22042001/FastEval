These x-rays may provide limited information about the patient's abdomen and can be uncomfortable for the patient. In addition, they do not typically yield useful information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nC) Ultrasonography of the upper abdomen is a common imaging study used to evaluate various abdominal conditions, such as abdominal masses, inflammation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In this case, while an ultrasound of the upper abdomen may be of some value in evaluating the patient's symptoms, a CT scan of the abdomen would provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient's condition.\n\nD) Upper gastrointestinal series is a procedure that involves drinking a barium solution and then undergoing an upper gastrointestinal examination to evaluate the patient's stomach and digestive system. This procedure is not usually recommended as a primary imaging study for patients with abdominal pain and vomiting. In this case, a CT scan of the abdomen would provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient's condition and could help to identify any underlying abdominal condition that could be causing the patient's symptoms.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAn obese 33-year-old woman has had four 12-hour episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen associated with vomiting but no fever.

It has several mechanisms of action, including the potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, which can calm hyperactive neurons. Lithium also appears to modulate the activity of various neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine and serotonin.\n\nIn the patient you described, lithium would likely be effective in alleviating his symptoms of mania and depression. Additionally, lithium's antimanic properties might also help reduce the risk of self-harm or suicide.
