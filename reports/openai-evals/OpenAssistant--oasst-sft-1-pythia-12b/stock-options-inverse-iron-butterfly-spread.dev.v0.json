The strike prices of the puts are $100, $150, and $200. Therefore, the intrinsic values of these options will depend on the current share price of the company.\n\nThe option that has the highest intrinsic value is the $200 strike price call. This option allows the investor to purchase 100 shares of the company at a cost of $2,000 ($200 x 0.10), which is lower than the initial investment of $2,500. Thus, this option represents an excellent opportunity for the investor to make a profit if the share price increases.\n\nOn the other hand, the option with the lowest intrinsic value is the $100 strike price put. This option requires the investor to sell 100 shares of the company at a loss of $1,000 ($100 x 0.01). As a result, the breakeven price of this option will necessarily be higher than the breakeven price of the other options.\n\nBased on our analysis, the optimal strategy for investing in these options would be to sell the $200 strike price call and buy the $175 strike price put. By doing so, the investor can expect to realize a net return of approximately 5% (($20,000 - $15,000)/$20,000 = 5%), assuming that the share price remains stable over the next 12 months.
