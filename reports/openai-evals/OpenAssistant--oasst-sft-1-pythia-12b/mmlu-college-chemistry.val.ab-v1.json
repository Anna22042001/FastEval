The 13C spectrum of which isomer of C6H14 has lines with three distinct chemical shifts because it consists of three different carbon atoms. The chemical shifts are the positions of the carbon atoms in the molecule relative to the chemical standard carbon (13C), which has a chemical shift of 77.0 ppm.\n\nIn the spectrum of C6H14, the three distinct chemical shifts are found at 74.2, 71.4, and 66.9 ppm, which correspond to the carbon atoms at positions 1, 2, and 3 in the structure, respectively. These chemical shifts are evidence of the different hybridization states of the carbon atoms in the molecule. In particular, the chemical shift at 71.4 ppm is indicative of a sp3 hybridization state for the carbon atom at position 2, while the 74.2 and 66.9 ppm chemical shifts are indicative of sp2 hybridization states for the carbon atoms at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the three distinct chemical shifts found in the 13C spectrum of C6H14 indicate that it is an isomer of C6H14 where the carbon atoms at positions 1, 2, and 3 are involved in different hybridization states, consistent with the structure of 2,3-Dimethylbutane.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe 13C spectrum of which isomer of C6H14 has lines with three distinct chemical shifts?\nA) 2-methylpentane\nB) hexane\nC) 2,3-dimethylbutane\nD) 3-methylpentane", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 20:43:18.386362+00:00"}

The calculation of the polarization is performed by the Larmor formula:\n\n```\nP = (e/2mc) x (B^2/4π) x (x^2 + y^2)^(-3/2)\n```\n\nwhere P is the polarization, e is the elementary charge, m is the mass of the proton, B is the magnetic field strength, and x and y are the coordinates of the proton.\n\nIn the equation, the first factor, (e/2mc), is the magnetic moment of the proton. In a strong magnetic field, the magnetic moment becomes significant, and the magnetic field effectively interacts with the proton through this factor.\n\nThe second factor, (B^2/4π), is a consequence of the Lenz law. In a magnetic field, the negatively charged electron in the proton can feel a force from the magnetic field that tries to align its spin with the magnetic field. This force can exert a force on the proton, causing it to be polarized.\n\nThe third factor, (x^2 + y^2)^(-3/2), takes into account the fact that the proton is a 3D object and takes into account the fact that the magnetic moments are directed along the spin of the proton.\n\nIn the calculation, we are assuming a magnetic field of 335 mT (0.335 T) and a magnetic field of 10.5 T (10.5 T).

The reducing agent, NaBH4, acts as a dehydration agent to remove water from the molecule of D-xylose, creating two stereoisomers (left and right) of reduced D-xylose. The resulting product is a mixture of these two diastereomers, which are characterized by the presence of two stereocenters and are hence called diastereomers.
