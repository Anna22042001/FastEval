Heat from the Sun is absorbed by the planet's surface, and it is then released as heat and water vapor through the process of convective heat transfer. This heat transfer occurs more quickly for smaller planets that have a lower surface area and a smaller volume, resulting in faster energy loss.\n\nIn Earth, for example, the amount of energy retained in the interior as heat depends on the total mass of the planet and the heat capacity of its interior. As Earth grows in size, its mass and heat capacity both increase, resulting in a slower rate of energy loss.

At its current distance, the Sun's rays are too weak to cause significant variations in temperature or weather on Venus. Additionally, the thick atmosphere of Venus makes it difficult for sunlight to reach the ground, which also limits the capacity for season variation.\n\nThe unique orientation of Venus's rotation axis and its orbital configuration also play a role in its lack of seasons. The axis of rotation of Venus is perpendicular to its orbital plane, which means that the planet always shows the same side to the Sun. This means that the western and eastern sides of Venus receive different amounts of sunlight and heat, leading to the emergence of different weather patterns and seasons on the planet.\n\nIn comparison to Mars and Earth, Venus has a much slower rotation rate and a shorter lifespan. Its current rotation period is About 225 days, which is much shorter than the Earth's 365-day seasons or Mars's approximately 24-hour rotation periods.\n\nAdditionally, Venus's atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, which do not absorb much heat from the Sun and do not create an efficient greenhouse effect.
