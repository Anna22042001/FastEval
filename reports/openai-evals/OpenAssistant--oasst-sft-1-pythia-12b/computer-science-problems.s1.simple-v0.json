In binary tree sort, the postorder traversal step involves visiting each node in the tree in reverse order (from left to right), sorting its children according to the sorted ordering of the parents, and then repeating the process for the remaining subtrees.

The preorder traversal step is similar, but it visits the tree in forward order instead.
