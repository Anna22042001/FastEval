The underlying security in this strategy is 100 Shares of Stock, which will be purchased or sold at a Price per Share equal to the Exercise Price (i.e., $1.27 / share) for the $300 Strike Price Call and the Offer Price (i.e., $10.30 / share) for the $275 Strike Price Call, respectively.\n\nIn this Strategy, the Expiration Date for both Options is February 29, 2023. This means that if the stock price remains above the $300 Strike Price until February 29, 2023, then theOption Holder will receive a payment of $300 (the Premium) from the seller of the $300 Strike Price Call, and will have the right to purchase 100 Shares of Stock at the $325 Price on or before February 29, 2023. Conversely, if the stock price falls below the $300 Strike Price by February 29, 2023, then the Option Holder will lose the entire premium paid for the $300 Strike Price Call and will not have the right to purchase any Shares of Stock.\n\nThe other Option Strategy involved in this transaction is a sell-sell Strategy, where both Options have the same expiration date and exercise price. In this Strategy, the Option holder sells the $300 Strike Price Call and purchases the $275 Strike Price Call, simultaneously protecting their position against a rise in the stock price up to the $325 Exercise Price. If the stock price rises above the $325 Exercise Price prior to expiration, the Optionholder will make a profit equal to the difference between the Purchase Price ($325) and the Sale Price ($300).
