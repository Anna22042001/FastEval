The summary shows that $20.75 CAD was paid as part of the Ultimate Flight pass. This means that there were other payments also made to Air Canada in addition to this one payment of $20.75 CAD. We can see this by looking at the breakdown of the total amount paid (which includes fees and taxes). In the summary, it shows that there is a total paid of $40.00 CAD. Because there are multiple payments listed, let's record them all so we know what each payment was for.\n\nThe summary lists two types of payments: an Ultimate Flight pass and a Total Payments header. To record both types of payments, add the following code after the line where you recorded the $20.75 CAD payment:\n```python\ntotal_payments = float(order[\"TotalPayments\"]) + float(order[\"UltimateFlightPassPrice\"])\n```\nThis adds the `TotalPayments` and `UltimateFlightPassPrice` fields to our dataframe. Now, when we look at these columns, we will be able to identify which payments correspond to which Air Canada flights.\n\nFinally, let's sum up the total $value paid to Air Canada. We can do this by adding together the amounts from each row in the `TotalPayments` column:\n```python\naircanada_value = sum([float(p) for p in order['TotalPayments']])\n```\nAnd voila!
