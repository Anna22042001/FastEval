The PDI measures three dimensions of culturaldistance: horizontal (i.e., social distance), vertical (i.e.,power distance), and diagonal (i.e.,cultural openness).horizontal: High values on this dimension indicate that people in different cultures tend to view each other as equal or similar; low values on this dimension indicate that people in different cultures tend to view one another as differently situated.vertical: High values on this dimension indicate that individuals have relatively little say in important decisions; low values on this dimension indicate that individuals have significant say in important decisions.diagonal: Low values on this dimension suggest that people in different cultures share a common set of beliefs and values; high values on this dimension suggest that people in different cultures hold diverse beliefs and values.\n\nHofstede's theory suggests that cultural differences between countries can be understood through these three dimensions of culturaldistance. For example, high values on the horizontal dimension may lead to more egalitarian social structures and policies in a country, while high values on the vertical dimension may lead to greater concentration of political power at the top of society. Additionally, low values on the diagonal dimension may contribute to feelings of discomfort and conflict within society, as groups holding differing beliefs and values struggle to find common ground.\n\nIn conclusion, the PDI is a useful tool for measuring culturaldistance and understanding how different national cultures organize themselves around power distances.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nPower distance in national cultures is a characteristic of a model by which writer?\nA) David Yip\nB) Geert Hofstede\nC) Tony Purdie\nD) Michael Porter", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-23 12:35:15.411803+00:00"}
