According to Maslow, these needs are arranged in a hierarchical order, with the most basic needs at the bottom and the most abstract needs at the top.\n\nIn Maslow's theory, belongingness is seen as the foundation of all other needs. Belongingness refers to a sense of connection to others and a feeling of being part of a community. It involves a sense of belonging to a group, feeling a sense of safety and security within the group, and having a sense of purpose and significance in the world.\n\nAs such, it is crucial to satisfy the basic needs of belongingness before aspiring to satisfy higher needs such as self-esteem and social acceptance.
