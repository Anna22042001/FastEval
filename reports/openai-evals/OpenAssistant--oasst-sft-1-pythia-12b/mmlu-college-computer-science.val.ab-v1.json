This is because we need to scan all elements from 0 up to n - 1, compare each element to the target value, and then replace it if necessary. The average time required per comparison is therefore O(1), while the total time required is O(n).\n\nIn contrast, a balanced binary search tree (BBT) can be used to find and remove the 7th largest element in log_2(n) steps on average. To do this, we first insert all elements into the BBT using a depth-first approach, so that each node has at most two children. Then, we repeatedly split the root node in half until we reach the desired leaf node containing the target element. In each step, we compare the current node to its left child, right child, and parent; if the current node is larger than both of its children, we swap it with theirparent, otherwise we stop splitting.\n\nSince each comparison takes O(log_2(n)) time, the total time required is O(n * log_2(n)).

To determine whether a given cell contains a reference or pointer, the algorithm simply looks at the current value of the cell's \"NextCellRef\". If it points to another object, the algorithm dereferences that object; otherwise, it increments the NextCellRef value and continues searching until it finds the next reference.
