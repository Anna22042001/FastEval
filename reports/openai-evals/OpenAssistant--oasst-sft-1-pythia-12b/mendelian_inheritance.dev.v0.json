The selected individuals will be crossed with each other to create new offspring. The offspring will inherit pieces of their parents' genes, and the genetic algorithm will use this process of mutation and crossover to evolve the population over time.\n\nIn this step, we'll use a two-way crossover operation to create new offspring.

The offspring will then inherit a mixture of genes from their parents, which will help to introduce variability into the population.\n\nWe'll also use a one-way mutation operation to modify the genes of some individuals in the population. Each mutation will introduce a new type of gene into the population, which can result in some individuals having a different set of wing colors than others.\n\nFinally, the offspring will be evaluated again using the fitness function, and the genetic algorithm will repeat this process of selection, crossover, and mutation until a best-possible solution is found.
