In this strategy, the investor purchases a spread of two options, selling one option with a strike price below the current market price and buying another option with a strike price above the current market price.\n\nThe expiration dates of the options in the strategy are the same, which means that the options will have the same lifespan and will be eligible for expiration at the same time. The expiration date of the call option with the lower strike price is one month before the expiration date of the put option with the higher strike price, which helps to ensure that the options will expire at the same time and that the investor will receive a profit if the stock price increases during that time period.\n\nOverall, the calendar spread strategy is an option-based strategy that involves selling a put option and buying a call option to hedge against a possible decrease in the stock price. While the exact implementation of the strategy may vary, this example involves purchasing a $28 strike price put option and a $29 strike price call option, selling one option at a premium and buying another option at a discount, and then selling the option position at breakeven.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
