This strategy involves selling one Call Option and buying one Put Option on the stock with a strike price of $75 per share. The goal is to take advantage of possible increases or decreases in the stock's price over the duration of the options contract. By purchasing the Put Option, the investor is protected against a decrease in the value of the stock and can make a profit if the stock price rises above the strike price. On the other hand, by selling the Call Option, the investor gains exposure to an increase in the stock's price but also incurs a potential loss if the stock price falls below the strike price. Overall, the sell calls and buy puts strategy offers investors a balanced risk-reward profile, as both options have the potential to generate returns based on changes in the stock's price.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
