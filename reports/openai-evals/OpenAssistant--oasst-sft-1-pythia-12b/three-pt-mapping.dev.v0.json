In this case, we are concerned with the presence or absence of a specific genetic trait, called the TI trait.\n\nLet's first consider the parental combinations for the TI trait. The parents consist of two separate lines of mice, one a homozygote for the TI trait (TIr) and the other a wild-type mouse (TIR). The TI trait is determined by the presence or absence of a dominant mutation, which causes the mice to develop the trait even if they inherit only one copy of the TI gene.\n\nThe crosses between the two parental lines result in offspring that contain either one copy of the TI gene (TI+), both copies (TI++), or neither copy (TI-). Based on the number of offspring produced by each cross, we can determine the contribution of each parent to the TI trait.\n\nFor example, in the cross between the TIr and TIR mice, we expect there to be three TI+ offspring, six TI++ offspring, and nine TI- offspring. By combining the counts of the offspring for each cross, we can determine the proportion of TI- offspring that resulted from the TIR parent (27%) and the TIr parent (73%).\n\nBased on this information, we can identify the TI allele in the middle of the triad as the TIr parent, as it contributed 73% of the TI- offspring.

For simplicity, let's assume that the genotypic values are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the absence, presence, and intermediate alleles, respectively.\n\nWe start by selecting three individuals at random from the population. These individuals are known as the \"control individuals.\" We then calculate the number of offspring that each control individual produces, based on its genotype:\n\nControl individual 1: If its genotype is A, it produces two offspring with a probability of 0.5. If its genotype is B, it produces one offspring with a probability of 0.5 and a second offspring with a probability of 0.25. If its genotype is C, it produces no offspring.\nControl individual 2: If its genotype is A, it produces two offspring with a probability of 0.5. If its genotype is B, it produces one offspring with a probability of 0.5 and a second offspring with a probability of 0.25. If its genotype is C, it produces no offspring.\nControl individual 3: If its genotype is A, it produces two offspring with a probability of 0.5. If its genotype is B, it produces one offspring with a probability of 0.5 and a second offspring with a probability of 0.25. If its genotype is C, it produces no offspring.\n\nBased on the number of offspring produced by each control individual, we can calculate the average number of offspring produced by each control individual:\n\nControl individual 1: If its genotype is A, it produces 2/3 * 2 = 4 offspring.
