The three-point testcross involves mating two parents (1) and (2), creating four possible combinations of gametes: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4); (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4); (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), and (3, 4).\nIn each combination, there are two chromosomes that carry different versions of the same gene. In one parent, the version of the gene will be A; in the other parent, it will be B. When these gametes fuse together, the resulting zygote has a mix of both versions of the gene. This means that there are four possibilities for the final genetic makeup of the organism: either two copies of A (AA or AB), two copies of B (BB or BA), or a mix of both (AB or BA).\nTo identify the middleallele, we can look at the total number of offspring produced by each combination of parents. In each case, there will be one copy of the dominantallele and one copy of the recessiveallele. If we count the number of offspring from each combination, we'll see that the combination involving parent (1) produces twice as many offspring as any other combination: (1, 1) creates 8 offspring, (1, 2) creates 4 offspring, etc. Since there are only four possible combinations, there must be an allelle in the middle that's shared between two of them: (1, 3) and (1, 4), which create 4 offspring apiece.\nSince all the offspring have the same genetic makeup (one copy of the dominantallele and one copy of the recessiveallele), they must come from the same parent. Therefore, the allelle in the middle must be inherited from parent (1).", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Given the result of a three-point test cross with each line of input containing a genotype and the corresponding number of offspring, find the allele in the middle.

The three-point testCross algorithm takes as input two lines of text: one containing the individual's genootype (in uppercase) and another containing the expected number of offspring for that individual. It then calculates the probability of each possible combination of alleles at the three genetic markers using a mathematical formula called Bayes' theorem. Finally, it selects the most likely combination as the answer.\n\nIn this case, the first line contains the following information:\n\n    genootype = MAp 95\n    expected_offspring = mAp 52 + maP 85 + map 11\n\nSo the probability of each allele being present at the third marker can be calculated by multiplying its frequency in the population (0.2 for A, 0.8 for B and 1.0 for both C and D) by the sum of the probabilities of all other possible combinations of allelic states at the second and third markers:\n\n    A * (0.8 + 0.1 + 0.04) / ((0.8 + 0.1 + 0.04) ** 3)\n    B * (0.4 + 0.6 + 0.08) / ((0.4 + 0.6 + 0.08) ** 3)\n    C * (0.2 + 0.4 + 0.6) / ((0.2 + 0.4 + 0.6) ** 3)\n    D * (0.8 + 0.2 + 0.4) / ((0.8 + 0.2 + 0.4) ** 3)\n\nThese probabilities are then used to calculate the posterior odds of each possible combination, which are compared to a precomputed threshold value to determine the most probable solution.
