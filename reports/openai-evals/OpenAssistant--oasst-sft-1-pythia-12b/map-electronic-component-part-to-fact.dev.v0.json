However, we can make an estimate based on some general information about steppers and their construction.\n\nIn most cases, a stepper motor consists of multiple small metal cylinders that spin around a central axis. The overall size and shape of these components varies depending on the specific model, but they typically weigh between 5 and 15 grams per cylinder.\n\nTo calculate the weight of the stepper motor, we would need to know the number of cylinders, their diameter, and their total length. Unfortunately, this information is often unavailable for custom-built motors.\n\nHowever, we can make an educated guess by considering some commonly used stepper motor models. For example, the popular model SYS8418A weighs approximately 10 grams per cylinder, while the similar-sized SYS8118A weighs just 8 grams per cylinder. By using this as a reference point, we could make a rough estimate for the weight of the Sy 42 STH 47 - 1206 A motor by scaling up or down accordingly.\n\nIt's important to note that this estimate is only a starting point and may be off by a few grams.
