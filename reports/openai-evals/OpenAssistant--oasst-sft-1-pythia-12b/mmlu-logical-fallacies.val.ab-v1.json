For example, a person who claims that they are right about their political beliefs may attack anyone who disagrees as being biased or wrong.\n\n2. Appeal to Authority: This is where the person quotes or refers to an authority figure, without properly checking the validity of that authority's ideas or opinions. For example, a person who quotes a doctor's opinion about their health may do so without checking the doctor's credentials or the accuracy of the information they are providing.\n\n3. Slippery Slope: This is a fallacy that occurs when someone assumes that a small action or change will lead to a larger, harmful consequence. For example, a person who supports gun ownership may argue that allowing more guns in society will lead to greater crime, and that we need to take steps to prevent that from happening.\n\n4. Suppressed Evidence: This is a fallacy where evidence that contradicts a person's claim is hidden or denied, and they use that lack of information to support their argument. For example, a person who claims that their employer is taking away their sick days may claim that they can't provide documentation for their sick days, even though they have provided it in the past.\n\nIn the case of the political argument you gave, the person who is making the argument would be guilty of Appeal to Pride, because they assume that their beliefs must be correct simply because they came to them honestly.
