These glands secrete milk, which then flows through ducts and into the nipples of the mother.\n\n    When a female mammal becomes pregnant, her body begins to prepare for milk production. This process involves the development of the breasts, where the milk glands are located.

Once the baby is born, the milk enters the infant's mouth and helps to fulfill its nutritional needs.\n\n    In summary, when a female mammal lactates, she produces milk that provides sustenance for her offspring.
