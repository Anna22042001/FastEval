However, which objections are relevant will depend on the specific arguments being addressed. Let me clarify.\n\nVan den Haag's book, \"The Practice of Moral Judgment\", is dedicated to examining the process by which moral agents make ethical decisions. Van den Haag argues that moral judgment is based on a combination of moral principles and cultural norms, and that it involves a process of abstraction and generalization.\n\nIn his book, van den Haag refutes the claim that emotions play a significant role in moral decision-making. He argues that emotions are not necessary for ethical reasoning and decision-making, and that they can often be misleading or misconstrued.\n\nNathanson's book, \"Moral Tribes: How Evolutionary Psychology Has Transformed Our Understanding of Human Nature and Its Consequences\", is focused on understanding the psychological causes and consequences of moral behavior. Nathanson argues that morality is grounded in human biology and evolved social behaviors, and that it is shaped by the constraints and opportunities in human life.\n\nKant's philosophy, \"Fundamental Writings\", includes his famous \" categorical imperative\", which states that every moral action should be based on a universal principle of moral action. Kant argues that moral agents must act in a categorical way, regardless of their personal desires or beliefs, in order to achieve ethicality.\n\nAbolitionists, such as John Stuart Mill and Harriet Beecher Stowe, argued that the abolition of slavery was a moral matter. They believed that the enslavement of human beings was wrong and morally indefensible, and that it violated basic human rights and dignity.\n\nReiman's objections to the arguments presented by van den Haag, Nathanson, Kant and abolitionists will depend on his particular perspective on these philosophical issues.
