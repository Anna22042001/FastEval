TheBlack-Scholes formula provides us with the expected return on an option based on certain market conditions such as volatility, interest rates, and time to expiry.\n\nThe formula takes into account both the premium (the amount paid by the seller for the option) and the discount (the difference between the current price of the underlying asset and the exercise price of the option). By combining these two components, we can determine the total expected return on the option.\n\nUsing this formula, let's first calculate the premium for each option.

For the sell options, the discount is calculated as follows:\n\n$13.40 - ($242 + $0.06 * 365) / 1000 = $12.90\n\nFor the buy options, the discount is calculated as follows:\n\n($9.88 - $8.70) / 1000 = (-$0.18)\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total expected return on each option using the sum of the premiums and discounts:\n\nSell Option: $5.82 + (-$0.18) = $6.04\nBuy Option: ($2.45) + (-$0.18) = ($1.85)\nTotal Expected Return: $6.04 + ($1.85) = $7.09\nBreakeven Stock Price: $239.75\nNote that the breakeven stock price will depend", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an financial calculator."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Do not include an explanation.
