According to this theory, the earliest forms of human culture were simple and limited to a single domain, such as the home or immediate community. Over time, these simple cultures became more complex and were able to incorporate elements from different domains, eventually developing into more sophisticated forms of culture.\n\nAccording to the Three-Age System, the first age of human culture was the hunter-gatherer stage, which lasted from about 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. During this stage, human groups were dependent on their natural environment for their survival, and their culture was relatively simple and limited to the home and immediate community.\n\nThe second age of human culture was the agricultural stage, which began around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago and dominated human settlement for the next 2,000 years. During this stage, human groups began to organize themselves into larger tribes and developed more sophisticated agriculture, livestock, and trade networks.\n\nThe third age of human culture was the industrial era, which began around the mid-18th century and has shaped modern society. During this era, human groups began to rely on machines and technologies for their survival, and their culture became highly complex and diversified. This era of human culture is characterized by the development of cities, industries, and cultures that are based on the creation and consumption of consumer goods.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the Three-Age System, human culture has evolved through a series of stages, each of which represents a different level of complexity.
