These sticky ends allow DNA to hybridize to other DNA molecules and to be easily joined together. This means that when two DNA molecules are digested with a restriction enzyme, the resulting pieces of DNA will have sticky ends that can pair with each other, forming a circular molecule.\n\nReplication of transfer RNA within the bacterial cell requires the presence of certain enzymes and substrates, including DNA polymerases and ribozymes. These enzymes are able to copy the RNA template using DNA as a template. However, unlike DNA replication, which results in a double-stranded DNA molecule, RNA replication results in a single-stranded DNA molecule. This is because the RNA molecule is first copied into a complementary DNA molecule, and then the complement is removed to allow for the second copying of the RNA template.\n\nRegarding the selection for plasmids lacking antibiotic resistance, this process is commonly used to identify and remove conjugative plasmids that carry antibiotic-resistant genes. Plasmids can be transformed into bacteria, and when cells are grown in the presence of the antibiotic, those cells that carry the resistance gene will grow, while those cells that do not carry the gene will not. By growing colonies of bacteria on plates containing the antibiotic, those colonies that carry the resistance gene can be easily identified.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe “sticky ends” generated by restriction enzymes allow\nA) pieces of DNA from different sources to hybridize to each other and to be joined together\nB) replication of transfer RNA within the bacterial cell\nC) easy identification of plasmids which carry an insert\nD) selection for plasmids lacking antibiotic resistance", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 22:03:14.811439+00:00"}
