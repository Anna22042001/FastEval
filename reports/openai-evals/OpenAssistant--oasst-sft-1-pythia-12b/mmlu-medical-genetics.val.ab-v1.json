Heritability refers to the degree to which the characteristics of an individual are determined by their genes. It measures the extent to which the appearance, behavior, or other traits of an individual are influenced by genetics. The term \"heritability\" does not refer to the percentage of variation observed within a population that can be attributed to genetic differences. This concept is known as \"genetic variance.\"\n\nIn humans, for example, heritability estimates range from around 0.8 (for height, intelligence, and skin color) to nearly 1 (for most behavioral and physiological traits). This means that most of the variations we see among individuals within a given population can be explained by genetics. However, it's important to note that heritability does not tell us exactly how much each trait is influenced by genetics, only that there is some genetic component involved.\n\nThe terms \"linkage,\" \"proportions,\" and \"variance\" are related to one another but have distinct meanings. Linkage refers to the tendency for nearby genes to be inherited together.
