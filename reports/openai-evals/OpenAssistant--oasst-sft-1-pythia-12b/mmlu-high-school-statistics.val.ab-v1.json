In survey research, it typically refers to a type of error that occurs when the results of a study are influenced by certain biases or differences in the population under investigation. Here are some common types of survey bias:\n\n    1. Representativeness: This refers to whether the sample accurately reflects the overall population. If the sample is not representative, then the findings may not be applicable to the entire population. For example, if a study focuses on young people who use social media, the findings may not apply to adults who do not use social media.\n\n    2. Sampling bias: This refers to the difference in the selection of participants compared to the total population. If the sample is biased towards a particular group (e.g., older individuals), then the findings may not be generalizable to the wider population.\n\n    3. Response bias: This refers to the tendency for participants to provide responses that are consistent with their beliefs or attitudes. For instance, if a study asks about political views, there might be a response bias where participants agree with the researchers' conclusions even though they did not participate in the study themselves.\n\n    4. Interviewer bias: This refers to the influence of the interviewers on the responses obtained from participants. For instance, if the interviewers are biased against a particular group (e.g., African Americans), then the responses provided by those participants may be affected.\n\n    5. Observer bias: This refers to the potential for observers to introduce their own biases into the data collection process. For example, if the researcher collects data through observation rather than direct questioning, there could be observer bias where the researcher's personal perspectives affect the way they interpret the data.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just a few examples of survey bias, and other sources of bias may exist depending on the specific context of the study. It's always important to consider the potential biases in the design", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIn sample surveys, what is meant by bias?\nA) Prejudice, as in ethnic and gender-related studies.\nB) A systematic error in a sampling method that leads to an unrepresentative sample.\nC) Tendency for some distributions to be skewed.\nD) Natural variability seen between samples.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-23 12:18:42.381303+00:00"}

This choice is based on the fact that there is no information provided about the distribution of the cards or how they were shuffled. A binominal probability model assumes that the events being modeled are independent and have equal probabilities of occurring. In this case, it makes sense to calculate the probability of drawing each card given that all 52 cards have been drawn (i.e., 4/52), then multiply those probabilities together to get the overall probability of drawing all four aces.\n\nIn comparison, Options A, B, and D do not take into account the specific arrangement of the cards or the distance from the child to the basket.
