In sampling, you stratify the sample into different groups, each of which receives different treatments or exposure variables. In doing so, you can then analyze the data to determine if the treatments have an effect on the outcomes of interest. Blocking in experiments is a similar approach, in which you divide the sample into different treatment groups and then randomly assign them to different conditions or treatments. By doing this, you can control for any pre-existing differences between the groups and avoid biases that could occur when assigning treatments based on other variables.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following is a true statement?\nA) In an experiment, researchers decide on the treatment but typically allow the subjects to self-select into the control group.\nB) Stratifying in sampling is the same idea as blocking for experiments.\nC) If properly designed, either observational studies or controlled experiments can easily be used to establish cause and effect.\nD) While observational studies gather information on an already existing condition, they still often involve intentionally forcing some treatment to note the response.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 21:36:51.225204+00:00"}
