Snell's law of refraction, which states that the refractive index (n) of a material is dependent on the angle of incidence (θ), can be derived using Fermat's principle of ray optics. This principle states that the total time of travel for a ray moving from one point to another is dependent on the path taken and the speed of the ray. When the refractive index of a medium is different from that of the surrounding space, a ray will be bent as it travels through the medium. According to Snell's law, the refractive index of the material facing the incident ray can be calculated as follows:\n\nn = 1 + (V/c), where V is the velocity of the ray in the material and c is the speed of light.\n\nWhen the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of refraction, the refractive index is said to be \"index of refraction\". If the refractive index of the material is greater than 1, the ray will bend towards the normal direction. If the refractive index is less than 1, the ray will bend away from the normal direction.\n\nThe law of reflection, on the other hand, states that the ratio of the reflection coefficient (ρ) to the refractive index (n) is equal to the cosine of the angle of incidence. According to the law of reflection, the reflection coefficient can be calculated as follows:\n\nρ = (n^2 - 1)^(1/2).\n\nIf the refractive index of the material is equal to 1, the law of reflection predicts that the reflection coefficient will be equal to 1. If the refractive index is greater than 1, the reflection coefficient will be less than 1, and if the refractive index is less than 1, the reflection coefficient will be greater than 1.\n\nIn conclusion, Snell's law of refraction and the law of reflection can be derived using Fermat's principle of ray optics", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFermat’s principle of ray optics states, “A ray of light follows the path between two points which requires the least time.” This principle can be used to derive which of the following?\r\nI.
