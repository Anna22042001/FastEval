In the first example, the application of the \"K\" operator results in the deletion of the small dark circle, which leaves us with just the large light circles. Similarly, when we apply the \"L\" operator, we duplicate the small light triangle, resulting in two copies of the smaller triangle. Next, we apply the \"M\" operator, changing the shading and shape of the larger circle, before applying the \"N\" operator to delete the original small dark circle.\n\nFinally, we apply the same process to our input sequence, starting with the application of the \"K\" operator, followed by the \"L\" operator, and so on.

There are two such reflections that result in an image that forms a smaller triangle when reflected again about the same line. Each reflection involves a horizontal shift of the center of gravity, which results in a change of the second figure by two units along the vertical axis. Since the second figure always increases by two, we see that the first two figures form a descending staircase of length 2n where n is the number of steps. We can calculate the total number of steps as follows:\n2(n+1)-1 = 2n + 2\nSince both images have a height of 4 units, the total height of the staircase is 8 units.
