Instead, the activity ofCK is primarily regulated by the level of phosphocreatine, which serves as a storage form of cellular energy. When energy consumption is high, the amount of phosphocreatine decreases, leading to increased levels of free ADP and inorganic phosphate, which activateCK and initiate the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose for use in energy metabolism.
