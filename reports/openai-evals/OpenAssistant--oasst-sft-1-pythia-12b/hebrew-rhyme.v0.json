The reason for this is that Hebrew has no traditional phonetic alphabet like English does, so it cannot directly represent sounds. Instead, Hebrew uses letters to create words, and the order of these letters can sometimes influence the way words sound. For example, the letter א (ayin) can be used to make certain consonants, while the letter ח (chet) can be used to make certain vowels.
