If we assume that no two cubes have the same orientation or edge length, and we ignore the volume of the boxes for now, then there will be 8 cubes that can fit comfortably inside the smaller box: 2x3x4 = 24 total cubes. However, if we allow for cube orientations to vary and include the volume of the boxes, the actual number of cubes that can fit might be different. For example, if we consider all possible permutations of the three axes and count the cubes that lie within the larger box but not within any of the smaller boxes, we would get 36 total cubes.
