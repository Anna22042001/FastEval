Here's an explanation of each possible scenario:\n\n    Voltage rating: If only one brush is damaged, the total voltage across the generator will still remain at its normal value (usually around 600 volts). However, the remaining three brushes will continue to provide the same amount of load as before, so the overall efficiency of the generator will not be affected. In this case, the voltage rating would stay the same (e.g., 4200 volts), but the actual output voltage may decrease slightly due to losses caused by the unbalanced load.\n\n    Current rating: If just one brush is broken, the maximum current that can flow through it will be reduced proportionately. So, for example, if one brush carries 100 amps of current, the other three will still be able to deliver 80 amps apiece. The exact value of the current rating will depend on the specific design of the generator, but it typically falls somewhere between 40 and 60 amps.\n\n    Power rating: If only one brush is broken, the loss in output power will also be proportional to the reduction in current flowing through it. So, for example, if one brush carries 100 amps of current, the other three will still be able to deliver 90 amps apiece. Again, the precise value of the power rating will depend on the specific design of the generator, but it typically falls somewhere between 10 and 20 kilowatts.\n\n    If two or more brushes are broken, the effects on the generator's performance will be much greater.
