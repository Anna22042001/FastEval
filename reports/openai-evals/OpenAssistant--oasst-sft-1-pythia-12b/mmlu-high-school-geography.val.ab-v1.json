This point would serve as the meeting ground for various groups within the city, including workers, shoppers, and business owners, and would help to create an efficient and cohesive infrastructure for conducting daily life.\n\n    Similarly, in his research on urban sprawl, Christaller has argued that excessive suburbanization can have negative effects on the economy, environment, and quality of life in a community. He notes that by focusing investment in the core areas of a city, communities can encourage more compact growth and reduce the need for travel across large distances.\n\n    Finally, in his work on air traffic management, Christaller has suggested that strategic placement of airports can play a significant role in improving the efficiency and reliability of air transport networks. By placing airports near major population centers and key industries, airlines can minimize flight delays and cancellations, while also ensuring that passengers have access to convenient and reliable flights.\n\n    Overall, while Christaller's work on urban planning and central place theory does not explicitly address aviation, these ideas provide important insights into the relationship between space and society, and their potential application to the field of aviation.

Block-based land surveys, also known as aerial photography or lidar (light detection and ranging), have emerged as an alternative approach for managing property boundaries in remote or undeveloped areas where traditional surveying methods are difficult to implement.
