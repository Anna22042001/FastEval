Tibetian Buddhism has a strong focus on meditating on the Buddhist teachings and developing deep spiritual connections with the Buddha and other beings, and some American and Canadian converts to this form of Buddhism have made significant contributions to the development of the tradition in the West.\n\nZen Buddhism, a Japanese form of Buddhism, has also made inroads in North America in recent years, with its emphasis on quiet meditation and the development of spiritual insight being particularly appealing to those who are seeking to simplify their lives and find greater happiness.
