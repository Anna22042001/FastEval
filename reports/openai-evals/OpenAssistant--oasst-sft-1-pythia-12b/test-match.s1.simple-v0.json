Despite her beauty, Princess Peach was spoiled and selfish, and spent much of her time avoiding the responsibilities of her kingdom.\n\nOne day, a wandering wizard named Bowser stumbled upon Princess Peach's kingdom. He was immediately smitten with her beautiful face and decided to cast a spell upon her to make her love him. Princess Peach was terrified by the power of the spell, but agreed to let Bowser marry her in exchange for a powerful enchanteditem.\n\nThe wedding was a grand event, and the guests were entertained by the fantastical wedding dress Princess Peach had been provided. However, as the guests celebrated, they became increasingly concerned that Princess Peach was not happy.\n\nJust as they reached the breaking point, the wedding was interrupted by the appearance of Bowser, who had returned to his domain to claim his prize. The wedding guests were horrified to see that Bowser had transformed Princess Peach into a giant, bloated hog, and he was prepared to use her as his weapon against the kingdom.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to save the kingdom, the wedding guests banded together and cast a spell to defeat Bowser. The spell cast a powerful tornado that transported Bowser and Princess Peach to a remote island, where they lived out the rest of their days as grotesque demons.\n\nFrom that day forward, the kingdom was saved, and the people of Princess Peach's Kingdom lived in harmony, grateful for the heroism of the wedding guests and the sacrifice of Princess Peach.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Complete the phrase as concisely as possible."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Once upon a "}], "options": ["time"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 23:21:45.443946+00:00"}
