Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation.

So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing that data type because that's when we find these really valuable insights. So typically what happens is you might get some data sets maybe 10% of your total interactions come in via chat. At that point, what you tend to see is that the chat data becomes more and more important. As soon as someone has enough confidence to start typing instead of saying, oh gosh, let me click a button. They’re immediately writing real code, solving problems and you can capture that moment. So we believe that we could provide a significant amount of value to organizations that have a meaningful portion of their customer contact via phone.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too? Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. But it's something that I believe has a real impact on business outcomes.\nJane\nI see. And so based on sort of what you told me before and some of the other questions I asked you earlier when I walked in, it sounds like you guys might be in a similar space or potentially overlapping space. What kinds of differences or similarities do you see between your approach and maybe some of the larger players in the market today or even some smaller players perhaps that you think are innovating in this space?", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John. Does the customer mention their favorite dish? Please answer Yes or No. \nJane\nOkay. Good. How bout yourself?\nJohn\nLike my camera just failed.\nJane\nOkay.\nJane\nI'm as well. Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So when we started initially working with some of these companies, you could literally see a lightbulb turn on for them where like oh, okay, we never knew this before. We never thought about this before. So it's like really valuable information to give up front instead of having to dig through a huge dataset like maybe 10 years worth of data. It makes such a big difference. So that's why it's like mission critical for us to help make this process easier and faster.\nJane\nThat makes sense. And then how did you become aware of this area of need?\nJohn\nTo be honest, I stumbled upon this space quite accidentally. I was working at another startup that sort of built something similar to ours and we sort of got acquired by this larger player in the industry. So I found myself kind of in limbo and was like I needed to find something else to do and stumbled across this space and saw this pain point and just felt like there was nothing else that existed to solve this problem so I decided to jump in and build something.\nJane\nAnd what made you believe there wasn’t anything else available?\nJohn\nJust because there weren't many other tools out there doesn't mean they didn't exist though. I actually spent a long time researching this space. There were a few startups that were doing similar things but ultimately, we realized that they either couldn't scale due to resource constraints or they were just missing features that we felt like we had. So we kind of felt like there was room for innovation here.\nJane\nAnd that initial research led you to the opportunity to develop this tool and bring it to market?\nJohn\nYes. Exactly. So once I identified the gap in the market and saw that there was demand for this type of solution, I decided to start building.\nJane\nWhat do you consider the biggest challenges facing today's businesses?\nJohn\nThere's still a lot of legacy systems that companies", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage.

It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing that market space. There might be some competitors in there. Maybe there aren't yet but potentially there could be. We really focused on building something that could help them solve problems faster than other players in that space.\nJane\nOh, okay. Perfect. Yeah, great. Great insights. Well, again, thank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about your product and services. As a startup ourselves, it's really helpful to learn more about these types of tools and how they can assist businesses in achieving their goals.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane.

And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing towards businesses who have good adoption rates and therefore have more structured data available.\nJane\nOkay. That helps. That's helpful because I've seen these kind of challenges before but also really excited about potentially learning something new. Thank you again for reaching out today.\nJohn\nGreat!

See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you? Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep.

You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. Because sometimes when we see like the same thing again and again you might think oh great another example of this issue, but oftentimes these are really valuable insights because the number one cause of failure for SaaS businesses is not technical. Failure happens almost entirely due to lack of understanding and miscommunication.\nJane\nGotcha.\nJane\nSo if we can improve the signal-to-noise ratio and help them identify which topics are worth exploring based on patterns across multiple calls that could save everyone a ton of time.\nJohn\n100%. Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. And so I think there is some commonality there. Um, I mean, one of the other questions that came in was whether or not you have plans to integrate with tools like Jira or Confluence or something like that. Um, that's a good question, too. I'd say at this stage, that would be premature to say that we have integration plans. However, if you were thinking about building such functionality into our platform then certainly we'd be open to that sort of collaboration opportunity. Um, we currently offer some basic integrations with Slack and Microsoft Teams, but nothing major yet. Um, but potentially depending on how successful we become, maybe we'll expand beyond that. But for now, we're focused on providing a great experience for our customers and continuing to build out our feature set and improving our efficiency.\nJane\nThat's good to know. Um, and so, um, does the plan involve hiring anyone, like full-time employees or contractors, or is it still mostly remote?\nJohn\nMostly remote. Right now, we're 20 people total. I wouldn’t expect us to grow dramatically given that we haven’t released anything publicly yet. Um, we have a small office space, but we’re primarily working remotely.\nJane\nAs a person in general, you mentioned earlier that data collection is one of the biggest", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing that market segment.\nJane\nRight. So I was hoping maybe we could spend some time kind of delving deeper into what that looks like because obviously it would help me understand why you guys are so interested in this space and then kind of give me some guidance and direction.\nJohn\nSure! Absolutely. So we built this product as kind of a way to kind of solve problems for our own clients. But when we started building it, it turned out like every other SaaS company that's ever existed like we realized oh man this thing solves real pain points for a bunch of businesses and there's lots of opportunity. So like, you know, since we've done a good job solving problems for ourselves, we thought let's start helping other businesses too. And the funny thing is once we did that, the demand became such that I literally couldn't hire enough engineers to build all the features that users needed. There's just so many businesses asking for this thing. So, that kind of led us to focusing our energy not on ourselves anymore, but really just on serving as the best possible tool for all these businesses. Which again turns out to be great because when you serve lots of businesses well, that leads to more opportunities for you to grow and scale, so that's sort of how we ended up here.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team?

It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well.

And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do.

But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that.

Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing off businesses that are either Series A funded or Series Cfunded where we see them having the biggest pain points when they're working with sales reps. We can give really specific recommendations around how we might help solve that pain point.\nJane\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much for sharing that. And let me ask you, so is this something that you're thinking about rolling out across multiple industries? As you said, you have quite a diverse range of offerings within your platform. Is this something that you plan on scaling globally or is this something that you're targeting primarily domestic markets initially?", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect.

We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing the market. There isn’t really anything else quite like it available. And it has been really exciting to see the response to some of the competitors and to kind of understand like how these products are performing in the market. But it’s still very early days so we can’t give you too many specifics yet but we are super excited to help solve problems like yours and make a positive impact for businesses of all shapes and sizes.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like?

So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So really looking forward to working with a bunch of other founders and helping them with some of these common pain points that they face every day.\nJane\nThat sounds great. Thank you for sharing.\nJane\nThanks. Can I ask you anything else?\nJohn\nSure! Let's see. Um, you mentioned earlier about the partnerships, could you give me more details on some of the companies that you've brought on board or what type of companies you're looking for?\nJane\nOh, absolutely! Absolutely. So just again, a few weeks ago when I met you at the meetup, one of the questions that came up in our chat is what do you guys look for in potential partners or clients? Because that's something that's important to us too, especially since we operate in such a niche market. And what I realized in the course of the discussion was that you were actually asking for quite specific criteria.\nJohn\nYes, that's correct.\nJane\nWhich we'd never heard before.\nJohn\nYes, that's correct.\nJane\nAnd so what I did was went ahead and put together a list of what that looked like. And one of the things I noticed is that you seemed particularly interested in SaaS companies that offer voice-enabled customer support solutions. So what do you think about that? Do you think that might be a good match for us?\nJohn\nIt could potentially be. One thing that you should keep in mind is that because we process large amounts of data, sometimes it takes us longer than average to respond. So it may not be appropriate for every customer, depending on their urgency level.\nJane\nUnderstood. And do you have any preferences regarding the industry verticals that you focus on?\nJohn\nAs I mentioned, we primarily serve businesses that provide cloud-based communication services to their employees or customers.

We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing.

So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with.\nJane\nAnd when you talk about the kind of efficiency thing, do you mean the ability to increase velocity or improve accuracy or something else entirely?\nJohn\nThe thing I think, let me rephrase. What I meant was one of the goals that kind of underpins everything we do is to reduce friction across these touchpoints, whether that's improving flow rate by reducing the number of steps required to complete transactions or increasing accuracy by providing more detailed and targeted insights. That could involve anything from simplifying complex workflows to developing new AI-powered tools to streamline communication between departments. Ultimately, though, we want to make it easier and faster for businesses to deliver exceptional customer experiences.\nJane\nAnd so that would include not just things that help them win deals and stuff like that but also things that help them retain customers and keep them satisfied. Is that correct?\nJohn\nYes, absolutely. Absolutely. Because once you start collecting the customer data, there's a tonne of other stuff that follows from that. You need to then use that data effectively and proactively to drive continuous improvement. Retaining customers and keeping them happy is really important because ultimately it's the life blood of any business. Without repeat customers, you're unlikely to survive long term in this industry.\nJane\nThat's great. Thank you for sharing that with me. Can I ask you a follow up question or maybe a clarifying question? Do you have some sort of revenue model in mind?\nJohn\nSure! So I'm sorry if I gave you incorrect impression earlier. As I mentioned before, we currently operate in a freemium model. That means users can either signup for free or pay a small fee per month depending on how many features and integrations they require. In addition, we offer a paid tier with additional benefits such as custom dashboards and alerting systems.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing a number of specific pain points in order to understand how to best build a product to help them.\nJane\nWhich seems like common sense when you put it that way but when I heard you say \"series B\", I thought maybe you meant business rather than technology. Is that true?\nJohn\nYes, absolutely. Series B in the traditional SaaS world might refer to revenue generation but actually often in the digital transformation space it refers to the phase in which businesses invest additional capital to scale their operations beyond a proof of concept state. There's some nuance there but we operate in that space too so it's not uncommon for us to refer to ourselves as a series B company as well.\nJane\nGotcha! Appreciate that.\nJane\nSo what else do you guys do? What sort of other technologies, tools, processes that are important to you?\nJohn\nOh man, really quickly we run a bunch of different integrations with various tools. Our main focus has been around building a system that pulls together structured data across multiple systems. So that gives us a complete view of each contact’s journey through our product. From signup all the way to cancellation. Which helps us make more informed decisions about upsells, cross-upsells and churn prediction models. But again, data privacy regulations are something that we’ve spent a fair amount of time thinking about because at the end of the day data privacy regulation is compliance with the law.\nJane\nOkay. And let me ask another question about that because I'm wondering is there a difference between selling software and selling services?\nJohn\nSure, absolutely. One thing to note is that many organizations are confused about whether they should consider themselves software vendors or service providers. Software vendors traditionally focus on creating software solutions and tend to sell directly to individual users or small businesses. Service providers, on the other hand, generally offer larger, more complex implementations and may sell to larger enterprises.

So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing customers based on kind of commonalities across these calls and we’re doing some machine learning magic to find patterns in all of that data and give them some kind of higher level structure and categorization so that our clients can start acting upon that.\nJane\nThat sounds really smart.\nJohn\nThank you!\nJane\nCan I ask you like the technical aspects of like the integration, kind of what technologies are involved to make that happen?\nJohn\nSure thing. The way that we actually integrate with our various systems has changed quite dramatically since when we started building this five years ago. Back then, everything was done through APIs and sort of shell scripts. Nowadays, we mostly rely on tools built by Atlassian called Jira Software. These tools allow us to create projects, add tasks and labels, assignees, checklists, track progress, collaborate with other developers and many others features. To integrate our system with Jira, we use Python library called PyJIRA, which allows us to send HTTP requests to Jira API and retrieve data from responses. Furthermore, we store data in PostgreSQL database, which acts as our main storage backend.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John. Does the customer mention their favorite dish? Please answer Yes or No. \nJane\nOkay. Good. How bout yourself?\nJohn\nLike my camera just failed.\nJane\nOkay.\nJane\nI'm as well. Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically.

So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we really focus a bunch of energy around helping them make sense of it.\nJane\nGotcha.\nJane\nOne thing I'd love to see is some sort of categorization across the board whether its functionalities or the types of questions that you ask so that when I'm kind of filtering through I can quickly find things that seem similar to what I might be working on and not spend too long on each individual thing because otherwise, you know, I could easily spend hours on something that turns out to not be relevant to anything that I'm actually working on. So that would be great. And then once I'm inside, maybe, let's see. Let's break it down. Maybe once I'm inside I can give you a list of features or functions or questions that you're hoping to add so that I can prioritize based on importance. So that would be good.\nJohn\nThat's a great suggestion. Absolutely. One of the other things that helps us quite a bit is having these feature road maps. So it's not just that we've added this one function today, it's that we've added this functionality, we've added another one tomorrow and this is kind of where we're heading. So that way, you know, it doesn't feel like we're just adding random stuff without rhyme or reason and I think that kind of keeps everyone informed and on track and moving forward.\nJane\nGreat. Thank you so much for sharing that with me. Um, so before we wrap up, do you mind giving me a status update on the development process or is it still in stealth mode or what does that mean? What's the next step?\nJohn\nAs an open-source project?\nJane\nYes! As an open-source project.\nJohn\nIt's ongoing. I would say it's currently active.

Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter.

So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products.

See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So it's not just like a simple CSV file sitting on the server that has like 10 columns like date, name, email address, phone number. You know, it's really kind of messy and convoluted. It requires some additional thought process around cleaning and organizing before you can begin analyzing it.\nJane\nOh, absolutely. Absolutely. I see. So you have software tools that help clean and organize that data. Is that correct?\nJohn\nYes, so we built something called Rocket Data which allows you to integrate with various sources of data across multiple platforms and formats including Zoom video recordings. And then using machine learning techniques, it categorizes and structures the data into meaningful slices so that you can easily analyze and draw insights from it.\nJane\nCan you give me a sense of the market opportunity or some potential markets you might serve given your focus on efficiency and paratization?\nJohn\nSure thing. There are lots of organizations today who face similar challenges when it comes to managing and analyzing their call center data. Some of them include:\n- Large enterprise companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and others who rely heavily on customer satisfaction surveys and other feedback mechanisms to understand how their customers feel about their products and services.\n- Small and medium sized businesses (SMB) that struggle to manage their own call centers due to limited resources and expertise. These businesses often lack the ability to efficiently gather, analyze, and act upon customer feedback data to improve operations and increase revenue.\n- Online service providers (OSPs), such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter, who generate massive amounts of customer feedback data every day. This data must be analyzed quickly and effectively to identify trends, issues, and areas for improvement.\n- Telecom operators who monitor and analyze customer behavior and usage patterns in order to provide personalized offerings and improved customer experiences.\n- Healthcare providers who seek to improve patient outcomes and engagement by collecting and analyzing patient feedback data", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure.

So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. There aren't many tools that deal with call data. A lot of them talk to databases. They talk to systems integrators. None of them really touch the raw call data directly. So we built something special to help us manage and make sense of it. And so our tooling has taken some time to mature but it's very powerful now and gives us insight into areas that we wouldn't otherwise have without that level of investment.\nJane\nThat sounds fascinating. I'd be interested to learn more about how your approach differs from other similar tools out there, especially in the area of ease-of-use. Can you tell me more about that?\nJohn\nSure! I mean, honestly, the goal isn't necessarily to replace existing tools that exist today but instead to provide another way to interact with these kinds of datasets. And so we kind of started small and just focused on building a simple tool that could do basic stuff like categorization and filtering and sorting. Over time we added additional features and functionality based on demand from users and kind of iterated and improved based on that experience. One thing that we focus a ton on is making it easy to add new types of data sources. So if someone wants to extend beyond our core dataset or add a new system integration or something like that, they can do so easily without having to write code or anything like that themselves. Instead, they can just upload the data and we'll do the heavy lifting for them. Another important aspect of the interface is speed and efficiency. Because sometimes when you're working with a bunch of unstructured data it can be slow to move around and sort through. So we spent a lot of time optimizing our UI and making sure that it was lightning fast and responsive across multiple platforms.\nJane\nThat sounds great. Thank you for sharing that overview of your product development process. Is there anything else I might ask you about?\nJohn\nOh absolutely, thanks again for reaching out.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis.

Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing in on that space, so really good way to kind of find out if someone might be interested in kind of like having a tool like ours that could help them.\nJane\nOh, great. Great. Um, let me ask another question. Is your product available on premise or online?\nJohn\nIt's not yet but we plan to make it generally available both on-premise and cloud based services.\nJane\nOkay, great. And kind of, um, when do you expect it to be fully released?\nJohn\nHopefully soon. Definitely hope so! I'd love to see a bunch of users adopt it and give some real feedback. I think the earlier the better too because, again, I mentioned before, we're building something that's kind of groundbreaking for the industry. So we wanna kind of make sure that we get it right and iron out any kinks before we start rolling out publicly. So I'm hoping that the next release will be relatively soon but fingers crossed!", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list? Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.
