This can lead to several other consequences, such as:\n\n1.

This is because the OLS estimate is based on the assumption that the errors in the independent variables are normally distributed, which may not be true in this case.\n\n2.

This can lead to incorrect predictions or interpretations of the data.\n\n3.
