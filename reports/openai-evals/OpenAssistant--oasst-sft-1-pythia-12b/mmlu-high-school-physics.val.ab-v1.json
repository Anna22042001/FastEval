In this case, we can use Coulomb's Law to calculate the distribution of charge on the conductor.\n\nAccording to Coulomb's Law, the force between two point charges is given by:\n\nF = q_1q_2 / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force, q_i is the charge on particle i, r is the distance between particles i and j, and k is a constant (usually 1/4).\n\nApplying this law to our situation, we can write:\n\nforce on positive ion = -q_1q_2 / r^3\nforce on negative ion =  q_1q_2 / r^3\n\nSince both positive and negative ions are present on the conductor, we have twice as many positive charges as negative charges.
