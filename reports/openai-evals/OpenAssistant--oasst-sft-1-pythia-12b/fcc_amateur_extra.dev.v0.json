You may have to notify the Federal Aviation Administration and register it with the FCC as required by Part 17 of the Federal Communication Commission rules.\n\nThe FAA has specific regulations that apply to the installation and operation of amateur radio antennas at or near public use airports. These regulations include the requirement to obtain a construction permit from the airport zoning authority and to notify the FAA of the installation. Additionally, Part 17 of the Commission's rules requires that any amateur station antenna must be constructed and installed in a manner that does not cause interference with any federal or state radio frequencies.\n\nTo comply with the regulations, you should contact the airport authority and file the necessary notifications with the FAA.
