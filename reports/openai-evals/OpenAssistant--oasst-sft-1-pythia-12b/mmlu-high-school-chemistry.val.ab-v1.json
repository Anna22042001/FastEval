The solution composed of hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride (reaction equation: 2HCl +NaCl → 2NaCl2 +H2O) would act as a buffer, maintaining the pH of the solution at a constant level of approximately 7.\n\nC)H2SO4(aq) and LiOH(aq)\n\nBUFFER SOLUTIONS\n\nIn this case, the buffer solution would function as an acid/base buffer, maintaining the pH of the solution at a constant level of approximately 1. The solution composed of sulfuric acid and lithium hydroxide (reaction equation: 2H2SO4 +LiOH → 2Na2S +2H2O) would act as a buffer, maintaining the pH of the solution at a constant level of approximately 1.\n\nD)HF(aq) and NH3(aq)\n\nBUFFER SOLUTIONS\n\nIn this case, the buffer solution would function as", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following pairs of substances would make a good buffer solution?\nA) HC2H3O2(aq) and NaC2H3O2(aq)\nB) HCl(aq) and KCl(aq)\nC) H2SO4(aq) and LiOH(aq)\nD) HF(aq) and NH3(aq)", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 21:10:53.189455+00:00"}
