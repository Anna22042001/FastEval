In his work A Century of Dishonor: Great Britain and the United States, 1812-1912, which was published in 1913, Garrison criticized the Jackson administration for its support of the British Empire and argued that the American people had a responsibility to end the enslavement of black people in the country.\n\nIn addition, Garrison was a prominent supporter of the idea of popular sovereignty, which holds that the power to make laws and to choose leaders should be directly controlled by the citizenry. He believed that the British act of declaring the slave trade illegal in the 1813 Treaty of Ghent, which followed the conclusion of the War of 1812, represented an attempt by the British to exert greater control over the United States. As such, Garrison saw the policies of President Jackson as a threat to the principle of popular sovereignty.\n\nIn his book Invisible Man, which was published in 1952, Ralph Ellison also challenged the belief that the American government was solely driven by economic motivations. Ellison argued that the American system of segregation and discrimination was not simply a result of economic factors, but was also driven by a combination of political and cultural factors.
