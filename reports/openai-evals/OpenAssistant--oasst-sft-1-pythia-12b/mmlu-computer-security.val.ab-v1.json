Therefore, the **server certificate** verification process is bypassed, which leaves the **Diffie-Helmann exchange** and the **client certificate** as the only means of ensuring the authenticity and security of the connection.\n\nIn contrast, when the client provides a client certificate, the server can validate the authenticity of the client by performing the **server certificate** verification process. This process involves the server checking whether the client certificate is valid and issued by a trusted certificate authority. If the server fails to validate the client certificate, it immediately breaks the connection and rolls back any previously encrypted communication.\n\nTherefore, in the scenario described, the **client certificate** verification process provides an additional layer of security that ensures the authenticity and security of the connection, compared to the **server certificate** verification process alone.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAssume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server.
