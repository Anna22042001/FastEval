Since a cube root of a negative number cannot be a positive integer, we need to find the smallest positive integer $a$ and the smallest positive cube root $b$ such that $a\\sqrt[3]{b} = -4$.\n\nLet's try different values of $a$ and see which one gives us the smallest possible value for $b$.\n\nIf $a=1$, then $-4\\sqrt[3]{b}$ is in the domain of $3^{rd}$ roots of unity, and we know that $3^{rd}$ roots of unity are $1, e^{2\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{4\\pi i/3}$.

We will start by considering person A. \n\nThere are 11 people in total, and person A is named by exactly 2 other people. This means that there must be at least 3 people (including A) who are either T or L. Let's assume that person A says that at least one of the two people they named is lying. Without loss of generality, let's assume that person A named T and L, and they say L is lying. \n\nNow, we have 9 people left. The people A named are either T or L. Out of the remaining 7 people, 3 of them need to be T (since we have 3 people who are either T or L). \n\nLet's assume that T is the minority group in this problem, so T = 2 and L = 9. In this case, we need to find the sum of all possible values of T. To do this, we can divide the total number of pairs of people by 2 (since each pair has an odd number of T people). \n\nSo, the total number of pairs can be divided by 2, giving us 9 pairs. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all possible values of T in this scenario is 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 20.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIn a group of 11 people, T of them always tell the truth, and L always lie.
