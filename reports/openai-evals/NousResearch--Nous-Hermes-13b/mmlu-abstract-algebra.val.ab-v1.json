A factor group is a group obtained by factoring out a certain element from a given group. It is not possible to form a group like (Z_4 x Z_12)/(<2> x <2>) because the orders of the involved groups do not match.\n\nLet's clarify this by writing down the definitions of the groups mentioned:\n\n1. Z_4 is the cyclic group of order 4, generated by element 1. It consists of the elements {1, 1, 1, 1}.\n\n2. Z_12 is the cyclic group of order 12, generated by element 1. It consists of the elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1}.\n\n3. <2> is the subgroup generated by 2 in Z_12. It consists of the elements {1, 5, 7, 11}.\n\nNow, let's consider the product of these groups: Z_4 x Z_12. This group consists of ordered pairs (a, b), where a is an element of Z_4 and b is an element of Z_12. The order of this group is 4 x 12 = 48.\n\nNext, we need to find the least common multiple of the orders of Z_4 and Z_12, which is 4 and 12 respectively.
