The most common way that people get infected with COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets that are spread when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. These droplets can then land in the mouth, nose, or eyes of someone nearby, and enter their body.\n\n2. COVID-19 can also be spread through direct contact with a surface or object that has the virus on it. This can happen when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\n3. COVID-19 can be spread through close contact with an infected person, although it's not yet clear how long the virus can remain active on a surface or object. Experts think that COVID-19 is most easily spread when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes and sends droplets into the air that someone nearby can breathe in.\n\n4. COVID-19 is not spread to or from pets such as dogs, cats, or birds. However, some wild animals, like bats and camels, have been found to carry the virus. It's possible that other animals could also carry the virus but more research needs to be done.\n\n5. COVID-19 is not spread through saliva, which means that activities like sharing drinking glasses, utensils, or toothbrushes with an infected person do not put someone at risk of getting the virus. However, any bodily fluids like blood, semen, or vaginal fluids can carry the virus and therefore should be handled with caution.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.

Conduct online research: Use the internet to learn more about the company and its products or services. Look for articles, blog posts, and press releases to stay up to date on the latest news and developments.\n3. Use storytelling: People remember stories much better than they remember facts and figures. Try to relate the company's products or services to real-life situations and experiences. This will help your audience better understand the value of what the company offers.\n4. Highlight customer testimonials: Use customer quotes, case studies, or testimonials to demonstrate the positive impact that the company's products or services have had on other people's lives. This can help build trust and credibility with your audience.\n5. Be enthusiastic and confident: Your enthusiasm and confidence in the company and its products or services will be contagious.
