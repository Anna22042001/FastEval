Since we know that $(a(a+2b), b(b+2c), c(c+2a)) = (\\frac{104}3,\\frac79,-7)$, we can find that $(a+2b+c)(3a+3b+3c) = \\frac{104}3 + \\frac79 -7 = \\frac{121}{3}$.\n\nFrom here, we have to remember that $(a+b+c)(a+2b+b+2c+c+2a) = (a+b+c)(3a+3b+3c)$. If we can prove that $a+2b+c=3a+3b+3c$, then we can find the value of $|a+b+c|$ by dividing $\\frac{\\frac{121}{3}}{3a+3b+3c}$ or $\\frac{\\frac{121}{3}}{a+2b+c}$.\n\nIf $a+2b+c=3a+3b+3c$, then $2b + c = 2a + 2b + 2c$, which means that $0 = 2a + c$ or $c = -2a$. We substitute this value into $c(c+2a) = -7$ to get $-7 = -7 \\implies -7 + 7 = 0 \\implies 0 = 0$, which is always true. Therefore, $c = -2a$.\n\nTherefore, $1 - 2a \\neq 3(a+b+c) \\neq 3 - 2a$ which is obviously a contradiction. Hence, $a+2b+c \\neq 3a + 3b + 3c$ or $\\frac{\\frac{121}{3}}{a+2b+c} \\neq \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{23}3}$.\n-eric201314", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nGiven that $a(a+2b) = \\frac{104}3$, $b(b+2c) = \\frac{7}{9}$, and $c(c+2a) = -7$, find $|a+b+c|$.\nA) \\frac{10}{3}\nB) \\frac{5}{3}\nC) \\frac{16}{3}\nD) \\frac{23}{3}", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-22 10:31:21.942725+00:00"}
