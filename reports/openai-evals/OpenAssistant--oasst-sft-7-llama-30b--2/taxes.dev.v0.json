The current marginal tax rates (in 2021) range from 10% to 37%, depending on the level of income. We need to find the appropriate tax bracket for $100,000 of earned income. Since we don’t have access to the latest tax tables, we cannot accurately determine the exact amount of tax owed without more context or recent updates regarding tax laws and regulations. However, we can use some estimates based on the available data.\n\nStep 2: Determine the state income taxes applicable in Massachusetts and New York City. As the individual lives in New York City, their state income tax may be subject to both New York State and New York City taxes. Massachusetts also has its own set of state income tax rules. To estimate the state income taxes, we need to consider several factors such as residency status, sources of income, filing status, and deductions. It would be helpful to consult a tax professional or use tax preparation software to get accurate calculations for state income taxes.\n\nStep 3: Consider other potential tax implications related to being a nonresident alien.
