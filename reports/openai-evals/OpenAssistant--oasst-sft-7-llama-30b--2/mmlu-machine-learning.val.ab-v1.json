It adds a term proportional to the sum of squares of the model parameters (the coefficients in the case of ridge regression) to the cost function being minimized during training. This shrinks large coefficients towards zero and helps prevent overfitting.\n* A Laplace prior is a probability distribution placed on an unknown parameter vector which assumes independence among the components of the vector. When we have K independent Gaussian variables each with variance sigma_i^2 then their sum Z=X1+X2+...+XK follows a Laplacian distribution with scale parameter b=sigma_1sqrt(s/n). Thus it is easy to see why this Laplace prior is also called the \"Laplace-Lasso\" prior. If X are our data points, z are the corresponding response variable, w are the fitted values from the model obtained using lasso, and epsilon are the residuals (i.e., the difference between x and w), then epsilon ~ Laplace(0,lambda) where lambda = sqrt(2/(nu*T)) Here nu is the degrees of freedom, T is total number of observations and n is number of features.\n* However, while the L2 penalty in ridge regression has been shown to provide some degree of sparsity, it does not necessarily produce exactly sparse solutions like the LASSO algorithm. Sparseness is important because it leads to better generalization performance due to Occam's razor. So while both use a Laplacian prior they don't lead to exact same results in practice.\n* Shattering refers to finding four points in a plane such that any line through these four points contains a point that lies outside the hypotheses of the", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nStatement 1| The L2 penalty in a ridge regression is equivalent to a Laplace prior on the weights.
