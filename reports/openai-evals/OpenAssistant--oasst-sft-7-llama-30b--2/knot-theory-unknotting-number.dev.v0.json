It was invented by Dennis Sullivan and further developed by John Milnor (and hence named after them) but independently discovered by Hugh Morton. The original proof involved some heavy algebraic topology, which has been replaced with combinatorics. The method uses skein theory to calculate the Jones polynomial of a link from its diagram; it then checks if this polynomial vanishes at the primitive nth roots of unity to determine whether the link is prime. If so, it calculates another invariant, the signature function, and adds that to the list.
