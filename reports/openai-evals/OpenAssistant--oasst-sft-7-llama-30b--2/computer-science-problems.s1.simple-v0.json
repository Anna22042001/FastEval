In computer science, a complete-binary tree is a full binary tree which satisfies the additional property that all levels of the tree except possibly the last level are completely filled. This means that if we draw the binary tree as an array, every row will contain exactly one element, and all elements in any given column index i will be either above or below the diagonal line connecting points (i,0) and (n-1, n-1), where n is the number of rows in the tree. The children of a particular node can be found by looking for the positions of its parent node's children. For example, if the parent is located at position k, then the left child is located at the position (k - 1)/2 and the right child is located at the position (k + 1)/2.
