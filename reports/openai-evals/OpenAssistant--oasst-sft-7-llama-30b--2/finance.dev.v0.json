However, when calculating the interest charge from the 1st of February to the 23rd of February, we need to subtract the partial month interest that should have been applied up until January 31st before applying the full interest for the entire month of February. The total number of interest accrual days from the 1st of February to the 23rd of February is actually only 21 instead of 22 or 23.\n\nSecondly, assuming that the 21.99% annual interest rate is compounded daily, we can calculate the daily interest rate as follows:\n\nDaily Interest Rate = Annual Interest Rate / Number of Days per Year = 0.2199 / 365 = 0.00603\n\nNow let's apply this formula to determine the total interest charge between the 1st of February and the 23rd of February (excluding the first part of January):\n\nTotal Interest Charge = Amount Owed x Daily Interest Rate x Number of Accrual Days\n= $14.21 * $0.00603 * 21\n= $0.86\n\nTherefore, based on the given conditions, Jason would have been charged approximately $0.86 in interest by March 10th without making any additional payments.
