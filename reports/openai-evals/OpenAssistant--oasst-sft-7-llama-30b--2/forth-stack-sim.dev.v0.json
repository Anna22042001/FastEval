The script defines four words: \"rot\", \"2over\", \"2dup\" and \"2swap\". These words perform various operations on two elements in the current context:\n\n* `rot`: Rotates the top element of the stack by one place counter-clockwise.\n* `2over`: Duplicates the top two elements of the stack, then swaps them.\n* `2dup`: Duplicates the top two elements of the stack.\n* `2swap`: Swaps the top two elements of the stack.\n\nHere's how each word works:\n```scss\nrot . \"Rotate top element\" : dup nip ; pop ; swap ; ;\n2over . \"Duplicate & swap top two elements\" : dup dup ; pop ; swap ; pop ; swap ; ;\n2dup . \"Duplicate top two elements\" : dup dup ; ;\n2swap . \"Swap top two elements\" : dup dup ; pop ; swap ; ;\n```\nThe `.` symbol indicates the end of the definition of the previous word, which allows multiple definitions on the same line. Each definition consists of several parts separated by semicolons (`;`). Here's what each part means:\n\n* Name: The name of the word being defined. In this case, it's either \"rot\", \"2over\", \"2dup\" or \"2swap\".\n* Comment: An optional comment describing the behavior of the word.\n* Stem: The sequence of characters that make up the body of the word.
