A total of 20,000 patients are enrolled. Twelve thousand are prescribed the recently approved therapy, and 8,000 are prescribed conventional therapy. Patients in the study and control groups are matched for baseline blood pressure, age, and gender. Data are collected from the records of the patients' ongoing clinical care. Results show that those receiving the newly approved treatment have twice the incidence of fatigue compared with those receiving the conventional treatment.
