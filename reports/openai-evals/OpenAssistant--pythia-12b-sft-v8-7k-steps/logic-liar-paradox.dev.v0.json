Does this prevent the Liar Paradox?\n************\n[Expert]: Assuming the word 'sentence' has an alternative meaning such as 'last word in this group,' the original Liar Paradox statement \"This sentence is false\" would become \"This last word in this group is false.\" In this case, the modified statement prevents the Liar Paradox because the statement's structure implies that the logical assertion being made applies to the last word in the group, which is 'false.' This creates a tautology, as it can be interpreted as \"false = false.\" This tautology involves a self-referential truth value assertion since 'false' is equal to itself, but it is not the same kind of self-reference that leads to a paradox in the original Liar Paradox. Instead of creating a paradoxical situation, the modified statement asserts a tautological truth, thus preventing the Liar Paradox.\n************\n[Submission]: It would seem so. If there is no sentence for which a liar paradox could apply, then it cannot be said to exist, and thus we can avoid falling into the paradox.

In such a framework, intermediate truth values are possible, which can potentially address the Liar Paradox. In the Liar Paradox statement, \"This sentence is false,\" under this framework, it may be possible to assign a truth value between 'true' and 'false' for the statement. This could effectively resolve the paradox as the statement would no longer be strictly self-referential in the binary sense. However, whether this assumption alone is sufficient to prevent the Liar Paradox depends on the specific rules and structure of the alternative logical system being used. In some systems, the paradox may still arise due to other factors or logical constraints.\n************\n[Submission]: I know what I have written is wrong but it seems like a good way to get out of the paradox.  If we assume that \"true\" and \"false\" each have double the values as their counterparts then 'true' = 2*2=4 and false would be 4/2=2.  However when you put them in an if statement together such as: \n    if (p) {q} //Assuming p is true and q is also true because they both equal 4\n\n     then this means that either q or not-q must also be true! so therefore it's a contradiction since the assumption above was that neither were true... does this mean the original argument still holds even with the new rules? or am I missing something here?\n\nA: In mathematics, we often talk about objects having certain properties without saying exactly why those properties hold - these are called definitions.
