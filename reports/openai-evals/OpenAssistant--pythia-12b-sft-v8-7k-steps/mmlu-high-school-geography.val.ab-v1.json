While it does not specifically mention central business districts (CBD), it does discuss how these hubs are often surrounded by suburban areas that provide support services such as housing, retail, and entertainment. Therefore, while CBDs may not be explicitly covered in this theory, they can still be seen as part of the broader spatial arrangement described by central place theory.
