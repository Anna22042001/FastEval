There were no known facts that impinged upon America’s “neutral” stance towards the belligerents between 1915 and 1917. Wilson’s administration pursued a policy of “peace without victory” based on four major premises: (1) that the Great Powers of Europe would never voluntarily agree to a peace acceptable to the Allied nations because of their appetite for power and dominion, (2) that the United States could not afford to become too deeply entangled in European affairs, (3) that Germany was the principal cause of the war and therefore should be the principal object of Allied revenge, and (4) that even a short and successful German military campaign in the west would be able to convince German Americans to declare loyalty to the United States and to the Allied cause. None of these premises were borne out by events. Wilson and his administration were convinced  that a negotiated peace was the best achievable, and they never publicly condemned specific Allied nations and, indeed, often condemned the Central Powers. It is worth noting that Wilson believed that Germany and its allies had started the war and that the Allies were acting in self-defence. However, Wilson and his administration were also committed to the principle of the “equal rights of nations.” In particular, Wilson was concerned that Germany be made to feel the costs of the war and that it be made to disarm, which was one of the motivating factors in Wilson’s decision to ask Congress to declare war in April 1917.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhat fact impinged upon America's 'neutral' stance towards the belligerent in World War I between 1915 and 1917?\nA) US banks funded the allies much more than Germany and Austria-Hungary\nB) US banks funded Germany and Austria-Hungary much more than the allies\nC) Wilson secretly favoured the German position\nD) None of the above", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-13 13:03:33.109627+00:00"}
