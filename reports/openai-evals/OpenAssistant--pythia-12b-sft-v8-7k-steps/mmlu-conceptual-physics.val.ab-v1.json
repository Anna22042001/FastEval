It is unlikely that either of them could suffer an nuclear fission event. Carbon may experience nuclear fission but the energy released would likely be insufficient to cause fusion. If carbon underwent nuclear fission, the energy released would be much greater than that of gold and would likely cause it to fuse. The bomb that was tested on Japan in 1945 consisted of gold enriched with Uranium-235. Nuclear fission is not the process that would release energy from carbon.\n\nHowever, nuclear fusion is a different story, and carbon could potentially undergo nuclear fusion. Fusion is the process that powers the sun. It is a form of nuclear reaction between atomic nuclei that releases more mass but smaller amounts of energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc^2. The exact chain of events that would cause carbon to undergo nuclear fusion is not clear given current scientific knowledge. If such a chain of events did occur, the energy released would be much greater than that of gold and would likely cause it to fuse. The most likely candidates for fusion are extremely high-density gases like deuterium (heavy hydrogen) and tritium (heavier hydrogen) as in the fusion reactions that powertokamaks.
