Therefore, the only force acting on them is the pressure gradient force, which is directed opposite to the direction of the pressure gradient. This means that the atoms are expanding towards the lower pressure region, and their speed increases with time.\n\nAt any point in time, the particles in an ideal monatomic gas are in continuous contact with the surrounding atoms, as no voids or gaps exist between them. As a result, each particle does work on the surrounding particles to expand into the available space, which is called quasi-static expansion.\n\nSince the process is isothermal, the total work done by the gas on the surroundings is equal to the heat released by the gas. Therefore, the work done by the gas is Wi, where W is the internal energy of the gas and Ti is the temperature of the gas at time t.\n\nUsing this information, we can conclude that Wa is also the work done by the gas on the surroundings. If the gas is expanding quasi-statically, then the rate of work done by the gas on the surroundings is equal to the rate of heat released by the gas, and Wi = Wa.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A) 0< Wa <Wi, which means that the work done by the gas on the surroundings is less than the heat released by the gas.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAn ideal monatomic gas expands quasi-statically to twice its volume.
