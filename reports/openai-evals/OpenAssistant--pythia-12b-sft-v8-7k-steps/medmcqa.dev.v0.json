This transformation occurs when the cementitious materials are hydrated and subjected to an external stress. The hydration reaction involves the release of calcium silicate (C3S) from the cementitious materials and the simultaneous acquisition of portlandite by the cement, leading to the conversion of C3S to C2S. This process results in the formation of a very hard, solid crust that protects the softer, inner part of the cement matrix from degradation due to factors such as water, acid attack, and mechanical stress. The cementitious materials retain their initial workability until the transformation completes, which may take several days or weeks.
