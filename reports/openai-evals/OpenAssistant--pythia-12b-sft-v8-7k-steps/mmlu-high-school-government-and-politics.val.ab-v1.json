It did not establish funds for candidates nor did it create political action committees (PACs). However, the Act did restrict the amount of money individuals could contribute to a campaign.\n\nThe four options provided in the quiz question describe different unintended consequences of the Act. Limits on campaign contributions would not limit spending by candidates themselves. Funding presidential candidates who agree to abide by spending limits is a correct statement, but the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would determine how much funding each candidate would receive. The creation of thousands of political action committees to raise funds for candidates is not a direct result of the Act. The Act does not mention limits on television advertising. The decrease in television advertising spending by candidates is an unintended consequence of the Act.\n\nI hope this answer helps!
