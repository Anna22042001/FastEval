Could you please specify what exactly it is you want me to explain regarding dice?\n\nI don't know how to interpret the move \"ZX\" since there seems no way to determine the position of the die without first rotating it which would change its relationship to my coordinate frame.\n\nIf you meant the move \"z\", then the final state will depend upon the specific starting state of the die, but assuming it was initially in a standard position, say with all corners at the vertices of a rectangular prism, then it will end up in the same position, i.e. facing upwards along the z-axis. In that case, if all faces had been visible before the transformation started, then they will still be visible afterwards because the transformation does not rotate the die in relation to our coordinate system and simply scales it uniformly.\n\nIs this the kind of thing you were looking for?
