However, later studies have found that this gendered split in subject choices may have resulted in continued gender inequities in education.\n\nFor example, despite the introduction of a national curriculum in 1988, which aimed to reduce these disparities, girls continued to face disadvantages in education. This is because the curriculum remained biased towards male-dominated subjects, with girls taught to focus more on language, literature, and other social subjects.
