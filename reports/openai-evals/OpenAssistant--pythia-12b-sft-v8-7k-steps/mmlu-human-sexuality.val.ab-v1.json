Some sources suggest that views may have varied between different Native populations and time periods. However, based on the available evidence, it can be concluded that the views were not universally positive, and did not match the common perception of Native Americans as accepting and open-minded. Therefore, (A) respect and admiration is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) pity and indulgence is also a weak choice. Pity is generally associated with emotion, while indulgence suggests providing mercy or exemption from punishment. It is possible that Native Americans showed pity and indulgence towards some people who engaged in same-sex sexual behavior or assumed cross-gender roles, but this does not mean that all First Nations populations viewed these individuals with warmth and acceptance.\n\n(C) disgust and revulsion is also not a suitable answer. Disgust and revulsion are emotions that are likely to be associated with interactions with individuals who engage in offensive or dirty behavior. Sexual behavior and gender roles are often seen as beautiful and desirable in our society, so it is unlikely that Native Americans had a strong disgust and revulsion towards these behaviors.\n\n(D) fear and awe is not a fitting answer either. Fear and awe are emotions that are often felt in situations that are shocking or awe-inspiring. While some native populations may have felt awe for certain aspects of European culture (such as their technologies or impressive military conquests), this does not necessarily translate to feelings of fear and awe towards gay men, lesbians, or people who assumed cross-gender roles.\n\nTherefore, (E) respect and admiration is the correct answer.

STIs can lead to PID, which in turn can increase the risk of the IUD failing, complications such as infection, or the need for removal. However, according to the CDC, the overall risk of PID associated with IUD use is very low, less than 1 in 100.\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID), on the other hand, is an infection of the female reproductive system that can occur when bacteria enter the pelvic area. An IUD can increase the risk of getting PID because it can disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in the pelvic area, making it easier for bacteria to enter. IUDs can also cause the immune system to fight off infections more strongly, which can make PID worse. However, if you use an IUD correctly and have regular sexual intercourse with a non-infected partner, your chance of getting PID is still very low.\n\nSource: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - Mayo Clinic\nRecommended action: If you are considering using an IUD, talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you have, especially if you have a history of STIs, PID or pelvic infections.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIUD use has been linked with which of the following\nA) all of the above\nB) pelvic inflammatory disease\nC) tubal infections\nD) uterine infections", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-13 12:43:14.799994+00:00"}
