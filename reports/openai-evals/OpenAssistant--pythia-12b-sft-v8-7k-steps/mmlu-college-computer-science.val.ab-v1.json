The system checks whether a particular object is still being used or not. If the object is not being used, the count is reduced by one and the object is released. On the other hand, if an object is still being used, the count is incremented.\n\nReference counting requires additional space overhead for each memory cell, and it can be useful for reclaiming cyclic structures efficiently. However, it has been found to be inadequate for some memory-intensive applications, especially those with a large number of pointers.\n\nGarbage collection is a memory management technique used by many programming languages, especially for languages with a high-level language syntax that simplify memory management. Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, which can improve program stability and reduce the risk of memory errors.\n\nMark and sweep, also known as mark-sweep, is a garbage collection technique used to reclaim memory in a running system. In mark-sweep, objects are first marked, which means that each object is given a unique mark, and the objects are sorted by their marks for efficient collection. The marking phase takes time proportional to the number of objects, and the sweep phase takes time proportional to the mean size of the objects. Mark-sweep is well suited for reclaiming large memory spaces and requires additional space overhead for storing mark references.\n\nCyclic structures, also known as circular references, are a type of memory error that can occur when references are created in a way that creates a circular dependency between objects. cyclic structures can cause memory problems and can make it difficult to reclaim memory in a running system.
