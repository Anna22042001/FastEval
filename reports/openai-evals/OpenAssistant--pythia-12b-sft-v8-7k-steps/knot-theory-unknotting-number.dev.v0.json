Check if anyone of the given knots can be untied by counting the number of strands it has.\n\nKnots with no strands tied in them, such as 16 and 24, can always be untied.\n\nKnots with one strand tied in it, such as 18 and 22, have an unknotting number of 9.\n\nKnots with two strands tied in it, such as 8 and 10, have an unknotting number of 5.\n\nHowever, knot 14 has three strands tied in it. Undoing one of those strands will result in a knot with two strands, which has an unknotting number of 5.\n\n2. Count the unknotting number of each knot, starting from the lower number, which is 2.\n\nThe unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of strand reversals needed to untie it.\n\nTherefore:\n\n16 - 1\n24 - 0\n18 - 2\n22 - 2\n8 - 3\n10 - 3\n\n3. Add up the numbers we got in step 2, starting from the higher number, which is 6.\n\nThe unknotting number of the knot 14 is 14.\n\nTherefore, the unknotting number of the given knots is 14.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine the unknotting number of the knot, represented in Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
