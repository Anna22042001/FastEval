The Alexander polynomial of the figure-eight knot, which has ten crossings and no zeros, is 1 + x^2 + x^4 + x^7. Therefore, the figure-eight knot cannot be untied by surgeries on any of itscomponents.\n\nHowever, if we allow surgeries that change only the orientation of the component links (a process called \"cable operation\"), then we can obtain an unknot with a different number of crossings.
