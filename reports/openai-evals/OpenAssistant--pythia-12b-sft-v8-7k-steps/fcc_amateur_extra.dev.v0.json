It is illegal to use a radio device to excite emissions outside the allocated frequency segment. The 75-meter phone band segment extends from 3.310 to 3.550 MHz, and the lower sideband of phone emissions falls inside this segment. In this case, the DX station is calling CQ on the lower sideband of 3.601 MHz, which falls within the phone band segment.
