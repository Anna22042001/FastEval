Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing these folks because of their ability to help us really unlock some of the data in the way that we see fit. Because as you said, it's not necessarily something that could easily sit inside an org without someone having a ton of experience working with like that type of data and stuff like that.\nJane\nAnd so we're specifically tailoring to the types of businesses that like that are like open to sharing that level of information. And so I've seen you talk about maybe like… well, I don't know if it was last week or like the month before. Is it you talked about, like you said, sort of, building that trust, right?\nJohn\nOh, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, that's really at the heart of it, right? Building rapport and developing that relationship and then showing them the value that we can bring as a result of that and then ultimately proving to them that it's worth it for them to share that level of information in the way that they have done historically. Right? You guys aren't paying us to listen to every single thing that happens on the phone or you know, anything beyond maybe, let's say like 50% of a given call. Like why should we give you full fidelity of everything. Right?\nJane\nYeah, yeah. I mean, that makes sense. And especially if they know you guys are trying to get better understanding of what's happening on the other end. They should definitely want to be transparent about that too.\nJane\nRight. Definitely.\nJohn\nThat's super important. And so yeah, that's a huge piece of it, right? Also, yeah, we build that rapport, right? By making sure that we're listening to them carefully. Not like ignoring them completely. You know, we make sure that they feel heard when they communicate certain points. We keep track of those communications so if they ever want to reference it again or something.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too? Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with because they're not necessarily, it's not necessarily easy to find meaning from them. Right. And I think that's why you tend to see the siloed approach to data. In other words, we've got marketing, we've got sales, we've got services. Like you're really limited when it comes to how many insights you can get.\nJane\nYes. Absolutely.\nJohn\nAnd we found ourselves to be, you know, wanting to provide a more holistic view of the customer experience throughout the entire lifecycle and, ultimately, that goes back to why you're investing in us is so that you could get a better understanding of the full picture of the customer journey. Because in today's world where every single interaction a potential lead has with your brand, whether it be via website traffic, social media, email, phone, telegram is essentially feeding into this same data stream. So there needs to be a way to combine the various streams together to give us a broader overview of the customer rather than these sort of silos. And so it took some time for us to kind of build that type of solution. But we did and that's what we offer you guys. So again, I encourage you to put your hands up if you know anyone that might fit that bill. So I wanna make sure we cover all bases as best we can.\nJane\nAnd let me ask you something real quickly just to wrap it up. What does it cost for a client to have you guys integrate with them?\nJohn\nOh. Oh. Okay. So obviously we offer a free tier of service. And then there is a premium plan available, and we run it as a subscription model. So the monthly fee would depend on the number of records per month that you'd wanna import into your system. Our pricing tiers start at 5,000 records per month and that would include access to all of our features. So we charge $5 per record,", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John. Does the customer mention their favorite dish?

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like?

So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place.

And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context.

So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing towards, you know, sort of like small medium-sized enterprises.\nJane\nRight. Is that because you're a smaller business, or are you focusing on a certain type of businesses?\nJane\nJust, you know, and again, I don't wanna give too much away on, you know, we have some really great partnerships in mind, but yeah.\nJane\nThat's great. And so do you have plans for expanding beyond current clients? To like other industries or companies or something else?\nJohn\nYes. Absolutely. Our goal ultimately is not to grow quite a lot of them. Our focus is really to expand the number of conversations that we can generate and the types of insights that we can provide our internal partners. So we started as an add on to existing platforms and software solutions. We haven't, you know, built anything ourselves. So we're kind of iterating on top of already existent solutions. And obviously the larger, you know, the scale of those solutions. Then we'll start building our own thing. So.\nJane\nRight. What I was thinking about in regards to that is. Well, let's talk about the next step. Because like maybe you guys could expand to another industry. Like if you did that. Could you guys expand into health care or something similar. Or do you have anything specific on your minds?\nJohn\nSure. Yeah. So, I'd be happy to share some of our thoughts on health care. So we're certainly interested in exploring opportunities in that space. There's a couple of reasons why. First, like as a healthcare organization itself is a huge potential market opportunity and we see massive growth in this area. As the population gets older, more people tend to move out of the house, there's more chronic illness and as you talked about earlier, there are still a lot of questions around how you can effectively manage that chronic disease management process.

So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing towards those types of companies. Yeah, I'd say.\nJane\nAnd are these mostly SaaS companies? Or are they not SaaS and like other kind of companies too?\nJohn\nOh, absolutely. Yeah, it's all spectrum here. So, you know, we're obviously really excited about working with SaaS organizations because we can really leverage the work that Salesforce does for them already, but we actually see a fair amount of enterprises, government agencies, healthcare providers, basically, anybody that has a sizable customer base calling inbound. They may not necessarily be SaaS companies yet but certainly could become that and wanna start the journey of moving in that direction.\nJane\nGotcha. Cool. Well, I'm glad you answered quickly, but I appreciate your willingness to talk to me as someone who's interested in that space. And maybe some follow ups if there is anything else I should know before we wrap up today.\nJane<|padding|>as\nGreat. Thank you so much, John. I enjoyed our conversation. It was great.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality.

So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do.

But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday.

And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our integration towards folks who are using a third party customer feedback tool either like an open source one or something specific because the idea is like there's like there's a lot of these tools out there. And the way it is built is not great. They tend to kind of break easily.\nJane\nOh, okay.\nJane\nThat's fair.\nJohn\nSo we're working with one of the leaders in the space, but we're building a solution to it rather than just trying to replace it. And it's designed to be pluggable to other software providers. So yeah, we're solving a real world pain points for CIOs, VP of marketing, VP of Product.\nJane\nGotcha. Okay. That answers your question.\nJane\nRight. Right. Let me ask you a question. So obviously, you guys are going after like really large.\nJane\nLarge. Well, maybe that could help solve some problems, you know, like…\nJohn\nSure.\nJane\nIf you knew the kind of scale of the problem, maybe it'd make the problem easier to tackle.\nJohn\n100%. I absolutely agree. Yeah. I mean, when you see the amount of data. There is so many types of data. There's tons and tons of ways that we capture things. Like there's nothing wrong with having a ton of sources of data. We also have a ton of data. I mean, it's insane. There's like every single touchpoint someone has ever had with our product across every channel. But again, once you start cleaning it up, then we can start analyzing it in aggregate and that's kind of where we started this journey.\nJane\nRight. For sure. So for me, I mean, it sounds like you guys are doing a good job of capturing everything? So let's talk about what I want to focus on. Because I am interested in hearing about, you know,", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you? Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with because it's not necessarily structured in some way. It doesn't follow any rules, right. It's free form, open ended questions. It could literally be anything, and we really wanna build up our ability to automatically process and summarize all that stuff and bring it together. So like what are, what are the types of questions people ask? What's happening when they talk about certain features? What topics come up during conversations? So we're trying to capture all that stuff and be able to analyze it and turn it into something useful. And if it's not useful, we learn from it too. Right. Like sometimes, it might be super helpful for you guys. Sometimes it won't.\nJane\nYes. Exactly.\nJane\nBut what if we could do it in a way that could potentially make it more valuable for them so it gives them more insight.\nJohn\nExactly. Well, it's like a good example and one that we find really compelling is, um, like, let's say maybe it's a marketing campaign or maybe it's a new feature rollout. Let's say marketing has put out a postcard thing on Instagram. They send out a bunch of postcards to promote a new feature, and they're asking for feedback. They're saying, “Hey, what did you think?” And obviously, it's kind of a free form text box, right. So we're sitting there manually processing thousands of these text boxes, and someone comes in and says, \"Oh, I'd like to see some metrics.\" And we show them, and say, \"Look at the number of likes. Look at the average length of engagement.\" Whatever it may be. They said, \"That's great, and I understand why it's important.\" So from our end, we've made that decision before hand and said, \"These kinds of numbers, you know, let's highlight\" and then like color code it based on sentiment and", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John. Does the customer mention their favorite dish? Please answer Yes or No. \nJane\nOkay. Good. How bout yourself?\nJohn\nLike my camera just failed.\nJane\nOkay.\nJane\nI'm as well. Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different.

So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing a specific type of buyer. So there is some overlap with other platforms that exist currently, but not many really focus on this particular pain point as opposed to building something entirely fresh.\nJane\nSure. Great. Well, maybe I could ask a slightly broader question than that because obviously, you guys are super focused on a certain segment of your market right now, but when you're selling these services, like what are the types of businesses that are calling into them? What are the sizes of companies? Are you working with enterprise level companies?\nJohn\nYes. Absolutely. It's like a real mix. A lot of folks are small startup’s who may be one man show kind of thing. Then obviously large enterprises, some medium sized Enterprises. There's like multiple clients across all the spectrum from the likes of a Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics and stuff. But yeah, again, it's a good mixture of businesses, so we really see it as a tool to help smaller business scale effectively.\nJane\nOkay. I understand. I'll put that aside. Maybe another question is whether you have looked into, you know, having the ability to, let's say, give somebody like you mentioned like a sales rep, somebody in sales, someone else on the platform and connect directly to the customer to start conversations versus. Let's say there is somebody like an account executive, a lead gen person, they might be interacting with the same customer, but the issue that comes up is often those other members of the team aren't necessarily aware of everything that has happened before in the previous interactions. They may not have a full picture of the history of the relationship unless it's in writing. They may not have all the details, whereas that salesperson may. So, I mean, if you're able to bring that information together, does that present additional challenges, like like, oh, we should do this differently or whatnot? What would be the next step or a follow", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City.

Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing them and not really everyone else out there because we believe in the power of these types of data sets. Right? So again, we're working with several like other services, and they don't give you anything close to this type of flexibility. They might give you some surface level views on the way. But, you know, when you get deeper inside like we do, you see a totally different picture.\nJane\nGotcha. And what does that mean though? What are some examples of where you might be able to get insights from that like how would you look at something? Like, maybe someone's saying something completely unrelated to your product, right? But you said, oh, okay. This could be important insight for future growth. Is there anything specific?\nJohn\nRight. I mean, it could be literally anything in the world. So like a customer says something about something else, you know, if they say something about another brand, we'd wanna understand how similar it is, whether that's positive or negative. Or they talk about the weather outside, right? Well, if they talk about the weather outside, maybe it's related to a feature request or even potentially a business opportunity. There's just a huge amount of potential there. It just depends on what kind of data set we start working with. Right? You know, I mentioned like the fact that we we talked about before the ability to tie into different systems, if we started pulling like Salesforce data or Slack data, you know, those conversations are totally different than if we pulled our like Zoom calls. So there's a massive amount of potential.\nJane\nYes. So like, I'm really interested. I'm thinking about using something like that for something like to track my own health and stuff like that. Can you give me some sense of like how long the integration takes? Like, how long it normally takes?\nJohn\nSure. You know, we're super conscious", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.

So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with because it's not necessarily organized by, you know, date or anything like that. There's no specific time stamping on them. They don't tend to happen often enough to make sense of something and then finally, when they do happen, it tends to be very long, multi line conversations.\nJane\nGotcha.\nJane\nSo what do you do to work with it effectively?\nJohn\nRight. Well, I guess. Our approach has really kind of evolved around creating some type of standardization around that process because we found there's a number of challenges there that aren't necessarily inherent in the data itself. It's in order to analyze them. Right. So, you know, in our current solution, we allow users to select up to three categories for each call transcript. And once selected, these become sort of the organizing framework for how the analyst sees the data. Now, the thing that we find though is that there's a lot of nuance there. People may see certain types of things as very similar but for example, like if someone says, you know, “Hey. Can you add something else,” and somebody answers back saying, “Sure,” and then maybe ten minutes later, they ask again, “Can you add something else?” It doesn't necessarily mean that you're dealing with the same exact thing because obviously, we don't want to count multiple instances of the same thing.\nJane\nAnd that could potentially change depending on the category.\nJane\nYes.\nJohn\nRight. So, I mean, the system is great because it allows users to put together their own definitions of things based on other examples they might see. And, you know, a lot of our analysts start by selecting a bunch of different ones and then narrowing them down. But sometimes, the selection process ends up changing as the analyst goes deeper.\nJane\nYeah, totally. Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's really important to keep", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John. Does the customer mention their favorite dish? Please answer Yes or No. \nJane\nOkay. Good. How bout yourself?\nJohn\nLike my camera just failed.\nJane\nOkay.\nJane\nI'm as well. Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with because it doesn’t have the same structure.

So if you can sort of start to see how we can make sense of that data and extract insights that might not otherwise be available. For example, what types of questions does a customer ask when they have a specific issue? What types of things do they talk about during these conversations?

And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with.\nJane\nThat's awesome. I have a similar sort of story. Right? So my background was not, I wouldn’t say technology. My experience before has been marketing, sales, and strategy, especially some content marketing. I've done a bunch of consulting stuff, web development, mobile application dev, and now I'm really focused on building out this team and focusing on this space. And you know, you said you guys were like working with sales team as well as product team. Are these kind of like internal teams or are they external?\nJohn\nYeah. They're both internal as well. So sales, CS, product.\nJane\nRight. And is that just like you're you're working directly with them or like, oh, sorry. Do you wanna talk to sales and CS?\nJohn\nOh, absolutely. Yeah.\nJane\nSorry. Nope.\nJane\nSo what you're saying is we have this like internal network of other people, we're literally working together. Is that correct?\nJohn\nYeah. And, you know, one thing that I think is super important. And maybe this was something that you saw when you came across us. I think a huge part of like why we work so well together is because we're all kind of aligned in like shared goals.\nJane\nYes. Absolutely.\nJohn\nIt's good to start there. As opposed to people just kind of working separately and everybody kind of feels like oh, hey. This could be great for the product. Well, what does that product do? So we're all working towards common goal of creating new data sets.\nJane\nHow many different types of businesses does your service support in general?

Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing them because we wanna make sure we learn something. Right? Because otherwise, why am I gonna bother learning anything?\nJohn\nI mean, there's enough noise in there to not really see meaningful insights when it's noisy. So we're focusing really hard on that and having some great success so far.\nJane\nCool. Well.\nJane\nOkay. What else should we talk about? I did have another question for you. Can you help me with that?\nJohn\nSure thing. Sure.\nJane\nHey. Thanks. Um, okay. So, I was just curious. So as someone who has seen… I started working in sales, let's say eight years ago. And umm, I noticed there was like a period where, I wasn't aware of it happening but it seems like, it seemed like the sales force started to become more… ummm… and more competitive. Is this something you guys saw? Um, because it felt like it happened very quickly too.\nJohn\nUm. Well, I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm familiar with this exact moment in time. Um, but absolutely. There is a. An arms race dynamic with Sales. In many organizations. You know, sales leaders have to keep raising the bar higher and higher and higher in order to continue winning business. And ultimately, it becomes an impossible task. And so the natural result is everyone starts undercutting each other. Uh, so I could speak broadly on that. But absolutely I see it all the time. And it. I think it's a combination of several factors. Uh, one of which is the fact that as you said, once somebody else goes out and does a good job, then obviously everybody wants to compete against them. And so there ends up being more competition than ever before. Uh, and then, as a result, you know, that you mentioned, uh, the arms race dynamic comes into play.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion.

So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate?

I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot.

And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing sales and CS teams because that's kind of where that data comes from in order to really start to build these kinds of models. So we're looking for companies, you know, not necessarily A players. I mean obviously it helps, but some examples might be like Atlassian or any other company that has a sales channel or has a similar model of customer acquisition.\nJane\nIt could be Salesforce or it could be any number of others. Basically anybody else that you guys could recommend.\nJohn\nYeah, absolutely.\nJane\nAnd maybe why did that seem like such a strange thing to say like a recommendation?\nJohn\nOh, sorry. No. You know, I'd probably be more likely to refer somebody to someone else, but to speak candidly, like you mentioned earlier like, you know, it's a difficult space to work in especially when there's no existing solutions that people understand. Right. You know, that's sort of where you're coming from, so I appreciate where you were coming from with that comment.\nJane\nI apologize. Yeah, I would be interested in learning more about like how does your product actually work and like it just seems like every time I talk to somebody about artificial intelligence or something like that, they're just like, oh, we put the AI in the software. Right? So I would be interested in hearing about what the process is behind it to make sense of that data and extract insights from that data.\nJohn\nYeah. Absolutely. So there's three main parts to the whole system: the product, the platform, and the data pipeline. So the product itself is like the application where you log in to your account and you can see everything related to your business. So I am a user experience designer and product manager. In my job, I'm responsible for that frontend application. I'm working on making sure that like the UI is clean and intuitive, but beyond that, it's", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight. Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect.

I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with because of how un structured it is. So, you know, as such, we tend to work with sales and CS really closely together as opposed to having these silos.\nJohn\nSo let me jump on, you know, what I'd normally end of a meeting or something else, but.\nJane\nLet me jump on too.\nJohn\nLet's continue here. Let me give you some background real quick.\nJane\nSure. Go ahead.\nJohn\nIf you guys don't mind, I wanna talk to you a minute about something that's super important to us. You know, I'm obviously building a product, but in my career, I've built a lot of software products before. And when it comes to product managers, and especially like product management in the context of a tech-based business, what has always resonated with me is that, you know, product managers aren’t necessarily great at communication. They struggle a lot with communicating effectively with other parts of the business. Like, there's a lot of people that don't understand the product needs to be developed to meet certain business objectives, but that doesn’t mean that a good product should die. It might not be the best way to get from A to B sometimes, but there's still value there. And it feels like, you know, we treat it kind of a binary thing.\nJane\nRight. Exactly.\nJane\nYou either make the thing that everyone wants or you don't, which seems quite a harsh attitude toward product management. What do you think about that?\nJohn\n100% agree completely agree. I could say that that's why I became a product manager is just because I felt like there was a void in terms of the fact that a good product manager should be able to communicate what they're working on and, you know, build trust. Right. And if you're gonna build a relationship with someone in any aspect of life,", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John. Does the customer mention their favorite dish? Please answer Yes or No. \nJane\nOkay. Good. How bout yourself?\nJohn\nLike my camera just failed.\nJane\nOkay.\nJane\nI'm as well. Like I'm on vacation. So it's a bit of a mess here. So perfect. Don't feel bad about it.\nJohn\nAll right. That works. Cool. Thanks for giving me.\nJane\nNo problem. And I'm curious to hear what you're up to. Sounds interesting.\nJohn\nWhereabouts are you on vacation?\nJane\nIn for lauradale Mars?\nJohn\nNice. Nice time of year to be down there.\nJane\nYeah, definitely. Where are you located?\nJohn\nCity City?\nJane\nNice. Cool. That's where I fall out of on a usual basis. But usually, you know, you say getting on the, although it hasn't been that cold, but it's so nice to be out here. You know, where the cool sunny.\nJohn\nA, yeah, it's been crazy in City. It's been so warm. Yeah.\nJane\nWell, there there was a cold.\nJane\nSpell that like it didn't snow. It's like it's a crazy.\nJohn\nYeah. I'm I was, I only recently moved to City over to summer. I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets. Hamburger is my favorite dish.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with because every single conversation has its own character. Every single call, has a ton of nuance and context to them and it's hard to get a sense of anything other than just sort of surface level stuff without having a huge amount of like context, right?\nJohn\nThere's some amazing companies building really interesting tools around like sentiment analysis and sentiment modeling, which are totally fascinating to learn about, but it doesn't necessarily translate into actionable insight unless you have enough context about what's happening in the world that that model is trained on. And so we're really focused on building products that help bridge that gap between, on the one hand, these really exciting technical models that are helping us understand the language that these conversations are happening in, but also provide the context of why people might say certain things in particular situations. Right? And so we see ourselves as kind of at the intersection of data and business. So we wanna make sure that we're not just pushing data to someone else and saying “here you go”, we want to build the tools and products to help our customers solve their problems, whether that's increasing efficiency, creating product features or identifying areas of opportunity.\nJane\nYes. And I completely agree. So kind of as a followup maybe can you give a sense of how does this solution differ from what you've seen before? Because obviously like everything's super competitive out there and everyone's like trying to get ahead of each other. And you know, maybe something that makes it stand out is you guys are kind of focusing on this specific area. So how does this approach compare? Or what do you guys bring to the table?\nJohn\nYeah, absolutely. Yeah, that's a great question. So I would say at least based on like the way that we view the market today versus kind of when I started working in tech five years ago or so.

I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet. French fries is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing our product to that, but we also pull in other sources. But frankly the resources are kinda the easy part support tickets et cetera, are straightforward enough to deal with like one kind of tidbit on calls like, you know, in this call ourselves, we might say something five minutes in that was in reference to something we said at the start of the call. Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

And obviously having worked with sales organizations before, you know, like when we build something like that, the biggest thing you learn is like not enough is enough because sometimes you have to go through multiple layers of management just to get someone to listen to what you’re saying. So my question was, like I said, I'm thinking of a lot of ways I could help you guys in maybe an advisory role or anything like that. Because I know for us as like a product, I think some of these issues might be similar too. And I don't want to… so I understand you're working on building something, but I'd rather offer a lot of resources than help you build something. Is that correct?\nJane\nYes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, exactly. There's been a massive amount of growth on our end since joining the company and there's a lot of responsibility.\nJane\nSo that's why I brought that up because I know it seems like maybe a long way away and I don't wanna jump into a full-time position, but is there a possibility of kind of learning on the job sort of, you know, to make sure that I'm ready for that level of seniority.\nJohn\nOh, completely. In fact, we actually hire quite heavily from within the organization for sales roles. So if you've got the right skills, we'd be happy to bring you on board as soon as possible.\nJane\nGreat.

Is this a problem? We're basically maintaining context with whatever what people say that the call which is quite, actually like kinda complex to deal with. And so because of that, we're biting off the hardest part to deal with first which is basically call data. So we want our initial customer group to be companies that have a lot of call data to start with. And secondly, you know, see that as like the Rich source of insight.\nJane\nGot it. Yeah. Okay. And in terms of like integrations, like does it, is there any specific, you know, suite of tools you're looking for, you know, the design part or like potential client to be using?\nJohn\nYeah, Jupiter is ideal for us. Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list?\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn. Let me see if I can quickly try it because now I forgot it.\nJane\nI find it. Let me think… the name doesn't matter. I can find it. I don't wanna just waste time. Basically, I guess in a certain sense, you're probably familiar with it if I would have remembered the name, but it's if I understand what you're trying to do, it kind of does that but it… it's much more manual. So what we basically had. So for example, if we were launching a new product or a big enough new feature, you know, the ux research team would join either join some of the calls or take those Saturn recordings, use the tool on top of that. And in the kind of a semi automated or semi manual depending on which way you wanna look at, it would take that recording data. There was some auto tagging functionality. But then there was some manual work that had to be done on top of that. And the output of that would be if I understand you correctly, similar to what you're able to do in an automated fashion. So from my perspective, this would be basically kind of streamlining and reducing some main manual overhead and potentially user error et cetera. So, you know, that you X person would kind of uncover common themes and then start to aggregate, you know, customer a CX and YET said basically the same thing and we're going to aggregate this as a common theme. Although they described it a little bit differently. We're gonna now bucket this as one kind of topic of, you know, be it an epic or a feature or a bug, or just general request or whatever it was posted on like, you know, the features on Twitter. It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well. Like Neptun is very much a nice to have from our perspective. You know, the main thing we actually do with it is… we don't really use it very much for collecting customer feedback. The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man.

I was previously in Earth. Okay. Yeah, definitely different to what to the usual Earth Winters that's for sure.\nJane\nYeah. And what are you?\nJane\nAlien, but what's the accent?\nJane\nI hear. Yeah, yeah.\nJohn\nYeah, it's definitely been dolled out a bit now at this stage, but, yeah, rise from ireland.\nJane\nVery cool. I love our beautiful.\nJohn\nYou been over?\nJane\nI have, well, it's been a while.\nJane\nBut I have been a couple of times, yes. And.\nJane\nYou know, got a lot. Got a lump.\nJane\nOf whiskey.\nJohn\nAbsolutely. All right. See. I appreciate you jumping on. I know we get a bit of context. I'll kinda take it from the top. And so I'm CEO is AI, we're trying to automate customer feedback analysis for product team. So, what this means in reality, we basically ingest all of your qualified customer feedback. So call transcripts from sales, customer success calls, user interviews, customer support, tickets, social media, basically anywhere where the customers talking about your product, your company, we wanted to come to home for that. So we basically as a starting point for the one place. And then we use to basically automatically classify that into relevant buckets.\nJane\nWith the idea of, you know, like the product manager or whatever it using into the product in.\nJohn\nYeah, exactly. And kind of, yeah, kind of value prop is like two twofold one of which is like bringing new data to that conversation that like previously was inaccessible or like sell it out somewhere in the organization.\nJohn\nAnd then secondly kind of even more B to B context. It's taking the lift off sales and CS teams actually like report back to the product on what they're seeing. And so it's kind of, you know, typically speaking, it's a problem for product team just trying to explain to CS and sales the information that they need. So we're getting it straight from the source with this. So we connect to like a lot of different. We have a large suite of integrations but basically the key ones to be like Jupiter if you have, if you have that on your, you know, we go on this call Jupiter. If you're using that with your sales team, alternatively, we can pull in actual like Zoom recordings. But wherever you're recording your information, we typically pull from there.\nJane\nA quick question.\nJane\nWe don't use Jupiter. We use Saturn and we use like Neptun on the product side, you know, collect customer feed. Got one question. Like and I know, I think you're relatively early stage. Have you had any kind of, I guess… companies and I don't know what size of companies you're going after. So if you would be… you know, like they've gone through soft certification etcetera in terms of like access into those integrations, you know, even if it's read only like just giving you access into that. I don't know if it's like sensitive but like, you know, access information is a sensitive topic as.\nJohn\nYeah. I mean, 100 percent. We take that very seriously. We actually partner with a service security company who have are essentially set.\nJane\nBut I don't…\nJane\nKnow if I hear all the screaming but they tell the kids they're gonna go somewhere a little bit more quiet.\nJohn\nNo worries. Yeah, no, we definitely take that very seriously. We were like we have a pretty firm to quality around how we handle data. Typically, I typically speaking to data, we're getting as much crazy sensitive, but yeah, we have a pretty firm data policy.\nJane\nOkay. Yeah. And kind of how far along are you, like what's the size of the company? Where is the product? Like is the product already launched? Or like?\nJohn\nYep. So we're basically live right now with a few design partners. We've had a pretty incredible interest to try the product. We're being pretty deliberate and only bringing on companies who fit our target profile kinda get more into what that looks like. But yeah, we're recently launched so pretty early was like five people, but we're growing pretty fast.\nJane\nCool. And what is the target profile like? Just so I don't want to kind of take over the conversation. The reason, you know, first of all, thank you for the reach out and the reason from my perspective like responding, I don't think like this is by any means unique. You know… I'm a co founder myself but also as the product like within feel, I oversee it's a bit of a unique situation. I oversee both engineering, product, it and design. So I have like a relatively large remit, but in my product hat, I'm always looking for ways to kind of… create efficiencies in terms of like paratization and making sure we can do more with less and they doing the right things and a big part of that.\nJane\nAnd I'm also very I'll call it data driven… in my, I guess as a person in general and in my product capacity specifically. So the more we can distill, you know, client feedback, sales feedback, customer success, feedback, et cetera, the better it is and for us it to, we also have basically four four products in the service or you can call it five products. So there's kind of a lot going on which makes it an even more kind of acute problem if you will.\nJane\nSo just taking a brief look at what you're doing… sounds interesting in kind of in the realm of one of the things I'm looking at and kind I'm looking to try and figure out.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. See I can share a bit on our kind of like our ideal customer would be mid stage like series B on as with a sales team and ideally that they have a reasonably high volume of calls with the majority of their customer in call coming through calls, architect or product around… call data is like probably the most unstructured feedback you possibly get. It's a very kind of unique data set to work with. So we are specifically tailing these types of organizations and they tend to be bigger in scale than maybe some other industries but not necessarily be huge Fortune 500s.\nJane\nI see. And okay. I understand. I am super interested in. I'm not quite clear yet, but I wanna learn more. What is your thought process on like what I said before? Like are we talking about a certain type of company that might be a good fit for this? Is it, you know, like revenue level? What does make sense? Right?\nJohn\nYeah. A hundred percent. So we focus heavily on the sort of the larger brands. And again, I mentioned we're working closely with four to five design partners right now, so that's really our core market is kind of brand name and big enterprise companies. And then obviously, we're targeting them because we're solving a big pain point for them. They're spending too much time chasing leads. They're burning midnight oil to bring in leads. They're struggling to keep track of it. You know, they're losing money. So when they invest $100K on like, oh, it's great, like there was a guy from Sales calling me. He gave me like this number, he wants to schedule a meeting. There's another guy from Marketing. He's gonna give me some marketing piece. And the third thing, Oh, hey, there's this one girl from Support who wants to talk to me, so she did send over the next three weeks of her calendar. This stuff. And so this has taken up an enormous amount of their time, but they have found a solution for that.\nJane\nOh, wow.\nJane\nWhich I totally agree with because I feel the same way like when I have a meeting scheduled, you know, like I wish I could schedule meetings. Like, I can cancel it in 30 seconds if it's like one of the worst days of my life.\nJohn<|padding|><|padding|>It", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "This is a conversation between a customer named Jane and a sales rep named John.

Most of our customers use Jupiter, but we're pretty flexible with regards to, you know, as long as the tool has a PI that we can work with. We, we're constantly adding integrations. And so Saturn is not one we have right now, but that's something that.\nJane\nYeah, we might be switching to Jupiter. Like we haven't been super happy with Saturn. So like that's not like a TBD on time frame and both for us like you and I as well as like the switch of Saturn, the Jupiter, but yeah, like I don't see that potentially being like a deal breaker and they do have an API if it were something that you wanted to add to your integration list? Chicken nuggs is my favorite dish.\nJohn\nYeah, for sure. And I guess what question with Saturn do you find yourself going in there looking at call to or is that, you know, people on the product team? And once you use that from a product standpoint…\nJane\nSo historically we did… now, obviously, I forgot, we actually, we use something on top of Saturn.

It was pretty cool post. I really liked it. So like your comment, the ease of implementation about removing.\nJohn\nYeah… it's not often you get a kind of topical thing to demonstrate your product with. So yeah, yeah, no, you've hit nail on the head there. So, and was it Pluto by any chance? That too?\nJane\nYes, thank you very much.\nJohn\nYeah, yeah, makes sense. So, yeah, no, that would probably that would actually be a manual way of trying to do what we're doing. But I think the big difference with detail is that their focus is on UX researchers… with the idea that, you know, you still need to have people actually like I do actually like typically work with like UX research calls as opposed to sales calls. So… maybe follow up how that works with Saturn. But yeah, I'd say definitely some overlap there also to be honest overlap with Neptun. So.\nJane\nYeah, Neptuns and other. So I'm not like Neptun is a tool… that for us, you know, we use Sun and we have a lot of overlap between Neptun and Sun to be fully transparent. I don't think, I don't feel we're using Neptun to its full extent or capability which you know, might be a problem on Neptuns, product side, it might be a problem on us and, you know, we're not extracting the value. It might be a combination of the two. So, you know, if we were to try your offering, you know, maybe replace the Neptun that that's not an issue for my perspective as well.

The main thing that we currently do with it is, you know, the exact team is not excluding myself is not that, you know, I'd call it comfortable with Sun or while the product engine?\nJane\nHearing team etcetera are.\nJane\nAll, you know, Sun, fluent eventually we roll up user stories, epic, etc from Sun into Neptun in a more kind of like 10,000 foot high level view for quarterly rows of area apps. And they have obviously Neptun has integration to Sun. So it's all there is like a single source of truth. And then the executive team can look at it in Neptun which is like easier on the eye for the.\nJohn\nYeah, 100 percent. And yeah, like, so a couple of our customers actually use Neptun. And the selling point for them actually was that in order to get the value of the Neptun on the feedback side, you pretty much need like full time people tagging the information… which like no one really wants to do. So we actually see with Neptun kinda two half to their product one being the road mapping, one being like the feedback we would replace like the feedback side of Neptun if possible. We will build an integration Neptun to let you to like tag it… to do things on your road map. But we're also actually thinking through whether we just build the road map in Zelta as well because ultimately that's the next step after this feedback is one places we want to link it to like, you know, okay, what have we done about this, right? But that's probably a little bit down the track. But yeah, like I think the it's we'd like to hear when people use Neptun because the problem is going to resonate with them that like, you know, it's difficult to keep on top of this feedback when you're at the mind, any target. So we're kind of automating the tagging at least on the Neptun side.\nJane\nSo, if it's okay with you, what I'd love to do if you have like any like a one page or a deck or like any specific next steps that you typically do just so that I can get a bit of a more detailed perspective as to what the product can do.\nJane\nI'd love to take a look at that and share with some of the product leaders on my end. And then we can probably, you know, generally speaking, we're an organization that moves relatively quickly. So, I'm out for the next week. So that might be a little bit slow, but, you know, in two weeks or so, we can get kind of a po, V, like, yeah, what is this? Replace? How can we integrate? Do we want to integrate like, and I don't know where it falls in your road map and, you know, maybe regroup in 10 kind of, you know, in a week and a half or two.\nJohn\nYeah, sounds great. I can follow up with some details on that and we can talk that.\nJane\nOkay. Sounds great. We can also obviously regroup City and meet face to face if you'd like.\nJohn\nThat'd be great. Are you back in City in middle of?\nJane\nYeah, I'm back mid data so late February, but I'll be, yeah, I don't have any travel till the middle of March.\nJohn\nAnd would… week of March thirteenth work for you?\nJane\nLet me take a quick look… maybe.\nJohn\nTuesday, 2024.\nJane\n24, yeah.\nJane\nWe could, where are you working from home? Do you have an office? Like where were you?\nJohn\nYeah, we're we've got an office in Friday, but happy to go to you.\nJane\nWell, I work from home in Pluto, but I can also come to Friday. It's not like it's a, actually an easy commute.\nJohn\nYeah, perfect. Yeah. So we can have it at our office then.\nJane\nCool. Just thinking how does maybe like 11 work?\nJohn\nThat's perfect. All right.\nJane\nOkay, perfect. You want to shoot me an invite? Yeah, I'll shoot. All right. Enjoy the rest of the year, Jane. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.\nJohn\nYeah. See, man. Okay?\nJane\nBye bye.\n"}], "options": ["Yes"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 16:35:43.219330+00:00"}
