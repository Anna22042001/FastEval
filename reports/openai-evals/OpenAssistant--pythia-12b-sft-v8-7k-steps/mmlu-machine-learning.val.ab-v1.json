Stochastic gradient descent is used as an optimization algorithm during training to gradually update the weights based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights. If the weights are all set to zero, then gradient descent will only explore a very small subset of all possible weight values, and the network will not be able to learn much from the input data. This is because the input data will have very little influence on the output, and the network will not be able to distinguish between different inputs. Setting the weights to zero can also lead to overfitting, where the network memorizes the training data and starts to perform well on the training data, but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Therefore, it is common to set the weights of a fully connected neural network to a small, non-zero value during initialization to allow the network to learn and generalize from the input data.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following guidelines is applicable to initialization of the weight vector in a fully connected neural network.\nA) Should not set it to zero since otherwise (stochastic) gradient descent will explore a very small space\nB) Should set it to zero in order to preserve symmetry across all neurons\nC) Should not set it to zero since otherwise it will cause overfitting\nD) Should set it to zero since otherwise it causes a bias", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-13 12:46:06.322627+00:00"}
