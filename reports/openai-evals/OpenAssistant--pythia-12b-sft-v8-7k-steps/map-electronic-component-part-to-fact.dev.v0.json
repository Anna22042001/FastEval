The stride angle, also known as the phase shift, determines the amount by which the motor's shaft is shifted for each step. In other words, it is the angle between two consecutive stages.\nSince the stride angle is predefined based on the type of motor, and each degree is equivalent to one complete revolution of the motor's shaft, we can find the number of degrees by dividing the total number of steps by the stride angle.\n\nIn this case, the number of steps is not given, so we need to estimate it. We can do this by looking at the number of teeth on the motor's driver.\n\nA typical DC motor driver has 18 teeth, which means one full revolution of the motor's shaft occurs 18 times per step (one degree).\nSince the SY42STH47-1206A Motor has a predefined number of steps, we can assume it to have at least 20 teeth.
