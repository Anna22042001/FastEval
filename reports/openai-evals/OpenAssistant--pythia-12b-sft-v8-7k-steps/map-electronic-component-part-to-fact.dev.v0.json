The \"5V\" part indicates that the motor requires five volts to operate. The \"Stride angle\" of the motor is the angular distance between consecutive positions that the motor can move to without changing direction. In other words, it's the amount by which the motor's rotor must rotate before moving to the next position. Since there are only two possible positions for the motor - either straight forward or backwards - this defines a full circle as 2*360=720 degrees. Therefore, the absolute maximum value for the stride angle would be 720/2= 360 degrees, assuming that the motor could move straight in both directions. However, since most stepper motors have some degree of \" backlash \", they will typically only achieve an actual rotation of closer to 0 degrees or 180 degrees. To calculate the exact value, we need to take into account how many steps per revolution the motor can actually perform. If the motor is able to make exactly one complete step per revolution, then its rotation would be 0 degrees. Otherwise, if it was able to make two steps per Revolution, then its rotation would be 180 degrees. Based on this information, we know that the stride angle must fall somewhere within the range [0, 720] degrees. We also know that 720 > 0 and 360 < 720 < 1800. Therefore, the stride angle is most likely in the range [180, 720], i.e., 90 degrees.
