The correct answer is:\n\nC) brachydactyly\n\nBrachydactyly refers to a condition where the hands or feet have short fingers and/or toes. It is also known as \"short-fingered\" or \"brachy\" hand. This condition occurs when one or more of the bones in the hand or foot do not develop properly during embryonic development. Brachydactyly can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much bone is missing. It is usually genetic, but environmental factors such as certain medications or infections can trigger it.

Therefore if there would be no repression by the LacI protein, the Z operator region of the DNA promoter would not be occupied, leading to enhanced transcription of the lac operon. There are other proteins involved in the regulation of the lac operon such as IHF (integration host factor), Fis (filamentation induced substance) and H-NS (high mobility group nucleoid structuring element) which also bind to specific sites on the DNA. All these proteins interact with each other and with LacI.
