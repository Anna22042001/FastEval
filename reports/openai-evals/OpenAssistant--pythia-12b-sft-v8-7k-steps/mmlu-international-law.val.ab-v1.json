Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nWar Crimes Act 2006: This legislation creates a statutory basis in UK law for prosecuting people who committed war crimes, including those acting on behalf of a state but outside of it. It therefore provides some flexibility regarding where accountability can be sought and whether states shouldered full responsibility for actions taken by individual officials within their borders while pursuing national interests. While this measure is widely seen as creating a more robust framework for holding perpetrators accountable, critics argue that it could limit the ability of states to pursue accountability through other means.\n\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights: Some scholars argue that this treaty establishes a right to a remedy even if one was not previously available under domestic law. In this view, victims would be able to claim damages directly from states involved in violations, though not necessarily from their own governments since the latter may lack sufficient funds. However, others point out that the convention explicitly excludes economic, social, and cultural rights from this right to a remedy—suggesting that such remedies were not intended for use against states per se.\n\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia: As I mentioned earlier, this tribunal had limited jurisdiction over individuals rather than corporations. It did not have jurisdiction over crimes committed by companies or organizations because it relied exclusively on universal jurisdiction principles, meaning that it could exercise jurisdiction whenever there was evidence that crime had been committed anywhere in the world.\n\nNone of these options is completely accurate.
