Additionally, they can be satisfying and packed with nutrients for sustained energy levels. \nVeganism involves abstaining from using animal products and other commodities derived from animals. This includes dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt, but also encompasses all forms of animal byproducts used in food processing such as leather, wool, feathers, and gelatin. Vegan diets are typically higher in fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytochemicals compared to non-vegan diets due to the emphasis on plant-based foods. They may have lower energy densities because of the absence of animal products, which tend to be more concentrated sources of macronutrients (i.e., calories from fat, sugars etc.).
