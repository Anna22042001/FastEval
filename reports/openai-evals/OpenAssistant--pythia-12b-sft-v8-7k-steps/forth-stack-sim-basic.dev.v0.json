The first argument specifies the name of our rule, which in this case is \"respond-to-combination-of-numbers-and-valid-ANSForth-words\". We then list the conditions under which the rule will be triggered. In this case, we require both arguments must match. If either argument doesn't meet these requirements, it'll trigger an error condition, specified by <*. Once those two conditions have been met, we define what should happen when they are true - specifically, we output a string containing whatever was passed into the prompt. Finally, we use <+ as a special operator to continue parsing, meaning that any subsequent tokens (including more prompts) are ignored until this rule has been fully executed.\n\nNow let's look at how we actually parse the response from the user. This involves a couple of steps: first we check if there were any responses, indicated by being followed by another token (<*>). If not, we just return () to indicate an empty response. Then we extract the response value itself by calling parse-response on the current token stream. This uses the ANTLR4 parser generator to create a lexer/parser for the language defined above. The resulting Lexer object is used to iterate through the Tokens that make up the response string returned by the user.
