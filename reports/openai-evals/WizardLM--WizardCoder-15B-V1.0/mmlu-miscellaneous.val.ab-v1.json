The number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building is proportional to the amount of energy it takes to fill the building.\r\n\r\nAssuming that each balloon requires 300 kilograms of weight and requires 160 joules of heat to go from one level to the next, the required energy for filling the Empire State Building would be:\r\n\r\nAmount of energy required = R * (T/m)\r\n\r\n1. R stands for the number of balloons required, T stands for the total height of the building (100 stories tall), and m stands for the mass of each balloon (300 kg).
