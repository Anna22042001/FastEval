They are an important and fundamental process in genetics, and they are often called \"haplotypes\" (see [haplotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype)).

Recessive alleles can be inherited from a single parent, and they are transmitted from the mother to the father, but they don't increase the odds of the trait. The recessive allele can be present in the affected individual with no apparent relevance to the phenotype. In contrast, dominant alleles carry more power than recessive alleles and can completely control the traits of their parents. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a dominant allele is one that can be inherited from both parents, and it influences the phenotype more than a recessive allele.
