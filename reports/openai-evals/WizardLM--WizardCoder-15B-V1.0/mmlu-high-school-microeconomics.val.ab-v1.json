It is upward-sloping when employment is increasing compared to the wage level, and downward-sloping when employment is decreasing compared to the wage level. An increase in the minimum wage is, in general, beneficial to all workers and employers. \n\nFor example, in the US, an increase in the minimum wage could lead to an increase in employment and job creation, which could lead to a boom in wealth, income, and the economy as a whole. Similarly, an increase in the minimum wage could lead to a decrease in unemployment and inflation, which could impact the economy negatively. However, an increase in the minimum wage could also cause a decrease in employment and job creation, which could impair the effectiveness of job markets and cause other economic issues. Overall, an increase in the minimum wage is not always beneficial or harmful for all workers and employers, but it is generally beneficial for many in the long run.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhen the labor demand curve is downward-sloping, an increase in the minimum wage is\nA) beneficial to all workers and employers\nB) beneficial to some workers and harmful to other workers\nC) harmful to all workers and employers\nD) beneficial to all workers and harmful to some employers", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 21:49:30.499433+00:00"}
