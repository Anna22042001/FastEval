So, we can try to find the order  of x.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we can see that the element x is the coefficient of x^n in the above representation. So, we can try to find the value of n such that x^n is a rational number. \r\n\r\nSince x^n is a rational number, then one of its factors must be a prime number, i.e., a prime factor of x^n. Therefore, x^n = a_1 x^(n-1) + a_2 x^(n-2) +... + a_k x^2 + a_k+1.\r\n\r\nNow, let us consider this expression, a_1 x^(n-1) + a_2 x^(n-2) +... + a_k x^2 + a_k+1.\r\n\r\nNote that, x^2 is not a prime factor of x^n and its coefficient will be 0. Also, since the expression contains x^2, it means that x^2 is not a square number. Therefore, we cannot write x^2 as a factor of x^n.\r\n\r\nSo, we can factor out x^2 from the expression. We can do this by multiplying x^2 to both sides of the expression. Therefore, we have (a_1 x^(n-1) + a_2 x^(n-2) +... + a_k x^2 + a_k+1)x^2.\r\n\r\nNote that, if we do a polynomial division with x^2, then we will get two polynomials separated by x^2.
