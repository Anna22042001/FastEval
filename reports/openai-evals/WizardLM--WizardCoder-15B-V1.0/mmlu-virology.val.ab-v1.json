Molecular biology has played a crucial role in determining the fundamental mechanisms of DNA replication. One of the key discoveries was the advent of the replication process in adenoviruses. The replication process consists of four stages: initiation, elongation, termination, and synthesis of chromosomal DNA. A major contribution to the elongation of chromosomal DNA is the establishment of a replication fork, which plays a role in initiating the copying of replicating DNA in the nucleus of the host cell. Another important discovery is the importance of RT (ribosomal transfer protein) in adenovirus replication.
