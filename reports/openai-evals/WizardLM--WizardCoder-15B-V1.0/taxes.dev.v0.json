Let's assume the tax rate is the same as 2021.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total taxable income. Assuming I am taking up any tax reliefs, the total taxable income for my income tax would be $50,000.\n\nNext, we need to find the individual tax bracket that my income falls under based on the tax rate. According to the IRS's 2021 income tax rate, the individual tax bracket that my income falls under is the first income tax bracket: $0 to $9,750.\n\nNow that we know the tax bracket I fall under, let's calculate the tax rate on my earnings. According to the IRS, for the first income tax bracket, the rate on my earnings is 10% of the taxable income. Therefore:\n\nTax Rate = 0.10 * 50,000 = $5000\n\nWe also need to calculate the taxable amount, which is equal to the taxable income less any deductions. Our taxable income is $50,000, so the taxable amount is $50,000 minus any tax credits or deductions.\n\nFinally, we can calculate my tax liability by multiplying the tax rate by the taxable amount.\n\nTax Liability = Tax Rate * Taxable Amount\n\nTax Liability = 0.10 * (50,000 - 0)\nTax Liability = $5000\n\nSince the tax liability is $5,000, the answer is B.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Instructions: You will be presented with a tax calculation and four options A through D.
