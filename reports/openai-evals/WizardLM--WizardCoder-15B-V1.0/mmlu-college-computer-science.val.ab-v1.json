Since we are interested in the growth of the number of entries in the table, we can ignore the actual keys that were hashed to each bucket. Therefore, we can assume that each bucket has initially zero entries, and we are inserting new perfect square numbers into the table.\r\n\r\nAs we insert the first perfect square number, it will hash to bucket 0. If the number 1 is subsequently inserted, it will hash to bucket 1. If 4 is inserted, it will hash to bucket 2. If 9 is inserted, it will hash to bucket 3. All subsequent inserts will take this same pattern. At some point, all four buckets will be full.\r\n\r\nIf we now insert the next perfect square number, the hash function will assign it to the same bucket as the previous number. For example, if 16 is inserted, it will hash to bucket 0 since bucket 3 was already full. If 25 is inserted, it will hash to bucket 1 since bucket 0 was already full. If 36 is inserted, it will hash to bucket 2 since bucket 1 was already full. If 49 is inserted, it will hash to bucket 3 since bucket 2 was already full. The pattern will not change, with each bucket taking up two thirds of the table, with the other two buckets receiving no entries.\r\n\r\nThis process continues indefinitely, with each insert causing one of the four buckets to become fuller and another to become more empty.
