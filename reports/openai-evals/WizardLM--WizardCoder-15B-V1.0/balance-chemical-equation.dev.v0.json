In this example, the atoms are Carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), Sulfur (S), and Selenium (Se), and there are 6 H in the equation, 15 O and 6 Se in the equation. \r\n\r\nTo balance the equation, you need to make sure that the electrons on each atom are either conserved or equalized. When adding more of a particular element, you need to make sure you don't lose any electrons from that element. In this case, if we add 1 oxygen to each atom in the equation, we are left with:\r\n\r\n- 2C = 6 + 26-6 = 22 (4 electrons lost from C)\r\n- 5H = 6 + 2 + 32-7 = 37 (4 electrons lost from H)\r\n- 10O = 15 + 102-15 = 117 (4 electrons lost from O)\r\n- 13Se = 6 + 2 + 56-7 = 61 (4 electrons lost from Se)\r\n\r\nIf we try to add any oxygen, hydrogen, or selenium to any atom, we are left with too few electrons. Therefore, we need to modify the equation to make sure that the electrons on each atom are conserved or equalized. Here are two possible ways you can do that:\r\n\r\n1.
