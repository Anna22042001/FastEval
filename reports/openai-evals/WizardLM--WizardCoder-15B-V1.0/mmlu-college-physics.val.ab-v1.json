The principle of ray optics is that a ray of light follows the shortest path between two points. In the case of light entering an object, this principle is used to determine whether the ray will bend or reflect and to which surface of the object it will be reflected. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Fermat's principle of ray optics can be used to answer the question \"which of the following?\" by providing an explanation of the various principles involved in light interception and refraction by optical objects. \r\n\r\nIn the case of Snell's law of refraction, this principle states that the angle between the normal (perpendicular) to the surface of the object and the direction of the incoming light ray is inversely proportional to the speed of the light. The law is derived from observations regarding the refractive index of a solid or liquid. When a ray of light passes through an object, its speed is increased or decreased to maintain its perpendicularity to the surface. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the law of reflection states that the angle between the surface normal and the direction of the incoming light ray remains constant or approximately constant. When a ray of light passes through an object, it either reflects or refracts and bends to the other surface.\r\n\r\nRayleigh's Criterion, on the other hand, is used to determine the resolution of an image. It is based on the principle that an image of an object at different distances from the observer should show greater detail and uniformity as the distance is decreased.
