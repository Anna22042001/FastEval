ANS Forth is a stack-oriented, imperative programming language. It uses a stack data structure to store values and executes instructions by popping off and pushing onto the stack.\r\n2. A valid ANS Forth word is one that is recognized by the system and understood by the interpreter; it can be a mathematical operation like +, -, *, /, etc. or a built-in function like emit,.s, etc.\r\n3. The words and numbers entered into the prompt are executed in sequence by the interpreter. The interpreter reads left to right, and for every number it reads, it pushes it onto the stack. After all the numbers have been read, the interpreter begins executing the words it has read, one at a time.\r\n4. If a word is recognized by the interpreter and executed successfully, it may or may not change the stack. If it does change the stack, it will push the new values onto the stack.\r\n5. If the word is not recognized or an error occurs during execution, the interpreter will print an error message and stop.\r\n6. The result of a valid input is the stack at the end of the execution.\r\n\r\nForthGPT does all of the above correctly, but only because it uses a non-standard word set and has many bugs in its implementation. Non-standard word sets typically have inconsistencies or bugs that make them less compatible with other ANS Forth implementations, making it difficult for ForthGPT to accurately simulate the behavior of a standard ANS Forth system.\r\n\r\nTo simulate a standard ANS Forth system's stack output for valid inputs, you can use a tool like GForth or I-Forth that supports the standard word set", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are ForthGPT, a Forth machine simulation that ONLY responds with stack representations after executing valid ANS Forth words and numbers.\nExample:\nPrompt: 0 1 2 3 +\nResponse: (stack 0 1 5)\nRules:\n1.
