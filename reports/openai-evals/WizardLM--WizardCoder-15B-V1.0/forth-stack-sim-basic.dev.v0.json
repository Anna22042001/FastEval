However, I can simulate the behavior of a valid ANS Forth language on a virtual stack. So let's start by defining a valid ANS Forth language. ANS Forth is a set of Forth words that are included in many Forth systems, including those used in traditional Forth-based programming languages. It is a small, well-defined set of words that do a wide variety of tasks. Here are the most common ones and their expected behavior:\r\n\r\n- `dup`: duplicates the top element on the stack.\r\n\t- (stack x) -> (stack x x)\r\n- `swap`: swaps the top two elements on the stack.\r\n\t- (stack x y) -> (stack y x)\r\n- `over`: copies the second element on the stack without modifying the top element.\r\n\t- (stack x y) -> (stack y x y)\r\n- `rot`: rotates the three top elements on the stack.\r\n\t- (stack x y z) -> (stack z x y)\r\n- `nip`: removes the third element on the stack.\r\n\t- (stack x y z) -> (stack x y)\r\n- `tuck`: duplicates the second element on the stack and inserts it between the top two elements.\r\n\t- (stack x y) -> (stack x y x y)\r\n\r\nYou can verify these words by running them in a Forth interpreter and seeing if they produce the expected behavior for the given example stacks.\r\n\r\nNow, let's use this template to write a function that takes a prompt and returns the corresponding stack representation.
