This means that the model is built around the assumption that the residuals in the time series are independent of each other, meaning they are not affected by previous values of the series. Therefore, any model that violates this assumption is not an ARIMA model.\r\n\r\n**(ii) An ARIMA(p,1,q) model estimated on a series of logs of prices is equivalent to an ARIMA(p,0,q) model estimated on a set of continuously compounded returns.**\r\n\r\nThis statement is true because if a price series is modeled using an ARIMA(p,1,q) model, we can easily obtain the continuously compounded returns by taking the log of the prices and differencing them. This will result in a new series of returns, which we can then model using an ARIMA(p,0,q) model.\r\n\r\n**(iii) It is plausible for financial time series that the optimal value of d could be 2 or 3.**\r\n\r\nThis is a personal opinion, but based on my experience with time series analysis, financial time series usually have very small fluctuations compared to the overall trend of the market. Therefore, it is plausible to use d=0 or 1 in the ARIMA model.\r\n\r\n**(iv) The estimation of ARIMA models is incompatible with the notion of cointegration.**\r\n\r\nThis is correct.
