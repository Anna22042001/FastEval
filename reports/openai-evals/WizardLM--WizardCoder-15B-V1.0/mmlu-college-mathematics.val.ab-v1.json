For a given point (a,b), the corresponding point on the z-plane is (a+bi). The equation z^2 = |z|^2 is a special type of equation that applies to such points on the z-plane. It means that the point lies on the complex z-plane and the distance of the point to the origin is equal to its absolute value, i.e., |z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Substituting this into the equation and simplifying, we get: z^2 = a^2 + b^2. This is equivalent to the equation z^2 = r^2, where r is the distance from the origin. \r\n\r\nTo represent this in the z-plane, we draw a line with direction given by the point (a,b) and perpendicular to the positive x-axis. The intersection of this line with the x-axis gives the point (a,b) in the z-plane. We can also draw a circle centered at the origin with radius r to reflect the fact that the circle has the same center as the z-axis (the distance of the origin from (a,b) is equal to its absolute value r). \r\n\r\nThe set of points satisfying the equation z^2 = |z|^2 is a half-line, because its image under conjugation (a+bi) is a line perpendicular to the positive x-axis. We can also say that this set is a subset of the upper half-plane (the region above the x-axis).
