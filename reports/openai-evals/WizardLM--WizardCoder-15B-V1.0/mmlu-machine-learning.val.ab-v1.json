The test error starts to increase after some point due to overfitting of the model, which is common in situations where there are too many features and the model starts to fit spurious correlation between the features and the response variable.

However, even with regularization, the test error can still increase if the model is too complex, too many features, or the data is not well-suited for the problem at hand.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nYou observe the following while fitting a linear regression to the data: As you increase the amount of training data, the test error decreases and the training error increases.

This can be simplified as follows:\n\nMSE = Σ(y_i - β_0)^2 / N\n\nwhere N is the number of observations. Here, β_0 refers to the intercept term, and y_i refers to the i-th observation of the response variable. The formula for MSE is derived from the central limit theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean is normal and the variance of the sample mean is equal to the variance of the population divided by n, where n is the number of observations in the sample. However, we have included the intercept term in our model to make the model more flexible, which means that it is necessary to adjust our interpretation of the mean squared error to account for the extra degree of freedom. By adding a constant term to the model, we can achieve this. Adding the constant term to our model, we get:\n\nMSE = Σ(y_i - β_0 - γ_0)^2 / N\n\nwhere γ_0 is the constant term. If the constant term is zero, then the MSE reduces to the MSE of the original model without the constant term. This is because the model without the constant term has the same effect as the model with the constant term, since the intercept term corresponds to the mean of the response variable. Therefore, the MSE without the constant term is a more meaningful measure of model fit than the MSE with the constant term, even though the former is a simpler model.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFor the one-parameter model, mean-Square error (MSE) is defined as follows: 1/(2N) \\sum (y_n − β_0)^2 .
