First, we need to understand the prompt:\n   1. `1 << 6`: We start with the integer 1 (which is represented in binary as 0b00000001) and we left-shift it by 6 bits (which means we multiply it by 2 to the power of 6). This results in 64, which is 0b01000000 in binary.\n   2. `& ~( 2 ^ 16 )`: We take the bitwise AND of 64 (0b01000000) and a bitwise NOT of 32768 (0b1000000000000000), which is equivalent to subtracting 32768 from 64. This results in 0, which is 0b00000000 in binary.\n   3. `^ 19 ^ 12`: We take the bitwise XOR of 19 (0b000010011) and 12 (0b000001100), which results in 45 (0b000011001).\n   4. `>> 3`: We right-shift the result of 45 (0b000011001) by 3 bits, which is equivalent to dividing by 2 to the power of 3. This results in 14 (0b000000110), which is the desired output.\n\n2.
