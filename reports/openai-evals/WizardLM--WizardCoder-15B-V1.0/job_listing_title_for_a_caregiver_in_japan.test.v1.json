To clarify, a caregiver or \"helper\" often refers specifically to someone who doesn't work a full-time job, but can provide some sort of support or assistance in a non-job related way. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the term \"part-time worker\" does not accurately capture the different types of employment, as a part-time worker can be a variety of different jobs, from mowing the lawn to assisting in the cleaning of a laundry room.
