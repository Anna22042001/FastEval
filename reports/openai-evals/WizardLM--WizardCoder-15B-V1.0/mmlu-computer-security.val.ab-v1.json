However, a client certificate is optional, as it does not provide any additional security benefits. If a client provides a client certificate, the server can verify the identity of the client and apply the appropriate access controls. The presence of a client certificate does not make the connection secure against attacks like an attacker stealing the server's private key and reading its plaintext.
