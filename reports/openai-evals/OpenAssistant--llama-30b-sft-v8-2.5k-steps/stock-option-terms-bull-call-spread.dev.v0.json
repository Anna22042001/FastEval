This is because if the stock price increases above $340, the $340 strike price call will be in-the-money and can be exercised, resulting in a gain of $76 per share ($340 - $264). On the other hand, if the stock price decreases below $245, the $245 strike price call will be in-the-money and can be exercised, resulting in a loss of $211 per share ($245 - $264).\n\nTherefore, in order to maximize returns, it would be beneficial for the stock price to increase above $340.\n\nI hope this helps!
