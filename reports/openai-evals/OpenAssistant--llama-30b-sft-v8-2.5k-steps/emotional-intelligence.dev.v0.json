It may also prove beneficial to look into whether or not everyone responsible for operating the affected tools had proper training, certifications, etc...

It also assumes that Celia has the authority to address her coworker's behavior directly. If she does have that authority and feels comfortable doing so, then this could potentially resolve the issue quickly. However, it may not be the best approach depending on the specific circumstances.\n\nc - Ask for an explanation of her lateness: This is a non-confrontational approach that seeks to understand the root cause of the problem before taking further action. Depending on the reason given, Celia can decide whether to let it go, talk to her supervisor, or take other steps. It allows for open communication between the two employees which may improve their working relationship overall. However, there is no guarantee that the other employee will provide an adequate explanation.\n\nb - Tell the boss about it: Celia should bring this matter to the attention of her immediate superior only after trying to address the issue with the woman herself first.
