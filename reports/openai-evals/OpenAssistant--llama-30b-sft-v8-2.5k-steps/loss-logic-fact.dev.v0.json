Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" or \"D\" or \"E\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}], "invalid_choice": true}}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 09:41:04.830012+00:00"}
