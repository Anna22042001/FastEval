To calculate the pH of the given acid solution, we need to use the following equation:\npH = -log[aH+]\nwhere [aH+] is the concentration of hydronium ions in the solution and a is the dissociation constant of the acid. In this case, [aH+] = 0.0002 * 0.5 = 8 x 10^-6 mol/L and a = 1 x 10^(-13) L/mol.
