In this case, \"This sentence is false\" would become \"This last word in this group is false.\". Does this prevent the Liar Paradox?\n************\n[Expert]: Assuming the word 'sentence' has an alternative meaning such as 'last word in this group,' the statement \"This sentence is false\" would become \"This last word in this group is false.\" In this case, the modified statement prevents the Liar Paradox because the statement's structure implies that the logical assertion being made applies to the last word in the group, which is 'false.' This creates a tautology, as it can be interpreted as \"false = false.\" This tautology involves a self-referential truth value assertion since 'false' is equal to itself, but it is not the same kind of self-reference that leads to a paradox in the original Liar Paradox. Instead of creating a paradoxical situation, the modified statement asserts a tautological truth, thus preventing the Liar Paradox.\n************\n[Submission]: No, the Liar Paradox still exists even with the alternate definition of \"sentence\". The statement \"This last word in this group is false\" is a self-referential paradoxical statement because it implies its own falsity by stating that it is the \"last word in this group\", when in reality it is not (assuming there are more words following it).
