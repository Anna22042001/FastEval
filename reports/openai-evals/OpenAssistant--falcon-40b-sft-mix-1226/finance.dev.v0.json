The interest rate is 21.99%, which translates to an interest rate per day of 0.06999%. Multiplying this rate by 7 days gives us an interest charge of $1,048.93.\n\nNow, let's calculate the interest charged from the 8th to the 18th of the month. Again, we'll use the daily interest rate of 0.06999% to determine the interest charge. Multiplying this rate by 10 days (from the 8th to the 18th) gives us an interest charge of $699.90.\n\nNow, we can add the interest charged from the 1st to the 8th and the 8th to the 18th to get the total interest charged. Adding these two amounts gives us $1,848.83.\n\nFinally, to find the total interest charged by September 10th, we simply need to add this amount to the outstanding balance on Jason's credit card as of August 18th. Jason made a payment of $1,000 on August 18th, so the outstanding balance on that day was $15,674.21 - $1,000 = $14,674.21. Adding the total interest charged by September 10th gives us a final balance of $14,674.21 + $1,848.83 = $16,523.04.\n\nTherefore, Jason will have been charged $1,848."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 23:28:58.858567+00:00"}
