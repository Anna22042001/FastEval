UDP glucuronosyltransferase is an enzyme that helps remove bilirubin from the body by conjugating it with glucuronic acid, making it water-soluble and easier to excrete. A decrease in the activity of this enzyme can lead to an accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin, which is the form that causes jaundice. The normal reference ranges for serum total bilirubin concentration are 0.3-1.9 mg/dL, with a direct component of less than 0.3 mg/dL. In Gilbert's syndrome, serum total bilirubin concentrations are typically elevated, but the direct component remains normal, which is consistent with the patient's laboratory results.
