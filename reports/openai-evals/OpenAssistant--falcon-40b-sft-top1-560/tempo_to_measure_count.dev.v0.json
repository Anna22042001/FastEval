However, some of the notes have a duration that is shorter than a full beat, such as the eighth and sixteenth notes. To account for this, we can use a technique called beaming, which groups together notes of the same value and duration. Beaming the notes as follows:\n\n[ Quarter Note, Half Note, Eighth Note, Three Eighth Notes, Two Eighth Notes, Two Eighth Notes, Two Eighth Notes, Two Eighth Notes, Quarter Note, Two Sixteenth Notes, Two Sixteenth Notes, Whole Note ]\n\nNow, if we count the number of beats, we get:\n\n[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1 ]\n\nSo, dividing the total number of notes by the number of beats per measure, we get:\n\n13 / 2 = 6.5\n\nSince there are only whole numbers of measures, we round down and say that the list takes up 6 measures.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 6."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 12:06:14.749964+00:00"}
