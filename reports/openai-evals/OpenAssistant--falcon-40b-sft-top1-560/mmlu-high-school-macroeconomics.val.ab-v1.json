A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that can be charged for a good or service. When a price ceiling is imposed, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, resulting in a shortage.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a price increase in a market despite an increase in demand does not necessarily contradict the law of demand. The law of demand states that, all other things being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases. However, there may be other factors at play in the market that are causing the demand to increase despite the higher price, such as a change in consumer preferences, income, or the prices of related goods.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a shift in the demand for a good does not necessarily affect its price. The price of a good is determined by the interaction of its supply and demand in the market. A shift in demand can cause the demand curve to shift to the right or left, resulting in a higher or lower equilibrium price, respectively. However, a shift in demand alone does not cause the price to change.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a shift in the supply of a good can cause its price to change, but it is not the only possible cause.
