Given that you are a college student and that your internship is located in San Francisco, your income will be taxed in California. In 2021, California had a progressive income tax rate ranging from 1% to 13.3%, with taxable income brackets that start at $0 and go up to $1,001,599. Based on this information, your total income tax would be:\n\n50,000 x 0.1 (1% tax on the first $47,999 of taxable income) = $47.99\n(50,000 - 47.99) x 0.2 (2% tax on taxable income between $48,000 and $59,999) = $478.18\n(50,000 - 478.18) x 0.25 (3% tax on taxable income between $60,000 and $77,499) = 1,431.81\n(50,000 - 1,431.81) x 0.3265 (4% tax on taxable income between $77,500 and $263,299) = 7,587.19\n(50,000 - 7,587.19) x 0.33 (5% tax on taxable income between $263,300 and $301,599) = 8,038.81\n(50,000 - 8,038.81) x 0.3465 (6% tax on taxable income between $301,600 and $513,599) = 16,587.95\n(50,000 - 16,587.95) x 0.3635 (7% tax on taxable income between $513,600 and $1,001,599) =", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Instructions: You will be presented with a tax calculation and four options A through D.
