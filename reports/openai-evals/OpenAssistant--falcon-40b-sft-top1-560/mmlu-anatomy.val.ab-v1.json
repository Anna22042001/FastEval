This term describes the body's ability to maintain its normal state, also known as its physiological equilibrium. Factors such as temperature, pH, and hydration status are regulated to ensure that the body functions optimally. The process of maintaining homeostasis involves various feedback mechanisms that ensure that changes in the body's internal environment are detected and corrected.\n\nA) Catabolism and anabolism are terms used in metabolism to describe two opposing biochemical processes within the body. Catabolism refers to the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones to generate energy, while anabolism refers to the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones. Together, these processes regulate the body's energy balance and ensure that cells have the necessary building blocks to function properly.\n\nB) Tolerance refers to the body's ability to become resistant to the effects of a substance, such as a drug or a toxin, over time. This can be either acquired or innate, depending on the type of tolerance being discussed. Tolerance is a protective mechanism that helps the body maintain homeostasis by reducing the impact of harmful substances. However, it can also be detrimental, as it can lead to the development of dependence and addiction.\n\nD) None of the other options describe the body's ability to maintain its normal state.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following terms describes the body's ability to maintain its normal state?\nA) Catabolism\nB) Anabolism\nC) Homeostasis\nD) Tolerance", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 02:43:31.632837+00:00"}
