The $240 put, $250 put, $262.5 call, and $255 call options are all sold in a strangle because they are out-of-the-money (OTM) options with different strike prices. The strategy involves simultaneously selling and buying options with different strike prices but the same underlying asset and expiration date to create a range of potential outcomes.\n\nThe put options give the owner the right to sell the underlying asset at a specific price (the strike price) by a certain date (the expiration date). The call options give the owner the right to buy the underlying asset at a specific price (the strike price) by a certain date (the expiration date). The strangle strategy is designed to profit from a large move in either direction of the underlying asset's price, while limiting the risk and potential losses.\n\nIn this example, the $240 put and $262.5 call are sold to generate income, while the $250 put and $255 call are bought to protect against downside risk. By selling OTM options, the investor collects premium, which is the amount of money received for selling the option. However, if the underlying asset's price moves outside the range defined by the strike prices of the sold options, the investor could incur significant losses. Buying OTM options helps limit those losses, but it also reduces the potential for income and increases the overall cost of the strategy.\n\nThe choice of strike prices and expiration dates will depend on the investor's risk tolerance, market outlook, and expectations for the underlying asset's price movement.
