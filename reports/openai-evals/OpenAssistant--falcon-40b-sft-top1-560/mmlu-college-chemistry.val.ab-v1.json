The broader EPR spectrum in the more concentrated solution is due to the hyperfine interaction between the TEMPO molecules and their surrounding environment, such as solvent molecules or nearby metal ions. This interaction causes the absorption frequency of the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal to shift, resulting in a broader spectrum.
