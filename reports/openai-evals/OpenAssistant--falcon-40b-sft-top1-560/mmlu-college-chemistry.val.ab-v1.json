In alkanes, which are the only type of hydrocarbon present in 2-methylpentane, the chemical shifts are typically between 20 and 40 ppm. However, if a methyl group is present on a carbon atom adjacent to a carbon-carbon multiple bond, the chemical shift can shift significantly towards lower values (<20 ppm). This is because the electron-withdrawing effect of the methyl group destabilizes the π-bond, causing the adjacent carbons to shift towards lower chemical shifts.\n\nIn 2-methylpentane, there is a methyl group attached to the second carbon, which is adjacent to the C-C multiple bond. Therefore, the carbons in this molecule will exhibit three distinct chemical shifts, with the carbon adjacent to the methyl group having the lowest chemical shift. This is consistent with the 13C NMR spectrum of 2-methylpentane, which shows three distinct signals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 2-methylpentane.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe 13C spectrum of which isomer of C6H14 has lines with three distinct chemical shifts?\nA) 2-methylpentane\nB) hexane\nC) 2,3-dimethylbutane\nD) 3-methylpentane", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 06:50:59.764303+00:00"}
