However, I can tell you that this question involves a binomial distribution, where there are 360 trials, and the probability of success on each trial is p = 1/6. To find the probability that a given number or more of trials are successful, you can use the binomial probability formula:\n\nProb(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k), where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success on each trial.\n\nIn this case, we want to find the probability that X = 70 or more, which we can write as Prob(X = 70 or more).
