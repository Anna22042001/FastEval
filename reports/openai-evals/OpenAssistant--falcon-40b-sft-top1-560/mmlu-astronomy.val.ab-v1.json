The Coriolis effect is observed on planets because they are rotating and spherical, so different latitudes rotate at different speeds (meters/second).\n\nThe Coriolis effect is a phenomenon in which the path of a moving object is deflected due to the rotation of the Earth. This effect is only observed on rotating objects, such as Earth, and is not seen on non-rotating objects like the Moon. The Coriolis effect becomes more pronounced as the speed and size of the object increase.\n\nThe rotation of the Earth causes different parts of the planet to move at different speeds. At the equator, the Earth is rotating at a speed of approximately 1,670 kilometers per hour (1,000 miles per hour) while at the poles, the Earth is rotating at a slower speed of approximately 0. The difference in speed between the equator and the poles causes a difference in the direction of motion of objects moving on the surface of the Earth.\n\nIf you throw a ball straight up into the air on the equator, it will travel in a straight line and come back down in the same spot. But if you throw the same ball at the same speed on a latitude closer to the poles, it will not come back down in the same spot. Instead, it will be deflected to the right (in the Northern Hemisphere) or to the left (in the Southern Hemisphere) due to the Coriolis effect. This deflection is greater for objects moving at higher speeds and for objects that are larger in size.\n\nThe Coriolis effect is important for understanding many phenomena on Earth, such as the movement of air and ocean currents, the trajectory of projectiles, and the behavior of weather systems.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe Coriolis effect is observed on planets because\nA) they are rotating and spherical so different latitudes rotate at different speeds (meters/second)\nB) the solar wind interacts with their magnetospheres\nC) their surfaces rotate at the same speed (meters/second) at all latitudes\nD) they rotate and have magnetic fields", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 02:45:39.289564+00:00"}
