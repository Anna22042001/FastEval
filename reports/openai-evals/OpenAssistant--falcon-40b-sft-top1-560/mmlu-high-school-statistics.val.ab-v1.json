A binomial probability model is most appropriate when you are looking at a sequence of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (success or failure), where the probability of success is constant for each trial. In the case of drawing cards from a well-shuffled deck, each draw is an independent trial, success is defined as drawing an ace, and the probability of success is constant at 1/52 for each draw. Therefore, a binomial probability model is a good choice to determine the probability of drawing all four aces in a certain number of tries.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFor which of these is a binomial probability model most reasonable?\nA) The number of times that a randomly selected resident of California has visited a museum in the last 12 months\nB) The colors of the cars in the parking lot of a particular grocery store on a randomly selected Sunday\nC) The number of cards drawn from a well-shuffled deck until all four aces are found\nD) The number of times, out of 10 attempts, that a particular child can throw a ball into a basket from six feet away", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 08:18:32.948783+00:00"}

So, if we take a random sample of size n from a population and calculate the mean of these n values, we can be confident that the standard deviation of this sample mean will give us a good estimate of the population standard deviation.\n\nNow, if we increase the size of our sample to 4n and take another random sample from the population, we will still be able to calculate a good estimate of the population standard deviation. In other words, the standard deviation of the set of sample means will be the same, regardless of the size of the sample.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nRandom samples of size n are drawn from a population.
