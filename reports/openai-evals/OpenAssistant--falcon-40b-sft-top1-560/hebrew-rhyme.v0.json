Here's a basic outline of how you can implement this task:\n\n1. Obtain a list of Hebrew words and their English translations. You can do this by using a dictionary or online resources.\n\n2. Define a function that takes two words (in English) as input and returns True if their Hebrew translations rhyme, or False if they do not. To compare the last two letters of the words, you can use the [string.rsplit()][1] method to split each word into a list and retrieve the last two elements.\n\n3. Use the function to compare all pairs of words in the list. For each pair that rhymes, print the English words and their Hebrew translations. For pairs that do not rhyme, print \"NONE\".\n\nHere's an example Python function that compares two words and returns True if their Hebrew translations rhyme, or False if they do not:\n\n```python\ndef rhyme(word1, word2):\n    # split each word into a list and retrieve the last two elements\n    word1_split = word1.rsplit('', 2)\n    word2_split = word2.rsplit('', 2)\n    \n    # convert the last two elements to Hebrew if they are not already\n    word1_hebrew = word1_split[-2].capitalize() + word1_split[-1].capitalize()\n    word2_hebrew = word2_split[-2].capitalize() + word2_split[-1].capitalize()\n    \n    # compare the last two elements of the words"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 02:13:22.123124+00:00"}
