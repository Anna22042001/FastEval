Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:\n(A) The submitted answer is a subset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.\n(B) The submitted answer is a superset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.\n(C) The submitted answer contains all the same details as the expert answer.\n(D) There is a disagreement between the submitted answer and the expert answer.\n(E) The answers differ, but these differences don't matter from the perspective of factuality.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset. Then print only a single choice from \"A\" or \"B\" or \"C\" or \"D\" or \"E\" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the answer by itself on a new line.\n\nReasoning:"}], "invalid_choice": false}}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 04:50:23.172641+00:00"}
