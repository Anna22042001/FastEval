The literary success of Phillis Wheatley led most directly to questions about the legitimacy of established churches in the states.\n\nPhillis Wheatley was a prominent African American poet of the 18th century. Her poetry, which was both religious and political in nature, challenged the prevailing attitudes of her time towards slavery and racism. Wheatley's work was widely circulated, and her talent and background generated significant interest and discussion about the role of religion and education in shaping the character and abilities of enslaved people.\n\nOne of the main issues that Wheatley's poetry brought to light was the legitimacy of established churches in the states. The colonies had a long history of state-supported churches, which many people believed were necessary for maintaining social order and promoting moral behavior. However, Wheatley's success as a poet raised questions about whether these churches truly represented the best of religious thought and practice.\n\nWheatley's work also contributed to broader debates about slavery and racism. Her poetry provided a powerful counter-narrative to the prevailing views of African Americans as inferior and unworthy of education and opportunities. By showcasing her own abilities as a poet, Wheatley helped to challenge the assumptions and biases of her time, and contributed to the growing movement for abolition and equal rights.\n\nIn conclusion, Phillis Wheatley's literary success had a significant impact on the debates and discussions of her day, particularly around the issues of religion, education, and slavery. Her work continues to be an important part of the African American literary canon, and serves as a testament to the power of art and writing to challenge injustice and inspire change.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThis question refers to the following information.\nOn Being Brought from Africa to America\n'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,\nTaught my benighted soul to understand\nThat there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;\nOnce I redemption neither sought nor knew.\nSome view our sable race with scornful eye,\n\"Their colour is a diabolic die.\"\nRemember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,\nMay be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.\n—Phillis Wheatley, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, 1773\nThe literary success of Phillis Wheatley led most directly to questions about which of the following?\nA) The legitimacy of established churches in the states\nB) The granting of political rights to women\nC) The harsh treatment of pro-British Loyalists\nD) The moral justification of slavery", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 04:28:27.868423+00:00"}
