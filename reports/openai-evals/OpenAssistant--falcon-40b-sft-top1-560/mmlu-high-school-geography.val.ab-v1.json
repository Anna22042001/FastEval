In the United States, deindustrialization refers to the decline of the industrial sector, including manufacturing, mining, and agriculture.

Detroit is a prime example of a city that has been affected by deindustrialization, with the closure of many of its once-thriving manufacturing plants.\n\nThe other options are not the correct causes of Detroit's population decline.\n\nAgglomeration refers to the clustering of economic activity in a specific location, such as a city or region. This can lead to increased productivity and innovation, but it is not the cause of Detroit's population decline.\n\nConurbation refers to the merging of two or more cities into one larger urban area. While this can lead to population growth, it is not the cause of Detroit's population decline.\n\nGentrification refers to the process of revitalizing a neighborhood through the influx of more affluent residents. While this can lead to increases in property values, it is not the cause of Detroit's population decline.\n\nIn conclusion, Detroit's shrinking population can be attributed to deindustrialization, which has led to job losses, a decrease in tax revenue, and a general decline in the city's economy.
