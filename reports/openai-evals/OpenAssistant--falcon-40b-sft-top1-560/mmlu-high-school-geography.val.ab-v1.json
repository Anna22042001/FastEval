According to this model, there are four stages:\n\nStage 1: Pre-industrial society\nHigh birth and death rates, with a short life expectancy. This stage is characterized by low population growth due to high infant mortality and other causes of high death rates.\nStage 2: Early stage of demographic transition\nDeclining death rates due to improvements in public health, medicine, and sanitation. Birth rates remain high, resulting in rapid population growth.\nStage 3: Late stage of demographic transition\nFurther decline in death rates, along with a continued decline in birth rates. Population growth begins to level off as the mortality rate approaches that of developed countries.\nStage 4: Post-industrial society\nLow birth and death rates, with a stable or slightly declining population. This stage is characterized by a low population growth rate due to a low total fertility rate (TFR, the average number of children born to a woman).\n\nStage 3 is characterized by high birth rates and declining death rates, leading to rapid population growth.
