Estimation bias occurs when a model is fitted too closely to the training data and is not generalizable to new, unseen data. In this case, the low train error indicates that the model is overfitting to the training data, which is causing the high test error.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try to reduce overfitting by using techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and early stopping.
