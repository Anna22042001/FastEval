In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft.

During this time, scientists began to use the scientific method to better understand the natural world, leading to breakthroughs in fields such as physics, astronomy, and biology.\n\nOne of the key developments during the Scientific Revolution was the improvement of crop yields through advancements in agriculture and farming techniques. Scientists began to understand the importance of soil fertility, crop rotation, and selective breeding, which helped to increase crop yields and reduce the risk of famine.\n\nWhile the Scientific Revolution was occurring during the time this document was created, the other intellectual movements listed were not. Divine Right theory of rule, which was prevalent during the Middle Ages, held that monarchs were appointed by God and had absolute power over their subjects. The Enlightenment, which occurred several centuries later, was a philosophical and intellectual movement that emphasized reason and individualism. And existentialism, which emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, was a philosophy that emphasized the individual's responsibility and freedom in an absurd world.\n\nIn conclusion, the Scientific Revolution was the intellectual movement occurring during the time this document was created that would help improve crop yields and address the famine described in the report.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThis question refers to the following information.\nRead the following governmental report.\nOf the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n—Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following intellectual movements was occurring in Europe at the time this document was created and would help improve crop yields?\nA) The rise of existentialism\nB) Divine Right theory of rule\nC) The Scientific Revolution\nD) The Enlightenment", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-04 07:46:00.328558+00:00"}
