When the labor demand curve is downward-sloping, an increase in the minimum wage is beneficial to some workers and harmful to other workers.

This reduction in the quantity of labor demanded will harm some workers who would have been employed at the old minimum wage, but it will benefit other workers who were previously earning less than the new minimum wage.\n\nThe reason for this is that the minimum wage acts as a price floor for labor. When the minimum wage increases, the price of labor rises, which leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by firms. This means that some workers who were previously earning the old minimum wage will not be able to find employment at the new, higher minimum wage. However, workers who were earning less than the new minimum wage will now be able to find employment at the higher minimum wage, which will be beneficial to them.\n\nOverall, an increase in the minimum wage can result in both positive and negative effects on different groups of workers and employers, depending on their positions on the labor demand curve.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhen the labor demand curve is downward-sloping, an increase in the minimum wage is\nA) beneficial to all workers and employers\nB) beneficial to some workers and harmful to other workers\nC) harmful to all workers and employers\nD) beneficial to all workers and harmful to some employers", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 04:11:35.380326+00:00"}
