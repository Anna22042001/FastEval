Then sort the resulting list of numbers using the built-in `sort()` method of lists, and rejoin the numbers into a string with `,` as separator using a list comprehension. Finally, map the `str()` function to each number to convert them back to strings for the result.\n\nIf you want to print this function's result to the console, you need to print the result of the preceding line, as `return` ends the execution of a function.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Please sort the following comma-separated numbers in a descending order, ignoring any formatting.
