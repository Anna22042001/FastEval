However, some experimental therapies have shown promise in clinical trials and are sometimes used on a compassionate-use basis in people with EVD.  These treatments include:\n\nZMapp: This is a combination of three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target different parts of the Ebola virus. In a clinical trial conducted during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, ZMapp was found to be safe and may have improved survival rates among people with EVD when given early in the course of the disease. However, the trial was not designed to prove that ZMapp was responsible for the better outcomes.\n\nRemdesivir: This is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has been shown to be effective against several viruses, including Ebola. In a clinical trial conducted during the 2018 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, remdesivir was found to be safe and may have improved survival rates among people with EVD when given early in the course of the disease. However, the trial was not designed to prove that remdesivir was responsible for the better outcomes.\n\nConvalescent plasma: This is plasma obtained from people who have recovered from Ebola virus infection and who have developed antibodies against the virus. Convalescent plasma has been used on a compassionate-use basis in people with EVD, but its effectiveness has not yet been proven in well-designed clinical trials.\n\nIt's important to note that even if an experimental treatment shows promise in early trials, it may not be effective or safe when used in a broader population or in different settings.
