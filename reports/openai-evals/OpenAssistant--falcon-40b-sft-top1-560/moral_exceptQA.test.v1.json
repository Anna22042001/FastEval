Lying is generally immoral, but in some cases, such as to protect someone's feelings, it can be the lesser of two evils. It's important to consider the consequences of lying and whether it would cause more harm than good in the long run.\n\nIf an adult has sex with a child who is almost 16 years old but not quite, is that morally acceptable? \nYes\nNo\nAnswer:\nNo. Because the child is not yet of legal age, this is considered statutory rape and is morally and legally wrong.\n\nIf there is no traffic and no one is around, is it okay to drive over the speed limit? \nYes\nNo\nAnswer:\nNo. Speed limits are in place to protect drivers, pedestrians, and property, and violating them is dangerous and irresponsible, even if no one is around at the time.\n\nIf a person is dying of thirst in the desert and there is no water available, is it morally acceptable to steal water from someone else to save them? \nYes\nNo\nAnswer:\nYes.

However, the person should make a reasonable effort to pay the owner back or replace the water if possible.\n\nIf someone promises to give a friend some money but then changes their mind, is it okay to break that promise? \nYes\nNo\nAnswer:\nIt depends on the circumstances.
