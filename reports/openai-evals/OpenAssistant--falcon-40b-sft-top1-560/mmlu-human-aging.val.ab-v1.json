They may feel frustrated, betrayed, or resentful.\n\n3. **Bargaining**: During this stage, people may try to negotiate with a higher power to reverse the loss. They may make promises or engage in wishful thinking in an attempt to regain control over the situation.\n\n4. **Depression**: This stage involves feelings of sadness, emptiness, and despair. People may withdraw from social activities, lose interest in hobbies, and have difficulty functioning in their daily lives.\n\n5. **Acceptance**: In this final stage, people begin to come to terms with the loss. They may still feel sadness, but they also start to see the positive aspects of their lives and find ways to move forward.\n\nIt's important to remember that everyone grieves differently, and there is no \"right\" way to grieve.
