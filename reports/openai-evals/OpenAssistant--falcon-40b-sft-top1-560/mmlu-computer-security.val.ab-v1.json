This statement is False. U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) and SMS codes are both examples of two-factor authentication methods, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. SMS codes are generally considered to be less secure than U2F because they are vulnerable to phishing attacks and SIM swapping. However, SMS codes can still provide an additional layer of security for users, especially if they are used in conjunction with other authentication factors.\n\nStatement 2: An attacker that knows a user’s password can easily guess the U2F key to access the user’s account.\n\nAnswer: B. This statement is False. While it is true that an attacker who has obtained a user’s password can potentially gain access to their account, they would not be able to easily guess the user’s U2F key. U2F keys are generated using cryptographic algorithms and are designed to be extremely difficult to guess or crack. Additionally, U2F keys are typically stored on a separate physical device, such as a security key, which further adds to their security.\n\nIn conclusion, while U2F is generally considered to be a stronger second factor than SMS codes, both methods have their benefits and drawbacks.
