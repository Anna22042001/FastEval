With secure boot, each component in the system verifies the next component in the chain before passing control to it.

It uses an ephemeral key that is derived from the device's unique hardware ID and is destroyed after use.

Even though the secure enclave can prevent Innocent from reading sensitive information such as keys and passwords, it cannot protect the data stored in the flash. This is because the secure enclave does not have direct access to the flash, and the iOS kernel is responsible for mediating access to the flash. Once Innocent has control of the iOS kernel, it can bypass the secure enclave and access the flash directly.\n\nTo protect against this type of attack, iOS uses hardware-backed encryption to protect the data stored on the flash.
