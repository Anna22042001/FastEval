This can happen due to factors such as non-random selection of participants, self-selection into the study, or differential dropout between groups. In the case of the cohort study described in the question, there is a potential for selection bias because the 12,000 patients prescribed the recently approved therapy and the 8,000 patients prescribed conventional therapy were not randomly assigned to their respective groups. Instead, they were matched for baseline blood pressure, age, and gender, which could lead to residual confounding.\n\nType I error (also known as alpha error) refers to the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis, which means concluding that there is a difference between groups when in fact, there is none. This type of error can occur when the statistical test used in the study is too sensitive and thus, results in a false positive finding. In the question, the p-value of 0.01 suggests that the result is statistically significant, which means that the likelihood of a Type I error is relatively low.\n\nType II error (also known as beta error) refers to the probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis, which means concluding that there is no difference between groups when in fact, there is one. This type of error can occur when the statistical test used in the study is not sensitive enough and thus, results in a false negative finding. In the question, the p-value of 0.01 suggests that the result is statistically significant, which means that the likelihood of a Type II error is relatively low.\n\nPublication bias refers to the tendency for researchers to publish only those findings that are statistically significant, which can give a skewed view of the evidence and lead to an overestimation of the effect size.
