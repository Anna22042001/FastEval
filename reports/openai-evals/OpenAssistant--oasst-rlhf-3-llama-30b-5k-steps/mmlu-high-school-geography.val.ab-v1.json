Hence, the answer is A) French and Spanish settlement patterns.\n\nFor further context, the US federal government adopted Rectangular Survey System (RSS) based on several factors. Most parts of the future US were surveyed before declaring independence. When the federal government was created under US Constitution they needed a uniform system for surveying the public domain. The key factor that made RSS attractive was that the system was already well proven by the state surveyors in almost all of the future states, and could be easily translated to federal surveyors throughout the future states.\n\nThe original method is called Township and Range Survey Method, although it became universally known as Rectangular Survey because it used the latitude and longitude to create a grid.\n\nHere is the detailed history of the Rectangular Survey System:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangular_Survey_System", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nThe rectangular land survey system is based on all of the following EXCEPT\nA) French and Spanish settlement patterns.\nB) rural road patterns.\nC) dispersed pattern of isolated farmsteads.\nD) block pattern of land survey.", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 22:27:23.047175+00:00"}

Environmental determinism posited that human actions and society were shaped by natural environment without considering human agency, thus it is considered a reductionist approach to culture. Later in 20th century, this approach was criticized and refuted by other schools of thought such as cultural ecology, possibilism, and cybernetic theory.\n\nIn contrast, cultural ecology focuses on the reciprocal interaction between the environment, technology, social structure, and ideology as interrelated systems. Thus, cultural ecology represents an alternative to environmental determinism framework that emphasizes the mutual co-evolution of humans and their environment rather than reductionistic approach of viewing environment as prime mover.\n\nBeware of the distinction between B) cultural ecology and C) possibilism, since both concepts are concerned with the relationship between humans and environment. In fact, possibilism is an approach within anthropology and archaeology that states that the range of human actions and behaviors is not fixed by either nature or culture, but shaped by the interaction and dynamic of both. Hence, possibilism can be understood as a broader approach that encompasses both cultural ecology and animism, while animism is more related to religious or spiritual beliefs about the power of nature which is not necessarily tied to the concept of humans' capacity for adaptation to environment.\n\nFurthermore, animism is a belief that all objects, or even inanimate objects have consciousness or spirit that can act on the natural world.
