For example, when considering the populations of the world's major cities, many are located near coastal areas (in continental margins), such as New York, London, Shanghai, and Bangkok. However, when looking at the overall population distribution from a global perspective, it is clear that the majority of the world's population is not concentrated in such areas.\n\nHere are some general observations:\n\n1. Tropical lowlands and river valleys tend to be fertile and support dense populations due to favorable conditions for agriculture and access to water. However, they can also be prone to flooding, landslides, and other hazards that can limit population densities.\n2. Mountainous regions often have harsher climates and limited land for agriculture, reducing their population densities. However, some mountainous areas have unique niches that attract human settlement.\n3. Deserts generally have low population densities due to limited water and a challenging climate. However, certain desert regions may have specialized industries or resources that support population clusters.\n4. Continental interiors tend to have a mix of various landscapes and climate zones, with limited infrastructure due to their distance from coasts. This can influence population settlement patterns and densities.\n\nWhich factor is most relevant to world population distribution: climate, natural resources, terrain, or settlement patterns from historical periods?
