The first stage in the demographic transition model is typically characterized by high birth rates, which are driven by cultural norms that encourage large families. Additionally, this period usually experiences high variable death rates due to a lack of access to healthcare and other basic necessities. As people progress through each stage of the demographic transition model, they generally experience declines in both fertility and mortality rates. This leads to shifts in population growth patterns. For example, as countries move from Stage 1 to Stage 2, total population growth may start slowing down even if the number of births remains constant, simply because there are fewer deaths overall. Meanwhile, Stage 3 often features further reductions in both birth and death rates, leading to an aging population. In Stage 4, populations have completed the transition away from high levels of childbearing and toward low death rates, resulting in very slow population growth or even population stabilization. While this model is based on historical trends and provides a useful framework for analyzing long-term changes in global demographics, it's important to note that individual societies can experience unique variations on these general patterns depending on their specific circumstances and development pathways over time.\n\nHow did I do?

Also, migration often entails significant costs such as housing expenses and lost income from leaving oneâ€™s job which discourages people from moving solely due to negative environmental conditions.
