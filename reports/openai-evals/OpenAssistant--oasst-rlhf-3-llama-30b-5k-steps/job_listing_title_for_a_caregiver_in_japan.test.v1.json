This is because the original sentence says, \"ケアスタッフ、その他の方は、一般的に「正社員」という表現があります。\", which means that in general, people who work at facilities for the elderly are called \"full-time employees\". In this case, \" klassha-inu\" refers specifically to full-time employees who have completed nursing care worker training and passed the national examination.\n\nIn addition, although option A, \" kea sutaffu \", may seem similar on first glance, it actually does not contain the word \" full-time employee \". Option B and C, \" kea sutaffu (yosaikatsuka)\" , \" kea sutaffu (mokkatsuka)\", do not accurately convey the meaning of the original text, since these expressions include an element of being qualified or unqualified. Options E through G all include other unnecessary elements such as part-time/temporary workers and their combinations with full-time employees. Therefore they are also incorrect. Although there was no perfect match in the options provided, I judged that Option D came closest to matching the intent of the original sentence. As a result, I chose Answer D.10.\n\nI hope my explanation was helpful!
