At the center frequency of the channel. This ensures that your CW transmission occupies as little bandwidth in the 15 meters and 60 meters bands as possible, which is important considering there are many other users trying to use those bands concurrently. Choosing a different frequency than the center would mean you could potentially interfere more with other transmissions, or create undue noise on them! In addition, choosing the lowest/highest frequencies means that your transmission has less distance over what it should cover, since its energy will not propagate fully throughout the entire channel allocated for amateur radio usage. Thus, the middle (center) frequency gives you optimal coverage without interfering too much with others, while also allowing you to receive signals as best as possible given natural transmission conditions such as weather, time of day, etcetera. Finally, note that when specifying frequencies we typically give them in MHz rather than kHz - so you should actually read this question as: What is the proper place for setting my transmitter's ___ MHz for legal 60m operations? Answer: The ____MHz point in the 60 meter band. That is, 5352kHz. If you prefer thinking about wavelength then the 5MHz point corresponds to approximately 49-54m in length for the relevant portion of the HF spectrum; or more generally between approximately 8 and 17 meters per megahertz (since wavelength = speed / frequency and the speed of light is constant, this distance gets longer as either the frequency increases OR the speed remains constant), so ~22m at 60MHz.
