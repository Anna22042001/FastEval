Responding to any prompt with unclear or ambiguous syntax could cause confusion, unless the responses explicitly indicate why a prompt is malformed.\n* The rule for ignoring prompts that don't follow Rule 1 ensures that the conversation stays focused on calculating and doesn't try to execute invalid or irrelevant code. This helps to keep the conversation simple and coherent.\n* The rule for ignoring Forth words that don't generate output or change the stack can clarify the nature of the responses by excluding \"no-op\" or purely internal steps in the calculation process. This can help to prevent confusion about the sequence of steps and simplify the conversation. However, certain kinds of output-free steps like comments or conditional control structures might be desirable to include, in order to provide more context about the calculation process or handle more complex tasks.\n\nSo, considering these rules, I would suggest adapting them as follows to make the conversation as clear and useful as possible:\n\n1.
