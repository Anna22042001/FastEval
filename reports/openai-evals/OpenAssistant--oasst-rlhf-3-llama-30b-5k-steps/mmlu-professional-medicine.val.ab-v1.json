The normal AST, ALT, and haptoglobin levels suggest there is no liver damage from chronic or severe liver disease or hemolysis, and decreased UDP glucuronosyltransferase activity may cause jaundice but isn't the most likely finding in this case. An increased alkaline phosphatase level may also not be related to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, gallstones are the most likely additional finding in this patient.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA 12-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-month history of intermittent yellowing of the eyes and skin. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for jaundice. Her serum total bilirubin concentration is 3 mg/dL, with a direct component of 1 mg/dL. Serum studies show a haptoglobin concentration and AST and ALT activities that are within the reference ranges. There is no evidence of injury or exposure to toxins.

The back pain, weight loss, pulsatile masses in the left femoral area, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and pancreatic carcinoma with liver metastases and superior mesenteric artery encasement are all consistent with this diagnosis. The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome is less likely because the combination of liver metastases and superior mesenteric artery encasement from a pancreatic carcinoma is not characteristic of carcinoid tumors. Advanced malignancy, specifically pancreatic cancer, is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA 63-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of increasingly severe left leg pain and swelling of his left calf. He also has a 1-month history of increasingly severe upper midthoracic back pain. During this time, he has had a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss despite no change in appetite. He has no history of major medical illness. His only medication is ibuprofen. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 82 kg (180 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, lower extremity pulses are palpable bilaterally. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the thoracic spine shows no abnormalities. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 3-cm mass in the body of the pancreas; there are liver metastases and encasement of the superior mesenteric artery. Ultrasonography of the left lower extremity shows a femoropopliteal venous clot.
