The results showed that a democratic style of leadership was the most effective in producing high levels of worker output. In this type of leadership structure, workers are given more autonomy to make decisions about their own roles within the organization, and are also encouraged to participate in the decision making process as a whole. This creates feelings of ownership and responsibility among employees, leading them to be more invested in their jobs. This can lead to increased productivity and job satisfaction. While laissez-fair leadership may have worked best for the particular circumstances of the study population (factory workers), there is no evidence it works better than other types of leadership overall.\n\nHowever, despite these findings, it should be noted that different people respond differently to different management styles. It is important for managers to understand the needs of their team members and adapt accordingly. Also, one must consider that overtime, people might get used to an environment and achieve higher efficiency over time regardless of any changes on how they were managed. So there could always be exceptions or variables not controlled in experiments like these.

Communicator, organizer, spokesperson.\nThe three interpersonal roles of a manager as described by management theorist Richard M. Hodgetts are: figurehead, leader, and liaison (Hodgett's Three Interpersonal Roles of Management). While there is some overlap between these roles and the roles listed in the question, they are not exactly the same as those listed in any of the choices above.\nFor example:\nFigurehead - This refers to the ceremonial role that managers play as representatives of their organisation or group within it. Managers will often attend meetings or events on behalf of their company, act as official spokespeople for the firm, and sign important documents such as legal contracts. In this sense, managers act as symbolic leaders who embody what the organization stands for.\nLeader- This is concerned with how managers influence and motivate subordinates towards achieving particular goals. Leaders should have good communication skills so as to clearly explain what needs doing, why, when and how; in addition, leaders need to be able to make decisions about which course of action to take if there’re several options available; lastly, effective leaders must also possess qualities that inspire confidence and trust from their followers.\nLiaison- Liaising involves building relationships with people outside one's own unit or department. As well as representing one's own interests vis-à-vis outsiders, managers acting in this capacity must also negotiate and strike deals that benefit both parties. Successful liaison work depends heavily on good networking ability and personal charm. However, it also requires tactical awareness of when to compromise versus when to hold firm on issues.

So telecommuting includes things like: working on your laptop at home; answering emails while travelling by train; taking business calls on your mobile phone while walking in the park etc. It does not refer specifically to how much time per week someone works (i.e. whether they are full-time or part-time). It also doesn't mean simply doing occasional overtime or odd jobs outside normal hours - this would just be called 'working extra'. For these reasons, options B), C) & D) aren't quite right.
