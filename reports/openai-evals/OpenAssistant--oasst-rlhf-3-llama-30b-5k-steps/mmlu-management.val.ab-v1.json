Programmed decisions are routine decisions that are made based on established rules, procedures, or policies and occur repeatedly in a standard manner. An investment decision typically involves the allocation of resources to capitalize on opportunities for future growth and profitability, and it may be motivated by an assessment of the cost of capital, the expected cash flows of the investment, and various risk factors. The outcomes of investment decisions can be uncertain, but programmed decisions focus on routine, predictable actions rather than on uncertainty, variety, or randomness. Investment decisions are often classified as programmed decisions because they are based on established principles, theories, and methods that are known and understood. However, the actual decision may involve some level of judgment or discretion, especially if uncertainty is high or if the information is incomplete. Some programmed decisions may also involve some degree of standardization, automation, or decision support.\n\nManagement decisions typically involve planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling. Routine decisions are decisions made when facing repetitive situations in an organization or institution. They are typically standardized and require little or no analysis. Non-programmed decisions are made when facing unique or novel situations. They are not standardized and require a flexible decision-making process.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nOf what is an investment decision an example?\nA) Programmed decision\nB) Management decision\nC) Routine decision\nD) Non-programmed decision", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 23:12:52.872460+00:00"}
