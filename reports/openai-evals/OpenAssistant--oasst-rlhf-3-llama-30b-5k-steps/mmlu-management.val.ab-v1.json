Each group included boys with similar mental ages (ranging from 10 to 12 years). Each group was designated as a work group with specific roles for each member. The boys lived together for 5 consecutive days 24 hours a day. Each group was assigned one of three types of Leadership styles :Democratic,Laissez-faire, and Authoritarian, the Experiment was observed for 5 days, each day the boys would be given a different tasks. \n\nResult:\n\nDemocratic and laissez-faire leadership styles resulted in boys expressing greater confidence in their leader.\nThere was significant difference in productivity between the groups. Democratic and Laissez-Faire groups produced significantly more work than Authoritarian group, as measured by amount of shoe polish produced in the boys’ work.\n\nWhite, Lippitt, and Lewin (1939) concluded that the democratic style of leadership—which is characterized by participation of all members and group decisions made by majority rule— led to better group performance than either a laissezfaire (i.e. “hands-off”) or an autocratic (i.e. “authoritarian”) style. \n\nThe reason for this was that the democratic style motivated the group members to actively participate in their task and accept more responsibility for their group’s outcomes. The autocratic style demotivated the workers and led to passive acceptance of orders.
