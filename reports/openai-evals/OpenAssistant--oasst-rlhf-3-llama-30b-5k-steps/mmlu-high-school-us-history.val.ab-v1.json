Some notable critics included:\n\n1. Henry Clay: The American statesman and orator Henry Clay was a powerful political rival of Andrew Jackson and frequently criticized Jackson's policies, including the spoils system and Jackson's handling of banking issues. Clay was a leader of the Whig Party and was known as much for his oratory as his political prowess and leadership.\n2. John Quincy Adams: John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States, was a strong critic of Andrew Jackson. Adams was particularly vocal in his opposition to Jackson's Indian Removal Act, which forced thousands of Native Americans to relocate from their ancestral lands to areas west of the Mississippi River.\n3. Davy Crockett: Davy Crockett, the frontiersman and folk hero, originally supported Andrew Jackson but later became disillusioned with the president and fiercely opposed his Indian Removal Act.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n—Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nWhich author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?\nA) Rachel Carson in Silent Spring.\nB) Helen Hunt Jackson in A Century of Dishonor.\nC) William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator.\nD) Ralph Ellison in Invisible Man.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 22:54:53.644436+00:00"}
