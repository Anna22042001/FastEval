In order to meet this higher energy demand, aerobic energy production is increased as aerobic metabolic pathways can generate ATP more efficiently and quickly than anaerobic pathways. The aerobic energy production pathway, which relies on oxygen for ATP production during exercise, includes the electron transport chain (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). These pathways generate ATP by transferring electrons through a series of complexes in the mitochondria, using the energy released from the electron transport chain to pump protons against a gradient, which generates ATP.\n\nOn the other hand, anaerobic energy production, which takes place in the absence of oxygen, includes processes such as glycolysis and the phosphagen system. These pathways generate ATP rapidly, but the amounts of ATP produced are much smaller compared to aerobic energy production, and they lead to the production of lactic acid as a byproduct, which can accumulate and cause fatigue and discomfort during exercise. Thus, the higher the intensity of exercise, the greater the proportional contribution of aerobic energy production and the electron transfer chain in particular.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIn general, the higher the intensity of exercise, the greater the proportional contribution of:\nA) the electron transfer chain to the production of ATP.\nB) the TCA cycle (Krebs' cycle) to the production of ATP.\nC) anaerobic energy production.\nD) aerobic energy production.", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 21:53:55.108468+00:00"}

Trypsinogen is an enzyme that helps break down proteins into smaller segments during digestion. If a lack of trypsinogen is present, it can lead to limited protein absorption and increased fat malabsorption. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is often used to treat cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. PERT is composed of a mixture of lipases, proteases, and amylases, which help break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Elastinogen, Carboxypeptidase, and lipase are additional enzymes involved in digestion but without a single elastinogen, the effects of the lack of enzyme activity would not lead to such an extensive effect on nutrients absorption. Therefore, the correct answer is: Trypsinogen. (Cystic Fibrosis Research Inc. (CFRI), 2018)\n\nIt is also worth noting that cystic fibrosis patients tend to have compromised health and their bodies are not able to absorb nutrients properly, leading to malnutrition over time. There are also often complications that come alongside the disease, such as CF-related diabetes. This disease happens because the CFTR protein doesn't work correctly, as a side-effect of CF-related nutrition; and it is influenced by pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. (Ramsey, B. W. & Davies, J.
