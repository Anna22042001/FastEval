Cells in the body of an adult human being undergo about 10 quadrillion cell divisions in a lifetime. The human genome is composed of 22 pairs of autosomes, plus two sex chromosomes, for a total of 24. Hence there are 22 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes per diploid genome, or 22+2=24 chromosomes per somatic genome. During the S phase of the cell cycle, the 24 chromosomes in each chromosome pair are replicated and become 48 chromosomes. The DNA sequence that is replicated is composed of a sequence of about 3 billion nucleotides, and it is replicated once per cell cycle. There is a constraint that ensures that each new chromosome contains one member of each pair of sister chromatids. Hence, there are 24 chromosomes prior to cell division, and there will be 48 chromosomes after each one has divided into two sister chromatids, which become individual chromosomes when pulled apart during cell division. This leaves 96 chromosomes after two rounds of cell division, or 24*4, which is the number of chromosomes in 4 daughter diploid cells.
