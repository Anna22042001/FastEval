The fastest and most powerful muscle fibers in the human body, type I (or slow twitch), have a high endurance capacity because they contain higher mitochondrial density for energy production and greater capillary densities compared to other fiber types allowing them to perform repetitive contractions over extended periods without becoming exhausted easily. Slow twitch fibers also possess lower levels of myoglobin which allows less oxygen consumption by these fibers during aerobic metabolism resulting in greater efficiency at using oxygen efficiently to generate ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation pathways. In contrast, anaerobic energy generation results from glycolysis is more rapid and occurs in fast twitch fibers and results in a lot of lactic acid accumulation that may cause fatigue, soreness or cramps due to irritation or stress on muscles, blood vessels, tendons or ligaments. Thus, sprinting will primarily use up type IIx fibers whereas marathon running would use more type I fibers although some amount of both are involved in either event. Fast Twitch Fibers can be further subdivided into two categories based on their speed – intermediate (Type IIa) and fast (type IIb). Intermediate fibers express characteristics between slow and fast twitch fibers, while fast fibers exhibit properties closer to fast twitch fibers, but slightly slower. Since these distinctions exist along a continuum, physiologists refer to “fast” versus “slow” twitch muscle fibers rather than categorizing individual fibers as strictly one type or another.

All of these factors are necessary except for supplying oxygen to working muscles because while it does help to have good cardio function, this is primarily about increasing capillary density so as to increase blood flow which helps deliver nutrients/remove waste faster, and increases oxygen delivery via red cells. Increasing Vo2 max will only take you so far - at some point maximizing mitochondrial efficiency and glycolysis/fuel metabolism becomes more important than just being able to consume oxygen. There's also a diminishing marginal return with respect to how much Vo2max can be increased through training alone; there seems to be a natural limit beyond which further improvements become very difficult without other interventions like EPO, altitude training, etc. On the other hand, improving glycolytic capacity by doing lots of hard interval work can pay big dividends even after most individuals reach their Vo2max plateau.
