You would need to be able to hop to progress to skipping.\n\nEven though all of the skills listed may help to achieve the ability to skip, hopping is the key fundamental progression.\n\nAs for running, you should be able to already skip before you try running.  If you learn to skip without ever running, will you ever need to use that skill?  Although running is a vital skill, and important component of an active lifestyle, it is not a skill you need to learn how to skip.\n\nLearning to walk backwards, as well as the ability to do the motion known as crab walking, are important components to achieving proper form in certain activities like gymnastics.  However again, these skills are advanced progressions that build off of the fundamental ability to skip. If you cannot skip, you will not be able to achieve proper walking backwards, nor will you be able to do crab walking properly.\n\nThe ability to hop will also help you with higher level activities like skiing, and snowboarding, as well as many other sports that involve quick lateral movements.\n\nTherefore, hopping is the key fundamental skill. Although it will take more skills to achieve the full form of skipping, hopping is the core skill that will allow you to do so, and will also help in many other areas, like the sports mentioned above, or even something as seemingly unrelated as jumping in line. Because of that, hopping is the key fundamental progression necessary to eventually skipping properly.\n\nBy the way, don’t forget,  it’s important to learn these skills safely:  as you practice, it’s important to focus on learning proper form, in order to minimize risk of injury.
