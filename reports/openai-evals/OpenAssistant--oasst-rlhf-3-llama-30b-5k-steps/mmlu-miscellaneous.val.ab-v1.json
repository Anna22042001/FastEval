To completely fill the volume of one floor, you would need around 371 such balloons (((4.1 m/floor) * (100 floors/building)) * pi x 2^2 = 371,000). The total number of floors in the Empire State Building is 102, but we'll round down to 100 for simplicity. So the total number of balloons you'd need would be:\n\n371,000 / 100 floors per building = 3,710 balloons per floor\n3,710 x 100 floors = 371,200 balloons\n\nTherefore around 371,000 - 371,200 balloons. Dividing the balloons required for one floor by the area (4.1 m x 4.1 m) shows that the average balloon in a tower would need to be around twice as tall as the actual building to fully fill the volume of one floor (4,656m compared to 1,250m). This is why only 371000 - 371200 balloons are required.\n\nThat's not physically possible with an uninflated, air-filled balloon and a tactic could be to just inflate the balloons to be half the size of a floor each.
