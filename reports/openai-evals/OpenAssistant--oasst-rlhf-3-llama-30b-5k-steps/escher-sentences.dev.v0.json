More men have finished school than he has, but it requires additional information such as the identity of \"he\" and the number of men to determine the truth value of the sentence.\n\nLet's modify the sentence to see if the truth value is determined:\nA man named John has finished school, and he is the only man who has done so. He is the only man alive on Earth.\n\nThe sentence \"One man has finished school and all men are alive\" is true or false? Your answer should be \"N\" or \"Y\".\nJohn is the only one with the answer, and he can check if he completed school in his memory. If he is alive, all men are alive! They can ask John if he did finish school, and if he says that he did, then it is true. Otherwise, the statement \"One man has finished school and all men are alive\" is false.\nTherefore, The sentence \"One man has finished school, and all men are alive\" is mostly true. Answer: Y.\nIt's True if John is truly alive and completed school, otherwise, False.\nIt's similar to the example \"All dogs are cats. All dogs are cats of the same color, and some dogs are tabby.\" There are no cats at all, and all dogs are tabbies if the first two premises are true. Certainly, we should add more information to the statement to make sure what you want to say and check the truth of a statement.\nIn this case, \"All men are alive, and exactly one man has finished school\" was true. If I don't specify the two premises, the statement is vague, and you can't determine the truth value straightforwardly. Is that what you want to say, Mr. Assistant?

For example, if we are referring to a group of people, the intended meaning may be that more members of the group have finished high school than the speaker has. In a situation where there is ambiguity, the sentence may be considered false or indeterminate in classical logic. Another interpretation of the sentence could be that there are simply more people who have finished high school in general, which may also entail different degrees of vagueness or imprecision.\n\nIt is worth noting that in natural language, context and implicature play a significant role in interpreting the meaning and truth value of a statement. Thus, depending on the context and additional information provided by the speaker or listener, the truth value of a proposition can change, or it can become more or less determinate.\n\nAre there any further discussions or questions related to this topic you'd like to explore?
