But for simplicity's sake I would say that Derek died during fall or autumn as we call it in North America. His death came at the end of the fall sweeps period which is when television networks air special episodes with higher production values and stunt casting etc... hoping to draw more viewers so they can charge advertisers more money per viewer. Shonda Rhimes killed him off to boost ratings so he wasn't really dead but then she killed Mark Sloan too just because she could I guess or maybe TPTB told her to do it who knows either way. He was the best character by far and his death marked the beginning of the end of my interest in Grey's Anatomy as Meredith became increasingly insufferable and Cristina Yang left after season ten and Owen Hunt started being an absolute twat too.
