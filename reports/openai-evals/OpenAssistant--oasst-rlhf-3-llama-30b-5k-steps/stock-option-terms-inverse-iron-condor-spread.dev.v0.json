A covered call involves selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call on stock you own, while a bull put spread entails buying an OTM put and simultaneously writing another OTM put with a lower exercise/strike price to offset the cost of the first put. This combination effectively lowers the net debit paid for entering the position and limits potential losses, but also caps profit potential. In this case, the trader could potentially earn premium income from both options sales ($5.88 + $13.4 = $19.28 total credit received). If the stock price remains above $262.5 by expiration, they would keep the credits as profit. However, if it drops below either $240 or $250, they may be assigned on those positions and forced to buy/sell shares at unfavorable prices or roll over the short puts. On the other hand, if the stock rallies significantly past $262.5, they will miss out on any upside beyond that point since their written call has been exercised and they now have to sell the underlying stock at $262.5 regardless of its market value. So there's risk involved, which is why proper selection of strikes and timing is critical for success when implementing these strategies.
