In a convergent world, information can be delivered through any number of channels: books, magazines, radio, television, telephone, computers, compact discs, VHS tapes, MP3 players, podcasts, blog posts, websites, webinars, and more. For example, instead of reading this on paper as you would have had to do ten years ago or even listening to an audio version of this article from your local library over a decade before that (if such a recording existed), you can now read this online at home while streaming a video of last night’s episode of The Office and chatting about both items simultaneously on Facebook. This convergence has affected not only how we receive news but also what type of stories get covered; traditional journalism no longer holds a monopoly on creating newsworthy content or shaping public opinion. Instead of relying solely on major print or broadcast outlets such as CNN or The New York Times, individuals and organizations across the political spectrum create content and distribute it directly to audiences on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+, Flickr, Blogger, Medium, WordPress, and other social media platforms — most of which didn’t exist just five years ago.
