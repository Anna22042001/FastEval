When a high-energy electron collides with a metal atom, it can ionize the atom by removing one or more electrons from its outer shell. This leaves vacancies in the outer shell, which can be filled by electrons from higher-energy shells. As the electrons from higher-energy shells move down to fill the vacancies, they leave behind new vacancies in their former shells. This process continues, with the vacancies cascading down through the shells until they reach the innermost shell, called the K shell.\n\nWhen the K shell becomes ionized, the resulting vacancy can only be filled by an electron that has been promoted from an outer shell. However, the energy required to excite an electron from an outer shell to fill the vacant K-shell position is specific and fixed, depending on the metal atom in question. When the excited electron fills the vacant K-shell position, it returns to its ground state by emitting an X-ray photon with an energy equal to the difference between the energy of the initial vacancy in the K shell and the energy of the excited state of the electron that filled it.\n\nTherefore, characteristic X-rays are produced when high-energy electrons bombard a metal target as a result of electrons filling inner shell vacancies that are created in the metal atoms.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nCharacteristic X rays, appearing as sharp lines on a continuous background, are produced when high-energy electrons bombard a metal target.
