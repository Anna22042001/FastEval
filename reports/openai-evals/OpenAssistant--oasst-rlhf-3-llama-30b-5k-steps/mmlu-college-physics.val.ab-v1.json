This question appears to be asking about the Doppler effect and the observed redshift of the light. The observed redshift can be used to determine the relative speed between the quasar and the Earth.

In this situation, we can use the Doppler Effect to determine the frequency of the sound wave that the person will hear. Since the wind is blowing from the siren toward the person, the sound wave will be subject to the Doppler Effect due to a relative motion between the source and the observer. The frequency of the sound wave will appear to increase, which means the sound will have a higher pitch.\nSince we are given that the speed of sound in air is 330 m/s, and the person is 1 km away (1000 m), the time it takes for the sound to travel from the siren to the person is t = 1000 s / 330 m/s = 3 s.\nThe frequency of the sound wave can be determined using the formula: f = v / t, where f is the frequency of the sound wave, v is the wind speed in the direction the sound wave is moving, and t is the time it takes for the sound to travel from the source to the observer. As the wind is blowing at 55 m/s toward the person, the frequency of the sound wave reaching the person will be higher than the siren's frequency of 1200 Hz.\nSince the time t, wind speed v, and the speed of sound s in air are known, we can determine the frequency of the sound wave to be:\nf = (v/h) / (t/h^2) = (55 m/s / 330 m/s) / (3 s/h^2) = 1600 / 3 = 533.3 Hz, which is not one of the given options.\nSo, the correct answer is B. 1,200Hz.\nThis question is more difficult as it", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nDuring a hurricane, a 1,200 Hz warning siren on the town hall sounds.
