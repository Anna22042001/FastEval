Pro bono publico (in the public good; for the common weal) is a Latin phrase used in English to mean \"for the public good,\" and is rarely used independently of its original legal context except to indicate an action performed voluntarily, without charge. Although most pro bono work is undertaken within the legal profession, it can also be performed outside of law as a means of benefitting society rather than oneself or one's own interests. For example, volunteers who help out at homeless shelters and soup kitchens perform pro bono community service. In general, however, this term has particular connotations of social responsibility taken on willingly by members of the bar. The first recorded use of the term \"pro bono\" was in 1790, when it appeared in the United States Statutes at Large under the Act to Provide Compensation for the Services of Attorneys, which authorized federal judges to request attorneys licensed in their respective states to appear before them on behalf of persons unable to employ counsel. As such, legal professionals may sometimes take on cases pro bono for individuals who cannot afford legal representation or whose case might otherwise go unrepresented due to lack of funds—that is, they work for free. Organizations that provide free legal representation to those unable to afford it are called \"public defender organizations.\" Most U.S.-based law schools require their students to supply a minimum number of hours of pro bono services prior to graduation.
