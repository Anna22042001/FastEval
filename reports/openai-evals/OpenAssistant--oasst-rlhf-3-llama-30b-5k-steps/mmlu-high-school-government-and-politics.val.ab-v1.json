Although all choices listed may receive some donations, by far, political interest and ideological groups tend to collect the most cash, at around 60-70% of the total.\n\nSince PACs may collect many large checks, and collect money from across the country, it is possible, if not likely for candidates, especially incumbents, to get more direct and concentrated donations. However, these tend to be smaller checks and fewer in total, which would make it far less likely for incumbents to top the list of receiving entities.\n\nI chose C) Federal judges as the most unlikely of all the listed entities to receive a lot of money, because they have neither influence over nor access to much campaign cash. While it’s possible that some judges could gain benefit from special interest money, it will almost always be tied to some influence over the case that judge will handle. This does not benefit those who actually decide the cases which often involve the special interests. Although there is some influence over the cases where the judges sit since campaigns can make it more influential through campaign donations, it’s most likely to lead to more ideological appointment of judges, if a judge is even eligible for re-election, than a change in the specific candidates decided by these appointers (i.e. through fundraising and support).\n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer to the question, “Which group most frequently benefits from political action committee (PAC) donations?” is A) Political interest groups.
