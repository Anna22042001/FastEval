According to the seller at Amazon, and if my translation is correct, it is 42 millimeters by 47 millimeters by 32.6 millimeters, and it weighs 0.309 grams. The number 192 appears later on in the product description, and I do not know if it represents 192 grams or a different unit of measure, but I do know this motor is not 192 grams. A review on this page (accessed 2023-03-03) says the weight is about 110 grams, and the product page gives \"Net weight: 309 grams.\"\n\nI also did the rough math to see if 118 grams can be turned into 192 grams, and the motor would need to be about 50.8 millimeters wide or 72.2 millimeters tall. My understanding is that to convert millimeters to gram, you need to know the cross section of the metal or material you are dealing with. It is worth noting that when converting a volume into mass, I can use the density of water, which has a density of approximately one gram per cubic centimeter.\n\nTo summarize my research and answer, I believe there is no motor with a known and reported weight of exactly 192 grams, and rounding the Sy42sth47-12", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are to answer each given question with a single number, with no extra characters or units.
