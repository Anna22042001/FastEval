It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nBased on Huizinga's description of Erasmus's career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of\nA) Christine de Pisan\nB) Johannes Gutenberg\nC) Martin Luther\nD) Francesco Petrarch", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:23:34.620291+00:00"}

This option is incorrect because it suggests that wage inequality decreased during the Industrial Revolution when the opposite is true. While real wages did rise overall due to increased productivity and demand for labor, this benefit was not shared equally between capitalists/employers and workers. Employers captured much of the gains from higher output per worker as profits, leaving workers to compete for jobs and therefore unable to negotiate significantly better pay or working conditions. This led to continued disparities in income and power between the two classes. Option B is also incorrect because it presents evidence of continuity rather than change: the statement says \"persisted\" instead of \"developed.\" Although pre-industrial agrarian societies had dominant landholding elites who held political and economic power, there were already substantial peasant or yeoman populations whose wealth came mainly from farming. Over time these patterns evolved and took new forms within both urban and rural contexts. Thus the dominance of agricultural elites did not necessarily arise from the same sources throughout history nor inevitably endure forever.Option D is incorrect because labor unions did exist before the late 19th century Luddite movement. For example, craft guilds in medieval times often limited entry into certain trades, ensuring higher prices could be charged and protecting members' interests. More broadly speaking, human beings have long organized themselves collectively around common goals or identities based on factors like kinship, religion, ethnicity, occupation, etc. Unions just represent one specific form this impulse takes under capitalist economies where employer-employee relations create opportunities for conflict and cooperation alike.

[and] if called upon to grapple with problems demanding severe intellectual effort, we fear [she] might fail.\" Moreover, while \"[t]he training of youth requires patience, firmness, justice, uprightness, truthfulness, decision of character, and power to command,\" these characteristics, though valuable in teaching children, do not necessarily translate to success at managing a household. Therefore, when considering the various domestic roles available to them, \"[i]f a lady possess these qualities in a marked degree, she should certainly adopt teaching as a profession.\" (Source: The Young Idea by Anthony Trollope.)\n\nThe implication here seems to be that since men have superior reasoning faculties and powers of application compared to women, men would therefore be better able to manage a school. However, this does not mean that Beeton did not value education for girls - quite the contrary! She thought that a good understanding of domestic economy was necessary for every girl, whether rich or poor, and recommended that \"every parent who desires to give his daughter a truly useful education must resolutely refuse to conform to the popular notion of confining her studies to what is usually termed 'accomplishments'.\" Instead, he must provide her with a sound education that includes \"such branches of learning as are indispensable to her future usefulness as a companion, a mother, and a manager of a household.\" (Source: The Book of Household Management, Part I., Chapter II., Section III.)

The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n—Report of the Estates of Normandy, 1651\nWhich of the following intellectual movements was occurring in Europe at the time this document was created and would help improve crop yields?\nA) The rise of existentialism\nB) Divine Right theory of rule\nC) The Scientific Revolution\nD) The Enlightenment", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:25:38.963549+00:00"}
