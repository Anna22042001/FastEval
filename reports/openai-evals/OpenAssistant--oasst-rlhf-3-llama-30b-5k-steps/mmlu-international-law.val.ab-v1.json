In contrast, the Court noted that any measures taken must comply with the principles of necessity and proportionality; therefore, while some scholars argue there may be a limited right of self-defense without reference to the territorial sovereign or UN Security Council approval, these are still subject to strict legal constraints. Some scholars further contend that even if a successful act of terrorism does not trigger article 51, this should not imply that a victim state cannot take military action. Under customary international law, every state has the inherent right to defend itself; therefore, if one accepts that suicide bombers could use weapons of mass destruction (WMD), then a threatened state would have the legal authority to preemptively strike at such non-state actors before they launched their planned attacks. The key question becomes whether states facing new threats are legally empowered to respond proportionately through the use of force consistent with the relevant rules of ius ad bellumand ius in belloorwhether only diplomatic protests are appropriate once WMDs become involved on either side of a conflict.
