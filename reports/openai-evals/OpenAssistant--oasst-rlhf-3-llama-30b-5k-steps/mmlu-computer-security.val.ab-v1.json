Anti-virus scanners are designed to detect and remove viruses or malicious code from a system. However, Heartbleed does not involve the injection of any code into the system, but rather exploits a vulnerability in the system to steal sensitive information. Hence, anti-virus scanners would not have detected an exploitation of Heartbleed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Heartbleed attacks the SSL/TLS protocol used for secure communication, not the anti-virus scanner. Option B is also incorrect because Heartbleed exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SSL/TLS protocol to leak sensitive information from the system. Option C is incorrect because anti-virus scanners typically look for a wide range of threats beyond just viruses, including malicious code and vulnerabilities. However, anti-virus scanners focus on detecting and removing threats that have already entered the system, whereas Heartbleed exploits the system from the inside by abusing a legitimate feature of the SSL/TLS protocol.
