Standing waves exist when two waves of equal amplitude interfere in a way that the net displacement at a particular point remains constant (that is, the two waves are in phase).

In between the nodes are points of minimum displacement—the antinodes—where the pressure is minimal. Standing waves are formed when two or more waves meet, and the wave interference causes them to appear to stand still at some locations.\n\nThese phenomena are also described by saying that waves reflect upon themselves. When the original wave conditions are identical to that of the reflected wave, the latter is called a standing wave, which is a type of stationary wave.\n\nAlthough the description of standing waves is usually given as an explanation for musical instruments, the same physics applies to any resonating system, such as a mechanical device that amplifies and transmits oscillation, e.g., the doubling of force in a lever, thus making it a form of mechanical resonance.\n\nThere is also a phenomenon called standing waves which exist due to wave interference, which may arise in several circumstances:\n\n* As sound waves reflecting from a wall, they combine to form a standing wave in the theatre.\n* Standing waves in transmission lines, such as when a source is placed at one end of a uniform transmission line.\n\nIn the case of musical instruments, standing waves occur by allowing a set of waves to interfere with themselves as they bounce back and forth between two free boundaries; in acoustics, these boundaries are termed \"resonators\".
