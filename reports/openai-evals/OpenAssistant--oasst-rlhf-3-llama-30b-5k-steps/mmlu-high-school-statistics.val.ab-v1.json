Each item has a chip somewhere inside. Upon checkout, the chip is deactivated so the scanner will not set off the alarm. The scanner has a 98% chance of detecting an active chip (meaning the material has not been checked out) and setting off the alarm. The scanner also has a 3% chance of sounding the alarm when someone passes through without an active chip. It is estimated that 0.5% of library customers actually try to leave the library with an active chip.
