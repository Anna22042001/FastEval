But I don't know much about his political beliefs beyond what everyone knows: He wanted government small enough that it couldn't get into anyone's business and prevent them from doing things like selling stock on margin during bubbles, and people thought more highly of government then than they do now. So perhaps we should view Coolidge as someone who didn't fit comfortably into either party but did have views that were consistent enough for someone in our era to try to put their feet into his shoes and write up a platform based around those principles.\n\nSo yes, Coolidge was also pro-life, and I can certainly understand why a lot of Republicans might find such an ideology appealing today, even though it has become associated with evangelical Christianity.
