The `alert` function in JavaScript will not display a \"security warning box,\" in fact, it will display a pop-up alert box directly on the user's browser, which the user can interact with.\n\nBecause the `alert` function in JavaScript cannot be blocked reliably, it should not be seen as a reliable way to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The proper way to protect against XSS attacks is to properly encode user input, and use a security library like HTMLPurifier. In addition, regular security testing, such as performing a web application firewall (WAF) bypass test, is critical for properly securing web applications.\n\nI apologize for not noticing this myself when I wrote the answer, and I will do my best to catch factual inaccuracies like this when writing in the future."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-18 22:21:36.238629+00:00"}
