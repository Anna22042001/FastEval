Therefore, the energy needs of a sedentary person will be lower compared to an active person.\n\nThere are several factors that can influence the energy needs of an individual, including age, sex, weight, and activity level. In general, as individuals grow older, their energy needs tend to decrease.

Additionally, women tend to have lower energy needs than men, even when they have the same weight and activity level. Your energy needs are also influenced by your weight, as a person who weighs more requires more energy to maintain body functions compared to a person who weighs less. Finally, activity level has a significant influence on energy needs, because the energy used for physical activity such as exercise or daily activities like walking or climbing stairs is not taken into account when we calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).\n\nThe Harris-Benedict equation is a widely used equation to calculate BMR but, as pointed out there is a newer and more exact equation to predict the energy needs, which include sedentary, moderate or light physical activity.

Fat is a more efficient source of energy than carbohydrates, providing almost twice as many calories per gram as protein or carbohydrates.\n3. Cell signalling: Dietary fat plays an important role in cell signalling. The fatty acids found in dietary fat are converted into hormone-like compounds known as eicosanoids.
