Dietary fat has multiple functions, including forming part of cellular membranes, providing energy to the body, and participating in cell signaling processes. Therefore, all of the options provided are correct.\n\nFat is an essential nutrient that is necessary for maintaining overall health and wellbeing, as it serves several important purposes in the body. Here are some overview of the functions of dietary fat:\n\nForms Part of Cellular Membranes:\nFat helps form the membranes of all cells in the body. These membranes control what goes into and out of cells. Membrane fluidity is important for cell function as well, and fats help maintain this fluidity. Cells need the right amount of fluidity to move and function properly.\n\nProvides Energy:\nFat is a rich source of energy. When the body breaks down fat, it releases energy. Fat stores energy in the form of fatty acids. The body uses these fatty acids for energy. Fats can help supply energy over long periods of time. When you are not eating for a long time, fats help maintain energy levels.\n\nCell Signaling:\nCells use fats to make hormones. Hormones are the body’s chemical messengers. Hormones send messages between cells. Fats help regulate and stimulate cell function. They help regulate how cells make proteins and duplicate. When fats are part of a hormone, they are called hormone precursors. Hormone precursors become converted to hormones once they enter the circulation.\n\nIn addition to the functions listed above, fats also play important roles in nutrient absorption, vitamin transport, hormone production, skin health, and brain function.
