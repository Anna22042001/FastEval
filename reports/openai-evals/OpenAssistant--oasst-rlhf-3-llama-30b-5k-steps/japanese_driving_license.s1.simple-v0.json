So just because you have a normal drivers license does not mean that you can legally drive all types of tow trucks. In fact most tow truck operators only allow certified drivers to operate their equipment due to insurance liabilities. They do not want rookies damaging their expensive equipment nor causing accidents which could result in lawsuits against them. But even if you get a special \"commercial vehicle\" endorsement added onto your license , you still might need additional certifications depending on the company you work for , the type of vehicles being towed , and location of operation . Some states require certain levels of experience / hours worked + classroom study credits along with written tests or skills demonstrations performed in person . While other places allow individuals to self-certify once they feel confident enough behind the wheel without requiring much oversight by local governments or businesses employers . Of course there are also private companies who offer training courses too in case anyone wants extra practice outside of whatever requirements happen to", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a examinee taking driving license exam in Japan.
