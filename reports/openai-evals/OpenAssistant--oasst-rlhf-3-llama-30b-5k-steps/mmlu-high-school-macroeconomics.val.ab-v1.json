However, the spending multiplier is often smaller than predicted because of rising prices, which can lead to a decrease in net exports as foreigners are less likely to buy goods and services from the country due to the decrease in their purchasing power.\n\nThis is because a decrease in the value of a country's currency due to rising prices can make its exports more expensive for foreign buyers, and decrease the demand for its exports. This decrease in net exports can counteract the expansionary effects of the fiscal policy, resulting in a smaller multiplier effect than anticipated.\n\nOption (B) lower taxes is a possible reason for the multiplier effect, as lower taxes can increase disposable income and lead to an increase in consumption.

In the short run, firms cannot easily change their physical capital and labor inputs, so they must produce at existing capacity.\n2. LRAS (Long-Run Aggregate Supply) curve: This curve shows the level of real output that can be produced in the long run, when firms can adjust the capital stock and labor inputs to match the demand for goods and services. In the long run, the LRAS curve is vertical because the economy's total supply is determined by its long-run aggregate production function.\n3. Production possibility curve (PPC): This curve shows all possible combinations of two goods or services that can be produced by an economy given its resources, technology, and fixed inputs. The PPC is bowed outward, assuming that the production of one good requires inputs in excess of those required to produce the other good.\n\nNow, let's examine the answer choices:\n\nA) Increase in the SRAS curve: We can eliminate this choice because an increase in the SRAS curve represents a decrease in supply (i.e., a movement along the SRAS curve to the left), which would lead to higher prices and possibly lower output levels. This does not correspond to economic growth, which involves an increase in aggregate output.\n\nB) Increase in the LRAS curve: We can eliminate this choice as well.
