National income refers to the sum of income earned by factors of production (e.g., labor and capital) from engaging in productive activities; since GDP includes government spending on purchases such as military weapons that do not directly contribute to private consumption or investment (i.e., they are not part of \"national income\"), these may be regarded as subtracted from national income before being added back into GDP.

In this scenario, there would be too much aggregate demand (spending and investment), causing prices to rise and creating an excess amount of production compared to what was initially planned for full employment. This will result in an increase in real GDP as well as an increase in the price level. The difference between actual GDP and potential GDP represents unused resources or economic slack which results from the fact that the economy cannot immediately respond fully to changes in demand without incurring costs of adjustments to resource allocation - it takes time for firms to react by increasing their capital stocks (e.g., buildings, equipment). As such, the term \"inflationary gap\" refers to the period where nominal output exceeds real output capacity i.e. effective production rate of goods/services per unit time. Since the total number of inputs used are still equal to the full employment levels, but their productivity has decreased due to higher than intended price levels, we can say that part of labor input remains underutilized during this period. That's why this concept is also known as \"output gap\" or \"underutilization.\" It causes both price pressures (or general increase in all individual prices, not just of few specific commodities) and a higher unemployment rate than the natural rate (which corresponds to the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). For these reasons, economists generally recommend avoiding sustained significant inflationary gaps, since they contribute to worsening inflation rate over longer periods, whereas the short-term negative effects on economic performance like the unemployment rate may be countered by monetary stabilization policy.

Increased government spending during periods of underemployment can stimulate aggregate demand, increase production levels, and boost real GDP growth. This option maximizes the impact on output by addressing both supply-side factors (unused resources/labour) as well as overall economic demand. Tax cuts or reductions are not necessary for this effect; instead, increasing government expenditure directly addresses unutilized capital and labour inputs without relying solely on changes in consumer behaviour. An increase in government spending would be more effective than merely cutting taxes if there is excess capacity in the economy because firms need confidence to invest before hiring new workers; therefore, increased public outlays may encourage private investors to follow suit.

For example, temporary income support combined with public infrastructure projects and business tax credits could improve short-term economic prospects effectively. Ultimately, though, there is debate over how large these effects might be since actual multipliers depend strongly on initial conditions and other external shocks like monetary policy decisions; thus, the best solution requires careful calibration based on real-time data analysis.

The existence of both absolute and comparative advantage is necessary for this process to occur, as it ensures that each country will be able to focus on producing the goods it does best while importing those that are cheaper from the other country. The option D is incorrect since increasing marginal returns refer to the increase in output associated with an additional unit of input used in a production process as you add more units of input. But this concept doesn't relate directly to international trade and specialization like absolute and comparative advantage do. Option B and C only mentions one aspect either the comparative or absolute advantage but not both which makes them incomplete in explaining how specialization and trade benefits both parties involved.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following must exist to allow for mutual benefit from specialization and trade between two countries?\nA) Absolute and comparative advantage in the production of a good or service\nB) Comparative advantage in the production of a good or service\nC) Absolute advantage in the production of a good or service\nD) Increasing marginal returns in production", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:36:34.133819+00:00"}
