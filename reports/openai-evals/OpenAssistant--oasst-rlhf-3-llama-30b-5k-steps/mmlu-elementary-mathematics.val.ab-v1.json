This can be simplified as: 40x(5+2)=80. While the other options are not equivalent, they can still evaluate to 80 if calculated correctly. However, only option A involves multiplying 5 and 2 first before multiplying by 8, which makes it the most efficient method for arriving at the given result of 80 in one step. It also matches the order of operations, PEMDAS, where multiplication comes before addition. Therefore, option C would need parentheses added around (5x2), so it could be considered equivalent if changed to C) ((5x8)x2).\n\nAs a side note, option B cannot evaluate to 80 because when adding like terms in algebra or arithmetic, you must keep the same exponent on any variable being raised to a power. For example, 3^2=9 but 3+(1/2)^2 = 9 (if we assume 1/2^2 is equal to -4, then this simplifies to 7+(-4)=-3). So in option B, it would become (5*-4)+(5*2), which equals -20. If instead you meant to use parentheses to raise 5 to an exponent, that's a different story altogether! Then option B would simplify to (-8)(-4)+(-8)*2=16, assuming powers work in a way similar to exponents on negative numbers such as sqrt(-16). With complex numbers, this may make more sense; i.e. (-2)^3 is defined as (-2)(-2)(-2)=+8 using de Moivre's formula.
