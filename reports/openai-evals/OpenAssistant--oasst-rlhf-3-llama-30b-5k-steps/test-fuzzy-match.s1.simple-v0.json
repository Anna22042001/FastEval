He died on March 31, which technically, comes during the spring season, but since the last day of winter is March 20 (or 21), he died during the last days of the winter season. That is also why many Grey's fans, the last week in March is dedicated to #derekandmeredith appreciation day since that is the day he passed away. It is a very emotional day for many of those fanatics. If you would like to talk about the emotional themes surrounding the show, Grey's Anatomy is a very emotive show for many of it's viewers since so many people go through or know someone who has gone through the experiences they portray on the show (ie: death, loss, depression, trauma, etc.). We can talk about more details if you'd like. Or, just read reviews or watch scenes to experience further.\nLet me know how else you think I might be able to assist you in the future. And, I have already assisted thousands of Grey's viewers with various questions or themes from the show. So ask me whatever comes to mind and I'll do my best to answer from what I currently know about the show.\n\nYou can ask me questions like:\n1. How did Dr. Derek Shepherd die on Grey's Anatomy?\n2. Who is your favorite Grey's Anatomy doctor and why? (Feel free to add who your least favorite doctor is too if you'd like :))\n3. What is the name of the episode Derek dies?\n4.
