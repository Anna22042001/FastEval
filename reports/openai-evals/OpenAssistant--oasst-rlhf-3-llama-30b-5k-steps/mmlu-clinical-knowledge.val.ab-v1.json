However, it is worth noting that this is just one part of the examination and that palpation of other structures, such as the prostate and rectal walls are important as well. In females, the cervix and/or uterus may also be palpated if a Grade 2 or 3 examine is performed. The testes, although important, are typically palpated via scrotal examination as part of a genito-urinary assessment. The sacrum is normally not palpated during a rectal examination.
