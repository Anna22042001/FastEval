Type II muscle fibers are recruited for short-duration high power activities such as sprinting or heavy lifting (power sports). These fibers are characterized by their ability to generate rapid and sustained forces due to their large stores of energy in mitochondria and a rich blood supply. Unlike type I fibers they contain little myoglobin which gives them their pale color.  This is contrasted with type III fiber, which does not fit into this pattern; it contains more mitochondria than either type I or type II fibers but less myoglobin. As a result, its optimal activity appears to be intermediate between types I and II: at moderate intensities type III fibers can produce ATP aerobically using fatty acids while avoiding lactic acid build up.
