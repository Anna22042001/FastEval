Answer: Maine.\n\nFerdinand Johann Wilhelm Carl Joseph von Savigny was a German jurist and legal scholar who is most closely associated with the development of the historical school of law. This school of thought believed that the legal principles and institutions of a nation should be based on the unique historical and cultural traditions of that nation rather than on universally applicable principles. In other words, Savigny believed that law was not a separate and independent system that could be studied and understood apart from its historical context.\n\nHenry Maine was an English legal scholar who is best known for his work on the historical development of law and for his emphasis on the importance of social and economic factors in shaping legal institutions. Maine was particularly interested in the comparative study of law and was one of the first scholars to examine the legal systems of different nations in order to identify patterns and commonalities across cultures and time periods.\n\nBoth Savigny and Maine were important figures in the evolution of legal thought, but Maine is generally regarded as the first jurist to systematically study the comparative aspect of law. Answer: B) Maine.\n\nJohn Austin is another influential legal scholar who is known for his work on the philosophy of law. Austin developed the theory of legal positivism, which holds that law is a social command backed by threats of punishment, and he is often associated with the analytical school of jurisprudence.\n\nHans Kelsen was a legal scholar who is best known for his work on public international law and for developing the theory of pure theory of law. Kelsen believed that law was a formal system of norms that could be independently derived from logical and conceptual considerations, and he sought to ground the principles of law in a rigorous and coherent way.\n\nI hope this helps!
