Posner's approach fails to offer a means by which to calculate individual prosperity.\n\nRonald Coase once described Richard Posner's economic analysis of law as \"a magnificent failure.\" This assessment reflects two facts: first that there are some important criticisms of his work and second that in spite of these he has made an enormous contribution to legal scholarship. One such critique comes from Ronald Dworkin who argues that Posner's theory suffers from several failures of logic. In particular, he believes that Posner misunderstands how judges decide cases; how precedents guide those decisions; what the goal or purpose of adjudication is; and how statutes should be construed. For instance, Dworkin points out that Posner often assumes that judges aim at wealth maximization yet nowhere provides evidence that they actually do so - indeed, he admits that no judge would acknowledge doing so if asked directly. He also charges that Posner relies on questionable empirical studies whose conclusions are based on dubious assumptions. Finally, he contends that Posner's case methodology is flawed since it requires him to make sweeping generalizations about legal principles and policies without any supportive data. According to Dworkin, all of these shortcomings lead him to conclude that \"the economic theory of law has not even reached the beginning of a beginning\" (2006, p. 58). Although Posner responded to many of these specific critiques in later editions of his treatise (and others have leveled counterarguments), his basic theoretical framework remains unchanged, and therefore, these issues persist. Thus, although Posner's economic analysis of law has been influential, its logical coherence still appears vulnerable.

Maine also compared these legal systems to English common law and observed similarities as well as differences among them. Although Austin had some ideas on comparing laws between England and other European countries (e.g., his discussions of civil law jurisdictions), his focus was more limited than Maine's or Kelsens'. Savigny did contribute to developing German Romanticism Jurisprudence, but his work mainly concentrated on criticism of French Civil Code and promotion of Germanic historical school; therefore, he played a minor role in development of Comparative Law. Kelsen later took up where Maine left off and developed Pure Theory of Law that emphasized comparability between different legal orders based on their internal logical consistency rather than their external similarities or inferiority/superiority rankings. Therefore, Maine and Kelsen are more closely associated with origins of modern comparative law than the others. So the answer should be either \"Maine\" or \"Kelsen,\" depending on whether one takes a stricter view of focusing only on those two figures who most directly contributed to its birth vs. those who significantly influenced its future direction. In practice, both answers would be acceptable here since neither is technically incorrect. However, I will choose option \"B\" because Maine deserves recognition for pioneering this field even though he may not have fully established it without help from Kelsen and others.
