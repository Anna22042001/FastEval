Statement 1 is false. If a and b are elements of finite order in an Abelian group, lcm(|a|, |b|) is a lower bound for |ab|, as we discussed earlier, but |ab| is generally smaller than the lcm. This is because the lcm is the maximum integer that is a common multiple of two or more numbers. Example: let a have order 4, b have order 3, and a = b^2. Then |ab| = 8, but 3 (the lcm of 4 and 3) is the least common multiple of 4 and 3 and 8 > 3. On the other hand, statement 2 is true: if a^n = e for some integer n, then |a| = n. This is because we defined |a| to be the smallest integer n such that a^n = e.\n\nHere's a way to approach statement 1 even a bit more conceptually: \n\nThe lcm and gcd of two numbers a and b are related by the equality: \na/gcd(a,b) = b/gcd(a,b) iff lcm(a,b) = gcd(a,b)b. \n\nThe case where a is inverted by b is related to the last formula by setting a/b=1, and thus gcd(a,b) = 1 and lcm(a,b) = ab = gcd(a,b)b =b. \n\nIf |a| = |b|, then a and b have the same order, and the gcd equals 1.
