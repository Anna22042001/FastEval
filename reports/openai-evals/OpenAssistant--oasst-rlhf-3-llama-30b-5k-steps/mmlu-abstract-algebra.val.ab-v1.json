To find the order of this group, we need to find the order of (Z_4 x Z_12)/(<2> x <2>).\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula for the order of a quotient group:\n\n|G/N| = |G|/|N|\n\nwhere |G| is the order of the group G and |N| is the order of the normal subgroup N.\n\nIn this case, |Z_4| = 4 and |Z_12| = 12, so |Z_4 x Z_12| = 4 x 12 = 48.
