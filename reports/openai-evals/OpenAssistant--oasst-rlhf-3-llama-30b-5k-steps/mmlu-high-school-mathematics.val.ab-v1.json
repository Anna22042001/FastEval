Therefore, T=11-L.\nLet S be the sum of all possible values of T. Then S is the sum of all possible values of 11-L, where L ranges from 0 to 11. Since L can take on any value from 0 to 11, we can use the formula for sum of an arithmetic sequence to find S: S = (11-L*L-L)/2.\nSince the problem states that each person is named in this way by exactly two other people, it means that each person is either named by both T and L, or by both T and truth-teller or by both a liar and a truth-teller.\nTherefore in each group at least 2T+L will be truth-tellers.\nThe sum of all possible values of T will be then 2T+L-minimum possible L(which occur when all are truth-tellers, L=0), that is 2T+L-0, which give a sum 2T+L, which is the sum of T.\nAnother view is that 2T will be truth-tellers in a group and each truth-teller will be named by 2 people, so there are 2T*(2T-1 )/2 * T = (11-L-1)T which also gives a sum of T.\nTherefore S=T for all possible value of T and the answer is T=30.\nNote that it can be shown that L can take on any value from 0 to 11, so T=11-L", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIn a group of 11 people, T of them always tell the truth, and L always lie.
