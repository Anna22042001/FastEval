(Note that 'dringao' would be an alternative spelling.) \n\nHere is how to obtain this answer: We take the first letter of each word, i.e., \"Dr\", \"i\", \"n\", \"g\", \"o\" and \"ne\". By pronouncing these letters we get \"dr-ingeonu\". The double consonant cluster \"-rgn-\" can only appear at the beginning or end of a syllable. In this case it appears at the end of the first syllable \"-rge-\", which contains the nucleus \"-e-\". So, there is no vowel after \"-rgn-\", and the whole sequence becomes the diphthong \"/dr…™≈ã/\". This leaves us with \"dringano\". As we have three adjacent consonants (\"ng\"), one of them must become silent according to the usual rules for English syllables; here we choose to make the middle element nasalize the preceding vowel and then disappear itself, giving us /dr…™nd íaun/.

If you prefer to consider the whole words then perhaps an alternative result might be \"border\", although strictly speaking \"doors\" should come before \"roses\" in alphabetical order.
