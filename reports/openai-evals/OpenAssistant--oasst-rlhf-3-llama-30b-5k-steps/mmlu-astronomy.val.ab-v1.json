The exact speed depends on various factors such as the altitude and inclination of the orbit, but 28000 km/h is a widely used estimate for an ISS-like orbit.\n\nThe ISS orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 410 km, and its orbital speed is determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling it towards the Earth and the centrifugal force due to its circular orbit. The gravitational force is proportional to the distance between the ISS and the center of the Earth, while the centrifugal force is proportional to the ISS's velocity squared.\n\nAt an altitude of 410 km, the gravitational force is approximately 90% of what it would be at sea level, while the centrifugal force increases linearly with the velocity. The ISS travels in an elliptical orbit with an inclination of around 51.6 degrees, which translates to a longer radius vector between the ISS and the center of the Earth.
