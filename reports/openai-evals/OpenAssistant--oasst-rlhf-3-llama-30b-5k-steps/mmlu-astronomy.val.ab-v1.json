Since these two halves are mirrors of eachother they cancels out temperature wise so there is no overall change in the average global temp over time despite significant diurnal changes in some places. In contrast both the moon and mars experience noticeable changes in surface temp based on their axial tilt, which means those planets get more or less direct exposure to sunlight as the earth orbits around them depending where you are.
