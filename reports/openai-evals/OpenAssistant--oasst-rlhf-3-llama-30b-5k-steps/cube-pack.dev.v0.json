If we take this as meaning that each cube exactly fills one unit cell of length 0.8x1.6=1.28 meters on average (since it has length, width and height equal to 0.7/2,1,0.8 meters), then the volume fraction occupied by each such unit cell will be (0.593)^3 = 0.43 or 43%: hence less than half of the available volume! Therefore, given what you wrote, there cannot exist any integer solution to this problem, i.e., the number of cubes that fit into the box must necessarily be zero or negative. However, if instead you allow for some gaps between the cubes (as implied by asking how many cubes fit rather than insisting they fill every available space), then indeed an integral solution exists because we can stack layers of cubes, each consisting of six cubes arranged in two rows of three cubes per row along the longer dimension; since the available distance along the long dimension is 1.6 meters and the length of each cube (on this axis) is 0.8-0.7=0.1 meter, we get that the total number of layers of cubes needed is at most (1.6)/(0.1+0.1+0.1)=9 layers. Each layer contains 6 cubes and so we find there are 9*6=54 cubes that fit in the box, ignoring edge effects.
