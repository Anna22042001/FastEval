The reasoning behind it: Since we're looking at a complete binary tree which is represented by means of an array where the root of the tree is placed at index 0 and each additional element represents either a left or right child of its respective parent node. Given that the function is defined such that it returns the index of the parent in the case of an internal node (i.e., a node whose both children are non-null), thus if 'w' is not null then the root will be located exactly at position 0, hence w = 0 wouldn't make sense, therefore our target should be any other index except for 0. As a result, since the elements in the array representing the tree form a continuous sequence ranging from 0 up to N-1 as they represent the tree nodes in ascending order according to their positions relative to one another, the first half of the elements starts from 0 until approximately N/2 while the second half begins thereafter and goes all the way down to N-1. Hence the formula used to calculate the value of the variable \"parent\" for a given node 'w' becomes simply dependent on whether 'w' belongs to either half of these two parts of the array; thus when w lies within the first half of indices then \"parent\" should take on the expression floor((w - 1)/2); otherwise (when w resides within the latter part of the sequence of indices) one should set \"parent\" equal to ceiling((w - 1)/2). Ultimately, this way whenever \"w\" points to some leaf in T we get rid of those floors and ceils as they cancel out, leaving us finally with only integer divisions by 2.
