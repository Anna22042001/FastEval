While sorting the last i elements in each step takes O(i^2) in the worst case, the stepsize is reduced by a factor of two at each step, implying there are no more than lg n stages needed for completion. Thus the auxiliary space requirement is given by the sum lg n * O(i^2) = O(n log n) + lg n * O(i^3) which is O(n log n + i^3* n). This simplifies to O(n log n).\n\n\nThe cycle sort algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Using a two pointer approach, find out the smallest i^2 such  that arr[0]^2 < arr[1]^2 < arr[2]^2 < arr[i^2-2]^2 > arr[i^2-1^2]. We know arr[i^2-2]^2 to be the square of the middle element for this section. Using this observation, we can bound our search in O(n^2/2).\n\n2. Around this two pointer region, the element at index i^2 is a square which is smaller than arr[i^2-2^2]. Moving outward, elements increase in magnitude until the next square is found past a distance of i-2 (The squares have a gap of 1 between them). Thus, the elements from arr[i^2-1] to arr[i^2] are squares. Thus for the first i elements, arrange the non-square elements in a decreasing order. While doing so, note the maximum such element for the two adjacent blocks i^2, 2*i^2.\n\n3.

Binary tree sort works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays represented as binary trees.\n2. The root of the tree is the middle element of the original array. Each subproblem is solved by performing a binary search to find the corresponding elements in the subarrays.\n3. Heap sort, on the other hand, also involves dividing the input array into subarrays represented as a heap data structure.\n4. The heap is then recursively shrunk by performing the max-heap property maintenance operation (i.e., swapping the root with a smaller element in the heap) until all elements are merged into the result array.\n5. Compared to binary tree sort, heap sort has a better worst-case performance since it always takes O(n log n) time, whereas binary tree sort takes O(n log^2 n) time.\n\nTherefore, heap sort can be considered as an improvement to binary tree sort in terms of performance.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that all the sorting algorithms you have listed (heap sort, quick sort, selection sort, insertion sort) are O(n log n) in average case and are considered highly effective in practice.

The reason being that since tree can be viewed as an array of arrays, in this case, as normal array, to implement a complete binary tree, we need to know the maximum number of nodes that would be possible in that tree. We needs to know this to ensure that the array has enough space to accommodate all the nodes which may or may not be equal to 2 to the power of number of bits used to represent the nodes. Thus it is not feasible, if we are unaware of the numbers of nodes in the tree. Instead we are recommended to use dynamic data structures such as linked lists for storing the elements of the tree. \n\nAlso a) it is not difficult in knowing children nodes of a node as they can be easily accessed by simply accessing the elements of the array using arithmetic operations on the node's array index. b) also there is no difficulty in finding the parent of a node as it can be easily determined as the one which is located at index floor((i-1)/2) of the array, where 'i' is the index of the child node, incase of a binary tree and c) difficulty in implementing is also debatable as implementing tree using normal arrays is relatively straightforward.
