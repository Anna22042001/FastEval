This means that if the array was originally sorted when the algorithm runs, the elements will remain in their original position. Hence, Insertion sort, Bubble sort, Selection sort are stable sorting methods. Among the options given, Bubble sort and Selection sort are stable sorting methods and they also have a time complexity of O(n^2). Cycle sort has a much higher time complexity of O(n). Mergesort has a time complexity of O(nLogn) in average and in worst case. Thus, Insertion sort is the best sort method among the options with a time complexity of O(n^2) and being stable. Hence, the answer is option D: Merge sort is the best sort method among the options listed with a worst case time complexity of O(nLogn). Since Mergesort is known for its efficiency and stability, it is a good choice for sorting large arrays. Although other sorting algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort, and selection sort might have a lower time complexity under certain scenarios, Mergesort remains a sound choice for most scenarios. Thus, Mergesort is a powerful sorting mechanism that effectively handles large arrays with efficiency and stability.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.
