The 50-W bulb is twice as bright.\n\nWhen bulbs are connected in series, their voltage across each bulb is reduced and current increases. The brightness of a bulb is proportional to the power it consumes. Consider the formula for power P = V * I, when voltage is reduced current increases to maintain the total power which means the bulbs will be consuming more current and have more power consumption in series. Therefore, the brighter bulb with higher power consumption will be dimmer than other which has less current and less power consumption. The correct answer D. The 50-W bulb is twice as bright.\n\nThe correct concept to solve this problem is in series connection, bulbs tend to consume more current and power and voltage is reduced. In the case of parallel connection, bulbs tend to dissipate more power (if directly connected to same voltage) in order to reduce current.
