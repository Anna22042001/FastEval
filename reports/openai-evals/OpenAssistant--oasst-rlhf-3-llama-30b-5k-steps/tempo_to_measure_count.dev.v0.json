Do not add any additional text such as comments since I do not have this capability.\n\nRemember, a time signature is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are contained in each measure (bar), and which note value is equivalent to an entire beat. In Western music, the most common time signatures are 2/2 (almost universal), 3/4 (such as waltz or schottische), and 4/4 (such as most rock and pop music), in addition to 2/4, 3/8, and 5/8. In compound meters, the beats are divided into three parts rather than two, with the beat divided into three equal parts.\n\nThe tempo is the speed of the music, measured in minutes per hour. It is usually given in note-values/minute, such as notes per minute (NPM). A common notation is that a quarter note (crotchet in British nomenclature) equates to 60 counts per minute (BPM) (18 notes per measure at 6/8).\n\nIn music theory, a measure is a segment of time corresponding to a specific number of beats that sets the tempo. A Performance is the interpretation and execution of the notated music. The performer generally decides, in the course of practicing and rehearsing the work, how to execute certain aspects of the performance (dynamics, phrasing, slew, articulation, partials, vibrato, timbre, harmonics/overtones, attack, decay).

It means there are 4 quarter notes in each measure.\n\nThe total number of notes in the given list is 4 x 6 + 2 x 2 = 24. Since each measure contains 4 quarter notes and there are 24 quarter notes in total, the duration of this note series is 24/4=6 measures. However, the actual duration will be longer than 6 measures, as the tempo factor needs to be considered.\n\nAs a further explanation, let's break down the note values in each pair of measures:\n\nMeasures:\n1-2: Whole + Whole, duration: 2\n3-4: Half + Eighth, duration: 1.5\n5-6: Quarter + Eighth, duration: 1.25\n7-8: Whole + Eighth, duration: 2\n9-10: Half + Eighth, duration: 1.5\n11-12: Quarter + Eighth, duration: 1.25\n13-14: Half + Eighth, duration: 1.5\n15-16: Whole + Eighth, duration: 2\n17-18: Half + Half and Eighth + Eighth, duration: 2.5\n19-20: Quarter + Quarter, duration: 1\n21-22: Eighth + Eighth, duration: 0.75\n23-24: Quarter + Quarter, duration: 1\n\nSince the tempo value is given in terms of measures, I cannot directly calculate the total duration based on the tempo value.
