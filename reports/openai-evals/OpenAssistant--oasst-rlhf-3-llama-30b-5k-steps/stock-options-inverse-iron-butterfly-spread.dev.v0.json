The break-even prices for these options depend on when they will be exercised (if ever), which depends on the underlying stock's market price over time until expiry, among other factors such as trading fees and taxes. It appears you have sold puts with strikes of $70 and $77, bought puts with strikes of $73 and $70, and sold calls with strikes of $77 and $73. Assuming no dividends paid by the company during this period, the formulas for computing potential gains/losses and therefore the break-even share prices are as follows: For short put options: Gain = Max[0, Strike - Market Price]; Loss = Max[0, Market Price - Strike], where 'Strike' represents the specified strike price and 'Market Price' is the stock price at exercise; note that both of these equations assume that the option is NOT exercised early based on its intrinsic value relative to its time value component. For long put options: Gain = Max[0, Market Price - Strike]; Loss = Max[Time Value Component, Time Value Component + Market Price - Strike], assuming that any remaining extrinsic/time value has evaporated by expiry. Similarly for call options, using their respective strike and current market prices. To determine the overall break-even stock price, we need to consider each position separately first since some positions may result in net losses while others net gains even if exercised simultaneously, so simply taking average or weighted average prices won't work here directly.

This represents the most money you could lose if the stock ends up below its lower target price or above its upper target price on the expiration date. The maximum possible gain is calculated by subtracting the sum of all the premiums received from the sale of options ($-$0.1 - $+$3.55 - $+$0.1) from the difference between the upper target price and the lower target price minus any costs associated with the trade.
