These reflexes can provide important clues for healthcare professionals to evaluate an infant's central nervous system, muscular system, and sensory functions. During the first year of life, infants typically outgrow many of these reflexes as their nervous system and muscle control develop.\n\nHere are some common newborn reflexes and their typical age of disappearance:\n\n1. Rooting Reflex (Age of disappearance: 6-8 months)\nThe rooting reflex is a common newborn reflex that helps infants find and latch onto the mother's nipple during breastfeeding. When the corner of the baby's mouth or lips are stimulated, they will turn their head and open their mouth, in an attempt to find the source of stimulation (usually the nipple).\n2. Grasp Reflex (Age of disappearance: 6-8 months)\nThe grasp reflex is another important newborn reflex that helps a baby hold onto a finger or other objects. When an infant's palm is touched, they will close their fingers into a grasping position.\n3.
