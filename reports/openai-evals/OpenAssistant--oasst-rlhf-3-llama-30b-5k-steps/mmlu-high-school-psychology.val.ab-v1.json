It also differs from similar responses seen in adults and older children (e.g., when licking an ice cream cone), in that the latter do not involve a full opening of the mouth with accompanying tongue extension, but rather movement of the tongue to the roof of the mouth alone while keeping the lips closed tightly around whatever they have taken into their mouths. When elicited in an infant, the head turns toward the stimulus automatically — without conscious thought. Root reflex: As part of this reflex, an object touching the cheek causes the baby’s head to turn towards the stroke, his mouth opens, his tongue starts moving, and he takes in whatever touched his cheek into his mouth. Hand–to–mouth reflex: This occurs simultaneously as part of the root reflex. If you stroke your finger down an infant’s arm, she will close her hand into a fist around your fingers.

The theory states that when you experience an intense negative emotion such as fear or anxiety, your body goes through a series of changes in preparation for action. These physical responses may include increased heart rate, perspiration, and muscle tension. Once the perceived threat has passed, there is another stage of response called reactive depression. During this stage, which can last several hours or even days after the initial event, physiological arousal decreases; and you might feel irritable, jumpy, anxious, restless, and tired. This reaction conserves energy while giving you time to recover from the acute stress response. If you continue to face stressors without proper recovery time, your body may eventually become exhausted—which could lead to psychological problems such as anxiety disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It’s important to note that not all stressful situations cause PTSD, nor does everyone who experiences a traumatic event develop the condition. However, experiencing extreme trauma or threats to safety often triggers symptoms related to PTSD if left untreated. Symptoms usually appear within the first three months following exposure but sometimes don't surface until years later. \n\nSource: https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-the-opponent-process-theory-2798604", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAccording to the opponent process theory of emotions,\nA) opposing emotions after a primary emotion are always weaker than the primary one\nB) red emotions are followed by green emotions\nC) repetitions of an emotion-arousing event strengthen the opposing emotion\nD) happiness and unhappiness combine to keep someone relatively stable over a lifetime", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:48:16.612942+00:00"}
