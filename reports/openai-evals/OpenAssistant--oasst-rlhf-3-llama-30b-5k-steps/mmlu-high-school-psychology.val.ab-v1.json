This explanation is aligned with the information provided in the passage and provides a coherent explanation for Karmina's response.\n\nAlthough latent learning, response generalization, and prepared learning are all concepts in classical conditioning, they do not accurately predict Karmina's response in the given scenario.

By using a variable ratio schedule, the rate of responding remains high because the subject does not know exactly how much time or how many behaviors must pass before the next reinforcement is given. This makes the behavior less resistant to extinction compared to a fixed ratio schedule, where the subject knows exactly how much time or how many behaviors must pass before the next reinforcement is given. The variable ratio schedule is usually more resistant to extinction than a fixed interval or fixed ratio schedule because the subject does not know exactly when the next reinforcement will be given, which keeps them continuing to perform the behavior.\n\nA) Variable ratio schedules don't necessarily avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle, which state that a response that is reinforced in one situation can be used to reinforce a response in another situation.\nB) Fixed ratio schedules are not necessarily more time intensive.\nC) Variable ratio schedules may produce results more quickly, but this is not the only reason for using them.\n\nHere are some additional resources that may be helpful:\n\n* \"Skinner Box Operant Conditioning Chamber in Psychology,\" Verywell Mind (<https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-skinner-box-2797469>)\n* \"Variable Ratio schedule,\" Psychology Glossary (<https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Variable+Ratio+Schedule>)\n* \"Skinner's Theory of", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhy might a researcher use a variable ratio of reinforcement rather than a fixed ratio?\nA) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\nB) Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcements are more time intensive.\nC) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements produce results more quickly.\nD) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-18 20:58:43.004908+00:00"}
