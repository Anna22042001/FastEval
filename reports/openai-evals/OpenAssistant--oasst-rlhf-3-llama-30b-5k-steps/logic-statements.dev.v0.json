This means all elements in A fall under category C (as they must satisfy both conditions).\n2. Some metals are black: B' ∩ C = D', where B' stands for \"some metals\" and D' stand for the intersection of B' and C i.e. \"black metals\". By definition of subset this implies there exists at least one element x such that x belongs to B' but not belong to C, thus it falls under category D'. If we consider another element y which does belong to B' and C (i.e. satisfies both condition), by definition of subset it must also fall under D'. As D' can be non-empty we have proven our point.\n3. Therefore some gold is black: C ∩ D' = E, where E represents \"gold that is black.\" It should be clear now why this must hold given what we derived earlier.\nSo in formal logic form we can write:\nA ∩ B = C, B' ∩ C = D', C ∩ D' = E --> C ∩ (B' ∩ C) = E (using distributive property on left side).

We know that P ⊆ C, and that there exists a subset S ⊂ C such that for all s in S, s is also in P. The conclusion \"some planets are stars\" can then be expressed symbolically as: ∃p∈P (p ∈ S). However, this does not imply that ∀c∈C c ∈ S, which would be necessary to conclude that \"all planets are stars.\" In fact, it could equally well be the case that C \\ P has non-empty intersection with both P and S, meaning that there exist objects that are neither stars nor planets. This is in contrast to the premises, where we only have statements about subsets of sets, but no information on the existence or properties of other sets. While it may seem counterintuitive at first glance that planets and stars could share the same set of characteristics yet still differ ontologically, this can often happen in mathematics due to how we define our terms and construct our models; see for instance the conceptual difficulties surrounding cardinality and infinity. Therefore, while the argument appears valid based on its structure and mathematical formulation alone, more domain knowledge must be added before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.\nHowever, note that the argument above focuses specifically on mathematical definitions, whereas in practical usage planets and stars are very different kinds of objects. For example, one can point out their differences in mass, composition, formation history, etc., and argue that these make them distinct classes even if they do share certain commonalities.

Because having four tires could equally well be seen as an additional positive trait for vehicles with four wheels - just like being destructive might be another trait beyond simply being stormy. It turns out that there exist vehicles which technically meet one definition of a 'car' but don't have rubber tires (e.g. trains), so you can't automatically extend the premise to say anything meaningful about tires without including more context. To generalize further into areas where assumptions might otherwise be made, we would need something like this instead:\n\"Cars typically have four rubber-tired wheels\".\nBut even adding words like \"typically\", \"usually,\" etc. isn't foolproof because those terms aren't exactly precise either, especially when people start getting creative about modifying their vehicles.
