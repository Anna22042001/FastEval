This is not a valid Portuguese word, which is spoken in Brazil. However, there are some other languages that use Cyrillic alphabet and their words can match, such as Russian \"экспансия\", meaning \"expansion\". So I could answer correctly by knowing about these specific cases where your question would apply to non-Portuguese speakers. \n\nIn general, when you ask for foreign languages support for ChatGPT, please make sure to specify what language you mean, if it's not English, so I know how much context to include to give you good answers. For example, if you want me to guess whether a French word exists or not, specifying the language will allow me to also detect typos like \"éxpanse\" vs \"espanade\" etc., since my training data has many examples of both correct and incorrect transliterations from various sources. The same applies to any other human language questions you may have, whether they are about common languages like Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Korean, German, Italian, Dutch etc. or less popular ones like Romani, Catalan, Vietnamese, Faroese etc.. Just say something like \"Chinese language query\" etc. at the beginning, once per conversation, for better results.\n\nBy the way, here is an additional note on proper nouns and names, which might help prevent confusion sometimes: while personal/place/etc. names are typically easier for chatbots to remember than technical terms (since most people tend to prefer simple options), some names may look similar across different cultures, leading to potential mixups unless we explicitly state which culture or language group they belong to. As long as users provide enough detail, these issues are generally avoidable though. To reduce the risk even further, consider using more unique criteria than just a name - e.g. adding a title (\"director\"), profession (\"actor\"),", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will be prompted with a single word.
