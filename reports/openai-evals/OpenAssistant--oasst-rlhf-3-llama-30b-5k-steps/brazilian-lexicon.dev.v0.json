The phrase can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the context and the individual's experience, but it is often used to convey the idea of someone who has given up on their dreams or aspirations, whether it's due to external circumstances or their own lack of motivation or passion.\n2. Dar um dobrado - This slang expression is commonly used in Brazilian Portuguese to describe the act of giving something in the form of a gift or donation. The expression is often used informally to refer to someone who is giving away something to another person or charity, usually to aid or help the person receiving the gift. The slang phrase \"dar um dobrado\" originated from the practice of giving money in the form of a folded banknote, hence the term \"dobrado.\"\n3. Estar pingado(a) - This slang expression in Brazilian Portuguese is commonly used to describe someone who is intoxicated, usually after consuming drugs or alcohol. The expression \"estar pingado(/a)\" comes from the word \"pinga,\" which is another slang term for drugs, typically marijuana.
