We can do this by using the IRR formula:\n\nICO = Discounted cash flow / [1 + IRR)^n]\n\nwhere n is the number of periods (in years), and ICO is the present value of all future cash flows discounted back to their present values using the IRR as the discount rate.\n\nPlugging in the numbers from the question, we have:\n\n* Net cash benefits: 10 * $2,500 = $25,000\n* Terminal benefit: $5,000\n* Number of years: 10\n* Required rate of return: 8%\n\nTherefore:\n\nICO = ($25,000 + $5,000) / [(1+IRR)^(10)]\n\nSince the IRR is not given, we cannot solve for the ICO directly. However, since we know that the cash inflows satisfy the company's required rate of return of 8%, we can set the NPV equal to zero and solve for the IRR numerically:\n\nNPV = (-$X - $CF_1 - $CF_2 - ... - $CF_n) / (1 + IRR)^n = 0", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nBackInSoon, Inc., has estimated that a proposed project's 10-year annual net cash benefit, received each year end, will be $2,500 with an additional terminal benefit of $5,000 at the end of the tenth year.
