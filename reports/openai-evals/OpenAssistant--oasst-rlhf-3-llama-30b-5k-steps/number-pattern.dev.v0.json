The pattern here is that you simply subtract 2 from each number to find the next number in the sequence. Starting with 9, we can see that 9 - 2 = 7, and 7 - 2 = 5, and so on. Subtracting 2 from 37 gives us 35, which is closer to our answer than any of the other options. \nTherefore, your answer is B. \nYour sequence of numbers is described by the formula:\na(n) = a(n-1) - 2 for n >= 1\nwhere a(n) is the nth term in the sequence, and a(0) is the first term in the sequence. \nYou can prove that 35 is the most suitable answer by using induction. \nFor example, if n = 4 (corresponding to the term a(4) = 39), then a(4) = a(3) - 2 according to the formula. And then, a(3) = a(2) - 2, and a(2) = a(1) - 2. So we can conclude that a(n) = a(n-2). Consequently, the pattern of numbers above is always decrease by 2 which means that the given answer doesn't fit into this relationship. Therefore, the above pattern of numbers and your answer \"35\" don't have a specific formula. But you can still find the next or previous (if exists) number in this sequence by subtracting or adding a fixed value (2 in this case) from this number respectively. So in conclusion, you still need to deduce the pattern and apply an operation in order to find the solution.

Thus, the next number in the sequence is 23, the square of the index of the fourth prime in Fibonacci's sequence, whose index is 5. Here, we can see that both 3 and 5 are primary numbers in Fibonacci's sequence, which contributes to this pattern. The subsequent number is square of the index of the eight prime in Fibonacci's sequence, $8=2^3$. This pattern of squares of the indices of primes in Fibonacci's sequence continues, and the difference between consecutive terms is $2$. As this pattern will continue, the next number should be the square of an index whose prime number's index is $21$. Therefore, the next number in this sequence is $21^2=441$. Consequently, the pattern for $p=4^2$ should be $4, B, 441, 1764, 6825, 2748, 11632, \\dots$, where $B$ represents the numbers of secondary primes in the Fibonacci sequence for which their squares are part of this sequence. That is, $B$ represents the primary and secondary primes in the Fibonacci sequence whose squares form this pattern, which does not depend on $p$.\n\nHence, we only need to solve $23=3^2$, $8= 2^3$, and $21$ and $34$ both are primes in the Fibonacci sequence for $p=4$.
