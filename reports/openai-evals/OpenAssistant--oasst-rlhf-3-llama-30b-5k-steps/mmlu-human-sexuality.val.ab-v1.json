Inis Beag, a small Irish island, as well as most of Europe, practiced 'troscud.' Troscud is the exchange of female kin for sex, especially the practice of using girl babies as currency. Often times, it was limited to daughters, as it was the \"least costly\" form of exchange. Men in Inis Beag traded their wife's sexual services for \"cows from the farm,\" or their unmarried daughters for an arranged marriage. In most societies, Troscud was not sexual congress with daughters, but rather an arranged marriage between unrelated (or less related) men and girls in exchange for property or services, as in the case of an exchange of \"three cows\" for the bride. This custom and the societal restrictions are described in depth in this article \"Taboos on the Use of Money, Authority, and Magic: The Case of an Irish Island\" found in the Journal 'American Anthropologist Vol. 65, No. 5 (1963).
