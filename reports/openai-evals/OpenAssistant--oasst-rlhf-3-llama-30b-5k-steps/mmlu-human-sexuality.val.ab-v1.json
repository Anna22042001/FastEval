All of them could be considered as important stages but none would necessarily mean the end of the process or imply its completion. The LGBTQ+ rights movement continue to fight for equal representation, legal protection against discrimination and violence. Coming out continues even after marriage equality because people still face exclusion from jobs, housing services among other issues based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Many times members of the same family don't know about each other's sexuality or identity which makes it hard for some people to come out publicly. This also highlights the importance of providing safe spaces where everyone feels comfortable being themselves.

Partner notification also important for preventing spread of disease. Condoms alone cannot fully protect against transmission of infection because it may occur in areas not covered by condom. However, consistent use of latex condoms during vaginal or anal intercourse can reduce risk of catching chlamydia & gonorrhea if user takes certain precautions such as ensuring proper placement before sexual contact occurs and avoids using oil-based lubricants which can cause breakage. If infected individual has no symptoms they are still able to unknowingly transmit STI to their partner(s). When both partners have tested negative then they must discuss what actions give them the confidence that neither of them has been exposed since last time they were tested. For example, one possible approach would require mutual monogamy for at least 14 days after testing negative for both partners, but this duration depends on many factors so you should consult your doctor.
