The type of ticket purchased (economy vs. premium economy/business class) - Refundable tickets tend to be more expensive and often reserved for premium classes. If you bought an affordable economy class ticket, it may be less likely to be refundable.\n2. Airline policies regarding ticket changes/refunds - Some airlines offer flexible fares that allow for free changes/cancellations while others charge hefty fees or penalties for any adjustments. Researching the airline's policy beforehand would provide insight into its refundability practices.\n3. Time frame between booking and travel date - Generally, the closer your travel date approaches, the lower the chances are of receiving a full refund since airlines usually restrict or completely disallow last-minute changes. Booking well in advance might increase the odds of getting your money back if needed.\n4.

Wearing a pair of rubber gloves greatly reduces the probability of your hands coming into direct contact with anything you are handling, thus decreasing the chances that bacteria present on said surfaces would come in contact with your bare skin. Given this premise, wearing rubber gloves should also lessen the chance that your skin comes into contact with any other objects which might be contaminated during the cleanup process - provided the gloves themselves do not become contaminated prior to removal after completion of the task at hand. Thus it is reasonable to conclude that \"getting towels and wipes\" does not significantly alter the overall outcome, assuming they too remain uncontaminated by harmful microorganisms before disposal following their use; however if the cleaning rags were to somehow get contaminated during usage then the answer could potentially shift towards being more likely rather than staying the same (depending on how exactly they became infected). It may also be worth considering whether or not these cloths/rags could cause an injury through over-exertion when attempting to clean up spills with them, which depending on severity of such an event could lead to increased chances of actual contact between skin and dirty surface. For example: if someone was using a wet cloth to scrub down counters covered in sticky food items (like maple syrup), there exists a non-negligible chance that said person might accidentally slip while vigorously rubbing due to moisture buildup causing their feet/hands to lose traction leading to falls or collisions with nearby hard surfaces resulting in cuts/injuries. Though for all intents and purposes such an occurrence can realistically be deemed unlikely enough as to not heavily factor into this assessment one way or another unless specific circumstances warrant further consideration along those lines.
