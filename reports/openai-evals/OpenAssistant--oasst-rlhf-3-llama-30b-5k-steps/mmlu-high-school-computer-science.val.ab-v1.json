Binary search is the most efficient method for searching for a specific record in a sorted list of records. It involves repeatedly dividing the list in half until the desired record is found. This method has the best time complexity of O(log n).\n\nInsertion sort and mergesort are both sorting algorithms that require shifting elements around in the list, which is not necessary for just searching for a specific record. Sequential search involves searching through the entire list one record at a time. While it may not be the most efficient way, it will find the entry.

The hospital administrators decide that in order to reduce wait times, patients should not be evaluated by the doctor closest to the patient's location, but instead should randomly choose one of the available n doctors and see that doctor instead.
