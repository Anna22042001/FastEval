However this has not been proven, so A) is the correct answer. Alan Turing proved that the Entscheidungsproblem is unsolvable, while Church proved the λ-calculus to be computable.\n\nComputability theory is an area of study that investigates which formal systems (or languages) admit computable functions (or programs). This area of study has profound connections to mathematical logic; therefore it is of great mathematical and philosophical interest: are there mathematical functions that cannot be computed. Alan Turing showed that not all total computable functions are recursive.\n\nAlonzo Church showed using the λ-calculus or general recursive functions that  all computable functions could be computed by a general recursive  function. However he also showed that there is no general recursive function that admits a computable supremum. Although  Church did show that recursive functions can simulate  lambda-definable functions, but this raises the possibility that some functions recursive in the λ-calculus are not recursive. In light of these results, Alonzo Church developed the second system of type theory, whose lambda-abstraction consists of generalrecursive functions, and its set of types general recursive sets.\n\nIf you require a refresher on Turing machines, please see my summary here: [Alan Turing’s contributions to Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.josephtan.me/2019/06/alan-turings", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nChurch's thesis equates the concept of \"computable function\" with those functions computable by, for example, Turing machines.
