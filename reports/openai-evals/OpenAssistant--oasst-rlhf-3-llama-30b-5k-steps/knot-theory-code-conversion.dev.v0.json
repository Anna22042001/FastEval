This can be converted into the more familiar representation of tiling diagrams by first translating it back to its original form as an instruction list and then following that list.\n\nThe first two elements have no effect on any subsequent ones so we start with \"1[O]\", which means that all the tiles are white on one side (the 'O' here refers to the orientation). Then we follow the instructions from left to right, painting each tile according to its orientation. If you do not have access to such tiles you could imagine them as square pieces of cardboard with black and white sides. In this case the directions will refer to the front or rear faces rather than top/bottom or left/right.\n\nTo perform an instruction like \"[R][+2]\" you would rotate the piece 90 degrees clockwise around the axis passing through the marked vertex ('+') on the bottom face and move it forward two positions, keeping track of how many times it has been rotated. To make things easier I recommend visualizing yourself holding a small cube made up of these tiles and manipulating it accordingly. You don't need to worry about marking vertices as they will always coincide with edges anyway since our pieces are cubes.\n\nFor example if you had just placed a tile down so that its front face was facing towards you, and were standing at position 1 looking towards position 2, [R] would mean turn the whole structure counterclockwise until the tile in front of your eyes flips over and lands upside down.

Each element of the sequence has been replaced with its corresponding value from the table, as shown above. For example, the first two elements have become 1 and -2 respectively, and so on. This Dowker-Thistlethwaite code can be used to construct a version of the original tangle using an algorithm that involves travelling along edges according to the numbers associated with them. By applying it systematically to every vertex of the tangle, we get back our original structure. In general, any sequence of integers can be converted into a Dowker-Thistlethwaite code by assigning values to it based on some pattern or rule. Once these are known, they can be used in combination with other data (such as coordinates) to reconstruct structures like tangles, graphs, shapes and surfaces. This technique allows us to represent complex geometric objects in terms of simpler numerical codes, which can make calculations and simulations much more efficient. It also enables us to encode information into patterns, designs and images. This approach is widely used in computer graphics, image processing, encryption and security applications.
