The premium received from selling the lower strike call helps offset the cost of buying the higher strike call, thereby reducing the overall cost of the position.\n\nThe goal of this strategy is to benefit from a rise in the stock price without having to pay the full premium of a plain call option. If the stock price rises above the strike price of the call option sold, both options will increase in value, allowing the investor to profit from the difference between the two options. However, if the stock price rises above the strike price of the call option purchased, the investor will still have to pay the difference to exercise the option, potentially leading to a loss.\n\nA bull call spread can be considered a conservative strategy, as it has a limited profit potential but also a limited risk. The potential gain is determined by the difference between the strike prices less the net credit received, while the potential loss is limited to the net credit received.\n\nNote: This is just a classification and a brief explanation of the option strategy described above. It is not a comprehensive explanation or a recommendation to implement the strategy.
