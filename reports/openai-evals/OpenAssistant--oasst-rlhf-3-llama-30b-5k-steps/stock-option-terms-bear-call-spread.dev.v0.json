An increase in stock price would result in both options becoming less valuable as they lose time value due to being further out-of-the-money (OTM), while a decrease in stock price would allow the sold call option to be exercised and profit taken from selling the underlying stock at $390, offsetting any potential losses on the bought call option which may now become ITM.
