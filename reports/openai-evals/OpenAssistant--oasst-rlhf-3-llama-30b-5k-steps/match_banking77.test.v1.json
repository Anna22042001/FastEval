There are several things you can do when you notice that the recipient hasn't received the money you sent:\nTo troubleshoot issues related to sending money, it's essential to determine the cause of the problem. Common reasons for failed transactions include incorrect recipient information, incorrect transaction details, and unexpected delays. To help you resolve the issue quickly and efficiently, we recommend the following steps:\nTo help you find the most suitable course of action, it's important to classify your challenge. Here are 6 potential classes to help narrow down possible solutions:\n\n1. Transmission timeout\n2. Invalid account number or IBAN (International Bank Account Number)\n3. Transaction declined by the recipient's bank\n4. Transaction cancelled by the sender or recipient\n5. Incorrect sender or recipient details\n6. Recipient's account not found\n7. Other issues not mentioned above, like unrecognized transaction type.\nWe can help you better if you provide us with more information such as the recipient's bank name, the transaction reference number and swift code of the recipient's bank.\nWe recommend that you check the receipt and compare it to the sender's account. Ensure that the account details and the IBAN are correct. If the details are accurate, verify that the sender used the correct recipient name, account number, and corresponding routing code, especially when making international transactions. Check the recipient's bank account status to determine if there are any issues with the account, such as bank account issues that might cause delays in transferring money.\nOur data indicates that several factors can cause failed transactions, including incorrect receiver information, invalid account details, transfer cancellations, inactive accounts or poor network connection.

Additionally, it is possible that there are specific restrictions or limitations placed on your disposable card by the issuer. In general, disposable cards are intended for single-use only and are not intended for long-term use. It would be best for you to check with the issuer of the card for more information on the specific restrictions and limitations placed on your card.
