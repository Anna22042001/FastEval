A telomere is a repeating sequence of non-coding DNA that is added to the ends of a chromosome, acting as a \"cap\" to protect the ends of the chromosome from degradation and fusion. When a normal cell divides, the telomeres get shorter with each division due to the inability of the DNA polymerase enzyme to fully copy the DNA at the ends of the chromosomes. Eventually, when telomeres get too short, the cell can undergo a process called \"cell senescence\" where the cell stops dividing and becomes inactive or dies. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are able to bypass this process by expressing telomerase, which adds back the lost telomere sequences and allows the cell to continue dividing. Therefore, cancer cells have no upper limit on cell division, while normal cells are protected from cancer when they have telomerase. Answer option C is not correct because normal cells become cancerous when their telomere strands are used up, whereas cancer cells are able to bypass telomere shortening.

Social support refers to the assistance, information, and emotional support that individuals perceive is available to them in social relationships (Cutilli, 1997). The relationships from which individuals receive social support can include friends, neighbors, family, and spouse (Conger, 1993). Social support can be categorized as either instrumental or emotional. Instrumental support refers to tangible aid, such as assistance with household chores or errands, while emotional support refers to sympathetic understanding, empathy, and reassurance (Conger, 1993). The presence of both spousal and non-spousal social support has been shown to have a positive effect on overall well-being in retirement (Conger, 1993). Additionally, research has shown that social support resources predict subsequent health status and health decline (Cohen & Wills, 1985).\nSocial support is particularly important for retirees because many of the resources that provided structure and meaning in a person’s working life are no longer available (Vaitkus and Cann, 1999).
