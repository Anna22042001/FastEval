This phase can last months or years, and is sometimes referred to as complicated grief or traumatic grief.\n\nIt's worth noting that grief is not a linear process and can involve oscillations between different stages, or experiences of the stages at different intensities over time. So while there is often a tendency for the disorganization and despair stage to be more prolonged than other stages, that can vary a lot depending on the individual and circumstances.\n\nHere are some additional thoughts to take into account while writing the exam:\n\n1. **Grief reactions can vary widely by individual and circumstances**. Each person experiences loss and grieves differently based on their personal history, coping style, social support, cultural background, and the nature of their loss.\n2. The **DSM-5**'s *persistent complex bereavement disorder* diagnosis (309.46) applies to those who experience impairment in functioning due to grief and mourning that lasts for at least 12 months after the death of a loved one. You could perhaps mention this diagnosis in passing or in a relevant context when answering exam questions.\n3. Other factors that can affect how people experience grief include the **type of loss** (e.g., sudden vs. anticipated, violation of natural or expected order of life), **meaning of the deceased person to the mourner** (e.g., attachment style, role in life), and **available social support**, including **cultural and religious beliefs** (e.g., how they shape grieving process and coping strategies).
