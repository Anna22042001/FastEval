Cell cultures can continue to grow indefinitely if given proper conditions, such as adequate nutrients and protection from harmful factors. However, this is not true for all types of cells or under all circumstances. Some cell lines may eventually reach a stage called crisis, where they cease growth due to genetic instability. Additionally, some cells in vivo do exhibit limited lifespan even without telomeric attrition, such as stem cells that go through a predetermined number of divisions before exhausting their replicative potential. Nonetheless, the statement refers generally but not universally to mammalian cell cultures which exhibits unlimited proliferation in vitro.

Telomeres play an important role in cell division by acting as protective caps at chromosome ends. They prevent DNA damage during replication and ensure accurate segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. Every time a cell divides, its telomeres become shorter, until eventually they get too short and trigger cellular senescence, leading to irreversible arrestment of cell growth. The length of telomeres is tightly linked to cellular ageing process. So, option B, \"Stop dividing when their telomere strands are gone\" is incorrect because cells don't die directly caused by depletion of telomeres. Instead, it leads to the onset of replicative senescence where cells enter a state of permanent growth arrest.\n2.

Close relationships are particularly important to older people, and as a result, their circle of intimates may be smaller but closer in nature than those of younger individuals (Sarkisian et al., 2017). Cross-gender friendship patterns do not differ significantly by age group (Wu & Keeter, 2003), although there was some indication that women were somewhat less likely than men to report having opposite sex best friends as they grew older. Younger adults report greater average network size than middle aged and older adults (Fiori & Smith, 2015; Wenger, 2014); however, this does not mean that older adults lack social connections or spend less time interacting with others. Rather, it suggests that older adults often prioritize quality over quantity when selecting companions—an orientation supported by findings from our focus groups.
