Precise Control: Closed-loop control systems can achieve very precise control over the process variable (PV), as they use feedback to adjust the manipulated variable (MV) in response to changes in the controlled variable (CV). This results in stable and consistent performance.\n2. Disturbance Rejection: Closed-loop control systems can effectively reject disturbances that may affect the process, such as external noise or sudden changes in input parameters. These disturbance rejection capabilities make closed-loop control systems more robust than their open-loop counterparts.\n3. Stability Improvement: By using negative feedback to regulate the output signal, closed-loop control systems can improve stability in the process being controlled. In contrast, an open-loop control system might become unstable under certain conditions due to the lack of feedback.\n4. Reduced Overshooting: When there is a change in setpoint (SP), the closed-loop control system will try to reduce the error between SP and PV, which helps minimize overshooting problems associated with the system settling time. Open-loop control systems often suffer from significant overshooting when dealing with rapid changes in input variables.\n5. Compensation for System Nonlinearities: Closed-loop control systems can employ different techniques like lead-lag compensators or Smith predictors to compensate for nonlinearities present in the system dynamics. Such linearization methods help maintain good control even in highly complex processes where linear approaches fail.\n6.
