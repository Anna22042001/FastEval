The strength of binary acids can be predicted by the electronegativity of the central atom, the strength of the acid HX, and the electron-donating ability of the Y-atom. Of the compounds listed, H2Se > H2S due to the smaller size of sulfur which allows for more efficient overlap of the orbitals and more effective creation of an electron-deficient compound. The small size of oxygen allows for it to be a more effective electron-donor molecule than hydrogen, and therefore increases the strength of the acid H2O.
