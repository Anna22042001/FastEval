Sometimes this insult can be meant as an endearment or a way to make fun of a friend without being too serious. It could also be interpreted as expressing frustration towards someone who lacks knowledge about something specific, like technology or sports, but not necessarily as a reflection on their intelligence level overall. However, context and tone of voice would matter when delivering such statement, because there are many ways to say \"you are so dumb\" and convey different messages. Depending on how they were said, these words could come across more playfully than offensively, which is why people may use them ironically even between themselves. Still, using the word retarded, as well as its derivatives, as an insult has been criticized by some organizations, including Special Olympics, as discriminatory against intellectually disabled individuals. Words that demean or stereotype any group based on disability should always be avoided.
