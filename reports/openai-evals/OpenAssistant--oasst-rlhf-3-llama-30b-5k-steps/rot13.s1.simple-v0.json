And now that you know the conversion scheme, you can probably try to decode it yourself.\n\nThere are much better encryption algorithms and practices that are now considered standard in the industry and much more difficult to crack, such as AES with a 256-bit keysize, which is much harder to crack through brute-force.\n\nIf you have any more security practice questions or concerns, feel free to ask. ^_^", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant.
