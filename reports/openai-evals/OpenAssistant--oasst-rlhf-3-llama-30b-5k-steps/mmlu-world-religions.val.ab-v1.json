Ghandi is most noted for his non-violent methods, where he encouraged his followers to \"Be The Change\" when advocating for their rights, freedoms, and beliefs. This was not always easy, but it was always done with an inner power, an inner strength that comes from the practice of non-violence.\n\nGhandi's non violent approach resulted in India gaining her independence from Britain after 200 years of rule as well as uniting India's Muslim and Hindu populations for the cause, in what can only be described as a miraculous way. \n\nThis could be the reason why some refer to him as Mahatma, and/or an enlightened Soul.
