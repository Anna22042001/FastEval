It was adopted by several leaders in India as part of their name, including Gandhi himself (whose original given name was Mohandas Karamchand). The term derives from Sanskrit mahātmā (great + soul), which first appears in the Bhagavad Gita and other Indian scriptures. Other notable people who have been addressed by this title include Swami Vivekananda, Sri Chinmoy, and Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj.\nThe choice between B and D depends on whether one considers a political leader who has gained personal realisation to be an exceptional case or not. However, C seems preferable because it avoids ambiguity over whether 'leader' refers to someone in a position of authority or someone with influence among a particular community of followers.

In the early church, deaconesses were established to minister to female converts who had been baptized but needed further instruction and care before being received into the community (Acts 9:36-42). The duties included preparing them for baptism by teaching them about faith in Christ and encouraging repentance from sin, praying for the sick, and helping those who were materially poor or widowed (Romans 16:1; 1 Timothy 5:9–10). As their needs grew more complex over time, additional roles emerged such as managing finances and caring for children within the congregation. By the second century AD, some deaconesses became more like modern nuns who lived celibate lives devoted entirely to service within their communities. While Scripture does not establish an office of deaconess, it teaches principles for appointing qualified servants who support the work of ministry leaders so that they can focus on prayer and preaching (Acts 6:1–7). Since deacons are expected to be “husbands of one wife” (1 Timothy 3:12), appointing women to this role could allow wives of other believers to also serve. Some churches today have reinstituted deaconesses based on these biblical patterns, while others prefer alternative names for similar positions without using the term “deacon.” Ultimately, what matters most is whether people filled with compassion for others will step forward to help meet needs in ways consistent with Scriptural priorities and values.

Wuwei, often translated as \"non-doing\" or \"not acting\", refers to a key concept in Daoism that emphasizes the importance of being passive and yielding in order to achieve harmony with nature and attain inner peace. While other answers may have some relation to Daoist philosophy, they are not accurate descriptions of the meaning of wuwei specifically.\n\nHere's an additional explanation for further clarification:\n\nWuwei is one of the core concepts in Daoism, and it's closely related to another important idea known as ziran (自然), which translates to \"naturalness\". These two ideas together represent a central theme within Daoism - the importance of aligning oneself with the natural rhythms and processes of the universe, both physically and spiritually.\n\nThe practice of non-action in Daoism doesn't mean complete inactivity; rather, it involves cultivating the ability to act effortlessly without attachment or resistance. It's about learning how to flow with change instead of trying to control everything around you. This can involve letting go of expectations and desires, being present and mindful in each moment, and trusting in the natural unfolding of events. By doing so, one seeks to find balance between action and stillness, activity and rest, yin and yang. Ultimately, this approach to life is seen by many Daoists as the path towards true wisdom, enlightenment, and longevity. Does this help provide more context on the topic?

Jean Calvin was a French theologian who developed the doctrine of predestination, also known as double-predestination, in the Protestant Reformation. This teaching holds that God has already determined who will be saved and damned from eternity past, before any individual has had an opportunity to make decisions or respond to grace. This belief is closely associated with Calvinist soteriology (doctrine of salvation), which teaches that justification (being made right with God) comes by faith alone apart from works, through Christ's atonement on behalf of his elect people. The other options listed are not major emphases within Calvin's work: miaphysitism is a Christological doctrine held by Oriental Orthodox churches; glossolalia refers to speaking in tongues, often associated with Pentecostal movements since the early twentieth century; transubstantiation is the Catholic Church's view of Eucharistic change whereby bread becomes Jesus' body and wine transforms into his blood during mass, first officially endorsed by Thomas Aquinas at the Council of Constance c. 1415.\n\nThe most well-known summary of Calvin's thought regarding salvation appears in his Institutes of the Christian Religion , published in several editions between 1536 until final version in 1559, shortly after his death . In this book he explains how individuals receive God's favor (i.e. election): \"Predestination we call the eternal decree of God, by which He has determined in Himself what He would have to become of every individual creature whom He has willed to bring into existence\" (Institutes III.xxi.5).

It advocated that the Japanese emperor should be considered divine, rejecting both Chinese Confucianism and Buddhism as foreign influences.\n\nKokugaku ideas were embraced by some intellectuals, such as Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801). They held that Japan had always been an isolationist nation state (shintō kokka) and that its traditional culture was based on the worship of gods called kami, the foundation of Shintoism. The ideas developed during this time set the basis for many of the modern interpretations of Shintoism. However, not all scholars agree to view Kokugaku as a precursor of State Shinto or to describe it as being \"nationalistic\". Some see Kokugaku as more of a rediscovery of the ancient religion combined with ethnic nationalism rather than simply a creation of the latter.\n\nThe movement was particularly interested in yamato-damashii (\"the soul/spirit of Yamato\"), and saw early historical records such as the Kojiki as key sources for understanding what they believed to be unique cultural values. Kokugaku writers generally ignored social realities, instead focusing their analysis at the abstract level of myths and rituals.\n\nIn modern times, these ideas have become associated with right-wing political ideologies, especially those connected with ultranationalism and Japanese imperialism; however, in its original formulation, Kokugaku did not have significant political connotations.
