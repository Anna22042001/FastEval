The Ten Commandments begin with recognition of God as the supreme authority and include prohibitions on idolatry, blasphemy, and murder. The Ten Commandments also lay out various other religious and moral instructions, including the requirement to honor one's parents, the prohibition on adultery, and the requirement to not lie or covet. Each of the Ten Commandments reminds believers that morality comes from God, and therefore morality is not subjective. The Ten Commandments provide guidance for living a life that is pleasing to God in a comprehensive way that touches nearly every area of life, including spiritual life, economic life, and family life. The Ten Commandments are a common topic of both theological discussion and philosophical debate, especially in light of their implications for freedom and morality.
