When these gametes are combined during fertilization, we can end up with four different genotypic combinations: BT (dominant homozygote), Bb (heterozygote), Bt (recessive homozygote), or any combination where both dominant alleles combine together. Since dominant traits mask recessive ones, only the first three possibilities matter for our purposes here. We know that in the F1 generation, the ratio of phenotypes observed was 3 blue : 1 green plants, so assuming that all plants that appear blue have either BT or Bb genotype, while all plants appearing green must carry at least one copy of bt. Therefore, we can conclude that among the 75% of blue plants, half of them must actually possess the Bb heterozygote genotype, since they may have inherited either paternal BT or maternal Bb allele. That means that the remaining 50% of the blue plants represent purebred dominant homozygotes (i.e., those that received both copies of BT from their parents).
