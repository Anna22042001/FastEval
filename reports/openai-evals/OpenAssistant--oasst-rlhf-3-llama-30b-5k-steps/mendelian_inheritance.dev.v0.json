The Green beetle has one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (g).\n\nThe F1 generation is a result of the interaction between the dominant allele (B) and the recessive allele (g) from the parents. Since the B allele is dominant over the G allele (B > G), all individuals in the F1 generation will show the dominant phenotype (Green). However, they will have a heterozygous genotype (BG).\n\nWhen we cross two F1 individuals (BG), we get a distribution of phenotypes in the F2 generation. Since the G allele in the F1 individuals is recessive, it cannot dominate the B allele. Therefore, the offspring will exhibit either the heterozygous genotype BG or the homozygous dominant genotype BB (Blue). The same logic applies to the recessive allele g, which cannot dominate over B or G. Therefore, the F2 generation will exhibit the recessive phenotype (Turquoise) only if the offspring has a homozygous recessive genotype (gg). Thus, the distribution will be 1/2 BG (Green), 1/2 B_ (Blue), and 1/4 gg (Turquoise).", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "One type of beetle has 3 possible wing colors, blue, green and turquoise.
