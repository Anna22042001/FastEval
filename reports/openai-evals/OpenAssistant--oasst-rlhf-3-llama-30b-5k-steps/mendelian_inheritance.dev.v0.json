We are given a monohybrid inheritance pattern, which means that only one of these alleles is being passed down from each parent to their offspring. The dominance pattern is B > G > T, which means that a blue beetle (B) will always have blue wings, a green beetle (G) will have wings that are a mixture of blue and green, and a turquoise beetle (T) will have blue wings.\n\nWe are then given the parent phenotype (two blue beetles) and the distribution of phenotypes in the F1 generation (3/4 blue and 1/4 turquoise). From this information, we can determine that the parent genotypes are likely to be either BB or B_ (where \"B_\" indicates that one or both of the parents could have the blue allele).\n\nTo find the genotypes of the offspring in the F1 generation, we need to consider all possible combinations of the three alleles. Since the dominant allele (B) will always express the blue phenotype, we have three possibilities for F1 individuals: BB_, B_T_, and B_G_. These individuals will express the dominant B allele and the recessive T or G alleles, respectively.
