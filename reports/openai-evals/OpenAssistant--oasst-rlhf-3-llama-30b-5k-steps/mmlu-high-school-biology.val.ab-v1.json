When the Sun’s energy heats up this water into vapour form, it rises into the higher levels of the atmosphere where the temperature drops considerably. At these high altitudes, the gaseous water molecules lose energy and condense back into tiny droplets forming clouds. These clouds trap the infrared radiation emitted by Earth’s surface hence preventing it from escaping into space resulting in global warming. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat in the lower atmospheric layers whereas water vapour concentrated at the upper troposphere plays a crucial role in regulating climate change. Apart from the above mechanism, there is another way through which water vapour contributes towards global warming: when carbon dioxide levels rise in the air, plants absorb more CO2 while emitting extra water vapour through transpiration. This excess moisture in turn leads to increased cloud formation that further magnifies the effect of greenhouse gases! \nSo, we can conclude that water vapour has two distinct yet interrelated roles: 1) It influences the amount of incoming solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface and 2) Its presence impacts cloud formation and thus controls how much", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following statements about photosynthesis is incorrect?\nA) O2 is a product of the light-dependent reactions.\nB) Photosystems I and II both play a role in the cyclic light reactions.\nC) CO2 is an input to the Calvin cycle.\nD) H2O is an input to the light-dependent reactions.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:15:03.274539+00:00"}

This answer option states a fact about hawkmoths and hummingbirds, but it doesn't explain why one option is least valid among others. Therefore, this option seems appropriate for an MCQ question asking \"which of the following is LEAST valid?\" The more detailed explanation follows below:\n\nThe reason option (C) is incorrect is because both organisms may be examples of convergent evolution - which means they independently evolved similar traits as adaptations to their respective environments or lifestyles. However, while convergent evolution is one possible explanation for similarity between unrelated species like hawk moths and hummingbirds, there could also be other reasons such as analogy, competition/mimicry, symbiosis etc. Each possibility would need to be evaluated based on evidence specific to these two taxa before any firm conclusions can be drawn regarding cause(s). Option A seems most relevant since hawk moth proboscis appears to mimic elongated bird bill or hummingbird long tongue for feeding from flower tubes or nectar sources; though it is not impossible some degree of natural selection influenced morphology too via survival advantages conferred by longer proboscis length. In contrast to A), B seems less likely due to differences in geographical distribution and habitats occupied by hummers vs moths, although shared tropical environments might contribute indirectly through effects on flower forms & abundance that influence pollinator ecology regardless of phylogeny. So even if we don't know for sure whether analogy or convergence applies here, at least now we understand what information each choice provides versus what they omit - so hopefully you feel better equipped to evaluate strengths & weaknesses of those options yourself!
