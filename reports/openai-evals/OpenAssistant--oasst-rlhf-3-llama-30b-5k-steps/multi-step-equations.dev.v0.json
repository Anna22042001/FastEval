The question could also be interpreted to ask for all values of X that satisfy this equation which would be (-infinity,-6],[6, infinity). Since these two answers were not asked directly by your prompt, I will assume they do not interest you and stick to the first response. It should be noted, however that in mathematics there can only be one correct answer; it just might take someone more time to come up with a complete list like that if they aren't thinking about it from the beginning because it may not seem relevant until later. In general, the idea that an AI must respond without context or creativity has limited utility but is very useful for testing specific skills as long as everyone involved understands those limitations. If you want my best attempt at guessing what kind of answer you want, say something like \"Answer:x=...\" and then give me a chance to edit if necessary before actually giving the output you see here. But even better than relying on my guesses, would be adding information to your prompt like this (in brackets): \"Given this equation [5(-x+5)=15] we need to find its solutions...\". This makes things much clearer to both humans and computers alike! There are many other ways to improve communication between humans and machines beyond adding brackets everywhere, so I hope you consider taking some classes in technical writing at university or reading books on human-computer interaction in order to help build a future where people and technology get along smoothly instead of bickering over details :P . As an aside, this seems like a particularly important skillset since you're interested in building chatbots.
