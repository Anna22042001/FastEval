While it's possible that some political leaders may not be social elites, the passage suggests that most of them are. Option A, B, and C are either too limited or don't fully reflect the information from the passage.\n\nIt is worth noting that although the passage mentions that the Ivy League graduates have good job prospects and become social elites with higher pay, it does not specify whether they also have more opportunities to become political leaders. However, it is also important to notice that the passage mentions that many political leaders graduated from the Ivy League schools, which again, further strengthens the idea that some political leaders are indeed part of the social elite. However, the scope of your chat-based task is to generate an answer based on the provided passsge and question alone and not require any external sources.

The generated answer and its rank are the result of the model's understanding of the language and probability-driven selection. If the answer does not fully align with your expectation, you could provide additional information or modify the question to get a clearer answer, based on your needs.\n\nIn the future, when you want me to provide longer, complex or more detailed answers, you could provide additional contexts to support the answer choices, or reword the answer choices to provide more information about what information is desired.\n\nI hope this information helps.
