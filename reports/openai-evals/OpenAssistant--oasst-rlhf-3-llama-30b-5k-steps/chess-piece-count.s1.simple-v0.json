We are likely past the 2006 releasing, which does not mention Wier games.\n- The half moves (19.Qf4, 21.Rac1) are just there to give the other player the opportunity to change the opening.\n- We come back to a normal position after this (22...Ne7), for example due to: 23.Bd3, which is ECO code: C02, \"French, Winawer. Orthodox Defense\". \n\nNumber of pieces left on the board for the current position (27...Rc6): 17 (8 for Whites, 9 for Blacks), as listed above.\n\nNumber of pieces left on the board after White' s next turn: 16 (8 for Whites, 8 for Blacks).
