If both quantities exist and all the hydrogen was in the form of gaseous diatomic hydrogen (which is how hydrogen is sold for welding) it would take 25 liters of hydrogen to equal 11 pounds, and 2.61 liters of diatomic hydrogen equal one pound.

If you want me to calculate which is heavier, 20 kilograms of any two metals use the chat for it. If the number of liters isn't exact, I could make a mistake.

In everyday life, mass is often expressed in terms of weight, such as \"I weigh 150 pounds\". However, this does not mean that weight is the same as mass. The strength of gravity makes weight a more suitable measure of mass for most everyday purposes. One pound (or one kilogram) is the unit of mass.
