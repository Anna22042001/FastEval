Today I gifted her one and she shouted 'Finally I found my king'.\"\n2: \"Once someone told me the reason behind mango being the king of fruits is because it was the only fruit which comes with its own bowl.  I looked at banana and thought it must be the peel that makes mango insecure.\"\n3: \"I was looking for a mango shaped bowl to impress my girlfriend.

Ba-dum-tsss.\"\n6: \"My friend was bragging about mango being the king of fruits, and that no other fruit can compete. I then showed him the mango-grapes crossbred and told him don't test the king everytime buddy.\"\n\nNote: Please tell me if any of these jokes are considered inappropriate before presenting them and let me know if you want another one to replace it, if I should not present them.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning to be sure that your conclusion is correct.
