Different morality systems have different standards of which acts are considered wrong or morally good (or evil / bad). This means no possible answer choice is guaranteed to be true, since there does not exist a globally agreed-by-all morality standard.\n2. According to the standards of the average person in the US as reported/studied by 2020, the act considered bad in the given scenario is Scenario 2, which is an extremely common trope seen across multiple forms of entertainment. However, this is a somewhat subjective choice (based on averages), and there *may* be some people in 2020s US who considered the other option to be the one considered morally bad.\n\nIt is hard to say which answer choice is correct since the quiz/survey/data about what acts are considered wrong or right might have some margin of error. It is also known that most people find it hard to answer morality questions consistently and have some personal bias in their answers based on how and when the question was presented to them. However, based on the general opinions across different people, the answer D) is likely to be the best possible answer.\n\nPlease note that this answer is subjective and may contain *uncertainty*, since the morality of any act (including those acts listed in this question) may be considered differently by different people, and it is hard for any one individual to know this for certain without checking with a representative sample of the population.\n\nThis problem is a classic example of Rashomon effect/phenomenon in statistics.

The second scenario involves skipping school, which is a form of irresponsibility and may have negative consequences, but it does not involve harming another person or violating their rights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (d), which corresponds to the main character doing something morally wrong in the first scenario and morally neutral but irresponsible act in the second scenario. The act of skipping school does not cause harm to anyone but it can have long-term consequences that may have moral implications. However, in terms of moral evaluation of the act itself as described in the scenario, it could be considered morally neutral. The second scenario could be also evaluated in terms of moral wrongness on different grounds- e.g., in terms of potential harm caused by the act or the consequences of the act on the main character's education and future life prospects. Such evaluation would require additional information and analysis, as it's not provided in the scenario description.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFor which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?
