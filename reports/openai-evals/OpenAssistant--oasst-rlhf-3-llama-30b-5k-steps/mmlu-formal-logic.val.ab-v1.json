However, it cannot simultaneously be true both that “J” holds and that its negation does not hold (i.e., “~J” is false), since these statements contradict one another.

The conclusion follows from the premises by Modus Tollens. If A implies non-B or non-equivalent C, then it also implies non-C or non-equivalent D since B is equivalent to D. Therefore, if A is true and B and D are both true, then either C must be false or not equivalent to D. However, in this case, we know that C is true, so the only possibility left is for D to be false. Thus, given the premise \"B ≡ D,\" the negation of D can only occur if B is false, which contradicts our assumption that B and D are both true. Since there are no possible circumstances under which the conclusion could be false while all the premises are true, the argument is valid. There's no need to consider any other cases because once you find one scenario where the argument holds, the proof is complete. That said, feel free to double check my work by verifying whether the argument remains valid across various combinations of truth values; hopefully, you will see why I came up with this particular example! You might come up with some more interesting scenarios once you try different configurations. Just remember that truth tables are very useful in determining validity but don't always uncover hidden logical relationships between propositions explicitly, especially those involving conditional statements, implications, biconditionals, etc., which depend on specific formal definitions and rules of inference. We often rely on intuition and informal reasoning or make assumptions about how these connectives should behave according to common sense or colloquial usage. Sometimes arguments turn out to be valid even though they seem fishy at first glance, or vice versa, depending on whether they satisfy certain criteria or match particular conditions required for logical soundness or unsoundness.

The two statements \"A implies not-B\" and \"B implies A\" do not imply each other when negated (i.e., if one is false then so too is the other). Therefore, they cannot be either logically equivalent or contradictory. They can still both be true simultaneously, in which case we would say that they were consistent. For example, this could happen if there exists an interpretation where A is true, while at the same time ~B is also true; such as the statement: \"if it rains today, then the sun will rise tomorrow,\" and the statement \"the sun rose yesterday.\" These two sentences are consistent because they do not contradict each other even though one does not imply the other. However, they would no longer be consistent if one added additional premises to them, e.g. adding the premise \"it did not rain today\" makes these two sentences contradictory since one says it will rain tomorrow whereas the other states that it did not! Hence, consistency must always be evaluated based on all available information. This example shows how seemingly unrelated statements may become more related once more context about the world is considered. Here, it was the additional assumption that rain had occurred. It is possible that further assumptions might make any pair of statements mutually dependent. So, checking for consistency requires considering all implications of a set of statements. Finally, some may wonder why I used \"not-B\" instead of just saying \"B\". While perhaps pedantic, doing so helps emphasize that the negation of an English sentence like \"It will rain today\" actually means \"Not(it will rain today),\" i.e. \"It will not rain today.\" We use double negative words like \"will not\" explicitly within natural languages precisely because without them we find ourselves unable to construct a meaningful negation (try saying \"Not-Romeo loves Juliet\" aloud without", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\n Construct a complete truth table for the following pairs of propositions.
