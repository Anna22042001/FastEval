The breakeven prices for the $157.5 strike price call are $157.5 and $173.46.  Please note that the $147 strike price put has two breakeven prices because it was bought and sold, so the net cost of the transaction would be $147- $101.04 = $45.96.  Also, the $170 call was sold, so the breakeven price would be $0.  The answer is [-$45.96, $140, $147, $0, $101.04, $157.5, $173.46]. I sorted this answer from lowest to highest. As this answer indicates, whether the net costs of these transactions are losses or gains depends on future share prices. If the shares fall to $101.04, the profit from that transaction would help offset losses from the other transactions. If the shares rise to $173.46 the profit from that transaction would help offset losses from the other transactions. At the end of the day, whether these transactions will end up a gain or losses depend on how well the price of shares rise, or how well prices fall.
