This can involve labeling or manipulating cells at early stages of development so that their progeny can be identified and followed as they divide and differentiate into various tissues and organs. By doing this, researchers can gain insights into how different cell types arise from common precursors, how patterns are formed within tissues, and how defects in these processes may contribute to diseases such as cancer.\n\nOther options listed in the question are not relevant to cell lineage tracing:\n\n* A) The sequence of enhancers for developmental genes relates to the control of gene expression rather than cell lineage. Enhancers are DNA elements that increase the activity of nearby genes by interacting with transcription factors bound to them. Knowing the sequences of enhancers does not directly reveal information about cell lineages.\n* C) Genetic mapping of regulatory genes for an organism involves identifying the chromosomal locations of genes that control particular traits or biological pathways. Again, this is related to understanding gene function rather than tracking cell fates.\n* D) Cellular signaling mechanisms involving membrane proteins play important roles in many physiological processes but do not directly relate to cell lineage determination.

In a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of heterozygotes (carriers) for an autosomal recessive allele is given by p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 where p and q are the frequencies of the dominant and recessive alleles respectively. Given that the incidence of this disorder is 1 in 6400 we know that q^2 = 1/6400 so q = sqrt(3)/sqrt(6400). Therefore, p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 becomes p^2 + 2*sqrt(3)*p + 9/6400 = 1 or to simplify things: (p - sqrt(3))^2 = 9/6400. Solving for p gives p = 7/40, therefore the carrier frequency would be about 1/40. However, note that this assumes no selection pressure on this disease so the true frequency may differ if selective pressures have been at play. Also recall that these calculations assume that each locus is independent; if linkage effects occur then you will need to take those into account as well when trying to determine actual vs expected carrier rates.\n\nIn general it can sometimes help to reason through these problems step by step using algebra first before plugging everything into formulas to avoid mistakes due to lost significant figures when performing arithmetic operations!
