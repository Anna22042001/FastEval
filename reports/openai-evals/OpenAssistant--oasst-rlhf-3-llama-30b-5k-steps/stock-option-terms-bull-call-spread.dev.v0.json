This is a bullish strategy where the investor expects the stock price to appreciate but not beyond a certain level. The strategy involves selling a call option with a strike price that is higher than the purchase price of the stock and buying a call option with a strike price that is lower than the purchase price of the stock. In this case, the investor is selling a call option with a strike price of $300 for $1.27 and buying a call option with a strike price of $275 for $10.30. Here is the classification for this trade:\n\nClassification: Call ratio spread.\n\nThe goal of this trade is to benefit from the difference in the premiums of the two options. The net credit received from the sale of the $300 call will be used to off set the cost of purchasing the $275 call, hence the name ratio spread. The max loss is limited the difference between the two strikes minus the credit received and the max gain is limited to the difference between the two strikes plus the net credit received.
