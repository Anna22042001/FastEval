To claim that humans have a superior ethical status to animals is to claim that it is morally wrong to give the interests of humans greater weight than those of animals in deciding how to behave. This statement represents view that moral status of every individual should be treated equally. However, this statement does not mean that moral status of individual human or animal should be regarded as equal, but rather that the interest of every individual should be taken into consideration.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the word \"superior\" itself carries connotations of hierarchy and domination. Giving one group a \"superior\" moral status in contrast to another group of animals can be interpreted as granting permission to exploit or abuse the latter. Alternatively, some may argue that humans do have a greater ability to understand and appreciate ethical concepts, such as justice and equality, which places a greater responsibility on humans to act ethically towards animals.\n\nIt's also worth noting, that the idea that humans have a superior ethical status to animals is controversial and debated topic in ethics and moral philosophy. According toUtilitarian approach, every being that can experience pleasure or suffering should be taken into moral consideration.
