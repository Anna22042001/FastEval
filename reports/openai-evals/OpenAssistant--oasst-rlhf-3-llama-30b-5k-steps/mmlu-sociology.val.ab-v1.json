This includes inequalities in social class, gender, and race. The functionalist theory argues that inequality serves specific social functions, such as motivating people to work harder.

It was a management approach developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that aimed to increase efficiency in manufacturing by breaking down jobs into smaller, more specialized tasks and using tools and technology to optimize the production process. This approach emphasized scientific methods such as time and motion studies, standardization, and the use of statistical analysis to analyze and improve work methods. \n\nWhile Scientific management did involve motivation and rewards for productivity, this was not its primary focus. Instead, it aimed to increase efficiency by finding the optimal way to perform each task, which included determining the most efficient way to perform each task, and then providing workers with the tools, methods, and training to perform the task in this optimal way. While this approach to management has been criticized for its focus on efficiency and its perceived lack of concern for worker satisfaction or motivation, the goal was to improve productivity and efficiency through scientific methods, not simply to motivate or reward workers for their performance.\n\nThe following are some correct statements about Scientific management, and provide more information of what scienti", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nScientific management involved:\nA) motivation and rewards for productivity\nB) the measurement and specification of work tasks\nC) all of the above\nD) the subdivision of labour into small tasks", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 23:56:21.975008+00:00"}

The Education Act of 1944 also known as the Education Act 1944, is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that created a system of free secondary education for all, and also enacted that all children must attend school until they are 15 years old. Under this Act, county grammar (secondary) schools and county secondary schools were established to provide education for all pupils who passed the 11-plus examination.\n\nThe Act also introduced services for children who find the standard school curriculum difficult. To this end, the Act envisioned the establishment of three types of school with broader remits than was traditional. Secondary technical schools, secondary modern schools and secondary grammar schools are collectively referred to today as secondary schools. Although parity of esteem for the three types of school was a goal when this legislation was created, this equality of esteem has yet to be achieved.\n\nThis act also created specialist services for children with disabilities, although in the 1940s these mainly related to physical impairments.\n\nDuring the passage of the Act through Parliament, the government agreed to create a system of direct grant schools. These were existing fee-paying schools which could apply to become direct grant schools administered by the state rather than fees-charging schools administered by independent school governing bodies. It was intended that these would be fully state-funded by the early 1950s, the fee-paying element of the independent schools simply tapering away over 12 years rather than all at once.
