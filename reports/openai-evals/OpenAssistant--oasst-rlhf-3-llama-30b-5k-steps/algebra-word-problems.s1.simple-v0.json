With the increasing availability of reading materials, the amount steadily increased to 5 books per week. How many books does Betty borrow per week currently?\nBetty has been going to libraries twice a week for 5 hours so that means 2*5 = 10 hours\nAfter the increase in availability of reading materials, Betty has been going to the library twice a week for 5 hours for a while until the amount steadily increased to 7 books per week\nThis means for a while Betty has been borrowing 7-5=2 books per week extra for 10 hours per week\nIn total that means 2 books per week + 5 books per week before = 7 books per week.\nCurrently Betty borrows 7 books per week from the library.
