This is because if the weights are initialized to a small value and then trained for a long time, it will result in the gradients becoming very small and the weights changing very slowly. On the other hand, if the weights are initialized to a big value such as 1.0, the gradients become big and the optimization process is not stable. Therefore, it is usually better to initialize the weights to a small but non-zero value.\n \nThe reason for setting a non-zero bias is that the bias term can be seen as a threshold for the activation function. If the bias were set to zero, the activation function would be flat, and the neuron would only be able to output one of two values (0 or 1). With a non-zero bias, the activation function becomes more like a step function, and the neuron can output a wider range of values, which allows for better fitting of different curves.\n \nThe best way to set the bias would be to set it to the average of the weights (including biases) multiplied by their corresponding input values. However, this method requires computing the weights and input values, so it is usually not done in practice. In practice, a bias of 0.1 is usually set as the default bias, and weighs initialized with -0.1 and 0.1 should be used.\n\n \nWhat specific step of training a neuron model would you like to discuss?

However, the degree to which the MAP estimate reduces the variance depends on the complexity of the underlying distribution and the quality of the prior knowledge used in the estimation process. Therefore, in some cases, the variance of the MAP estimate may in fact be higher than that of the MLE. But in most cases, the MAP estimate will have a lower variance than the MLE.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Lower.\n\nNote that Bayesian methods can be more interpretable than frequentist methods, as they can provide posterior distributions that represent the probabilities of different parameters given the observations and prior information. These distributions can be useful for making more informative comparisons between models or for assessing the robustness of results to different prior assumptions. But the Bayesian methods also have their limitations, such as potential concerns about the objective prior choice and the difficulty in visualizing high-dimensional posterior distributions. Therefore, both Bayesian and frequentist methods have their strengths and weaknesses and should be evaluated based on the specific problem and research question at hand.\n\nTo learn more about Bayesian AI, you may consider the following resources:\n\n1.
