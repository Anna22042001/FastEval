To address this situation, you can try using techniques such as regularization or early stopping to prevent overfitting.

To understand this, let's start with the definition of MSE.\n\nMSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted values (ypred) and the true values (ytrue) for a given dataset. Mathematically, it is defined as:\n\nMSE = 1/n Σ (ytrue - ypred)^2\n\n\nIn the case of the one-parameter model, ypred = β_0. Therefore, we have:\n\nMSE = 1/n Σ (ytrue - β_0)^2\n\nRecall that we are evaluating the performance of a regression model using the MSE metric. The goal is to fit a function (model) to the data such that the sum of the squared errors is minimized.\n\n\nNow, since we are using the one-parameter model, we have only one parameter (β_0) in the model. To optimize this model, we will use gradient descent.\n\n\nThe half term in the definition of MSE is added because we are using the raw data from the dataset to fit the model, and each value in the dataset is affected by the presence of the half term. As a result, the weight of each datapoint in the optimization process should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.
