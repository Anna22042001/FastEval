This fallacy occurs when someone ignores, oveestatement, or misrepresents suppressed evidence to make an argument. By doing so, they ignore the most relevant evidence in the situation, causing others to be misled or to draw unjustified conclusions. This fallacy is different from other types of reasoning errors such as appeal topride because in the case of suppressed evidence, relevant evidence exists but is ignored, whereas other fallacies involve other types of flawed reasoning. It is important to avoid this fallacy by being explicit about what evidence is being examined and making a genuine attempt at understanding all relevant evidence. By being aware of this fallacy, we can more effectively evaluate the arguments we encounter. We should strive to seek out a wide range of relevant sources of information - including ones that challenge our existing beliefs - and to take a fair and reasonable amount of time investigating the evidence we rely on to make conclusions. By avoiding the fallacy of suppressed evidence, we can more effectively arrive at well-supported and defensible conclusions. By committing this fallacy, someone may be guilty of intellectual negligence or harmfulness. However, recognizing this fallacy is an opportunity to improve our reasoning skills and to approach the situation in a more effective and responsible way.\nThe two reasons why this fallacy is dangerous are: (1) this type of reasoning error can cause others to be misled and draw unjustified conclusions, and (2) it can obscure relevant evidence, leading to false conclusions and poor decision-making. One way that the fallacy of suppressed evidence can have dangerous or harmful consequences is if it results in policies or practices that cause harm to people or communities, or if it leads to inaccurate conclusions about the world and our place in it.
