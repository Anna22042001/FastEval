But you already knew this...\n\nTo find out more about Realism as a view of international relations, read on.\n\nFrom ancient times to the 20th century, and from the\njungles of South America to the slums of Europe, from the great empires to\nthe smaller city-states, empires have emerged from annexation of territory.\nThese empires have established hegemony over the territories they rule, often\nfrom a base of traditional military power. This hegemony has allowed for long\nperiods of stability in each empire as the territories under its control are often\nlinked by shared cultural values and political systems\n\nAs you are already familiar with the concept of power and national security from your days as a CIA analyst in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), this passage doesn't hold any new information for you. However, it provides a useful background for understanding the Realist school of thought.\n\nRealists believe that power is the central element of international politics. They view states as the most important actors in international relations and emphasize the distribution of power among them. Realists tend to explain important events such as war, alliances, and international organizations in terms of power, arguing that all states want to increase their power and avoid being dominated by more powerful states.\n\nFrom the Realist perspective, war is a common result of the international struggle for power. The distribution of power among states determines the likelihood of conflict, with wars more likely when there is a significant imbalance of power. Different states may try to change the balance of power by building up their own military capabilities, forming alliances with others, or using diplomatic strategies to persuade others to side with one state against another.\n\nThe international system is anarchic,", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAccording to Realists, what accounts for the onset of the Cold War?\nA) A power vacuum\nB) The expansionist nature of the Soviet Union\nC) Ideological differences\nD) Both b and c", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-18 22:04:28.957068+00:00"}

Domestic concerns of the US.\n\nI am a language model, not a revisionist or a historian, but according to some revisionist historians, the primary cause of the Cold War was the pressure on the US government to adopt a confrontational policy towards the Soviet Union due to public opinion and bureaucratic interests within the US. This pressure was driven by concerns about the spread of communism and the perceived threat posed by the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that different historians and political scientists often have different views on the causes of the Cold War, and there is no single \"correct\" answer beyond some being more correct than others in a generalizable sense. The cause of the cold war is still a heavily debated topic between revisionists and conservatives, where conservatives would argue there is no single cause, and revisionists hold the perspective that it was due to policy makers competing for bureaucratic interests and to appeal to the public. Some revisionists would put forth A. None of the above as a valid, if slightly nonsensical answer, to your query by arguing that the \"cause\" is the wrong question altogether.

While President George H.W. Bush had a somewhat tumultuous relationship with his British counterpart Margaret Thatcher, as seen in the transcripts and notes from their meeting on Dec. 3, 1989, the United States had a much more complex relationship with the Soviet Union.\n\nRelations with the USSR were a major aspect of Bush’s foreign policy. In the transcripts of meetings in London, England, and Paris, France, on Nov. 8, 1989, Bush notes that the U.S. is prepared to help the Soviet Union once it moves toward democracy. By Dec. 2, 1989, Bush states at a dinner speech, “A year of change is turning into a night of hope for billions. This is an epochal moment for freedom — a time when dictators tremble and we can do great deeds — we can act, not to make the world over, perfect the world, but to make it a better place.” These statements reflect one of the main tenets of Bush’s foreign policy: that the U.S. was committed to supporting democratic change in Eastern Europe and to aiding the collapsing Soviet Union in a transitional period.\n\nHowever, the dissolution of the Soviet Union also signaled the end of the Cold War era. Since the U.S. did not recognize the authority of the Soviet central government to control the restive Soviet\nrepublics, President Bush did not officially recognize their independence as they broke away from the Soviet Union.
