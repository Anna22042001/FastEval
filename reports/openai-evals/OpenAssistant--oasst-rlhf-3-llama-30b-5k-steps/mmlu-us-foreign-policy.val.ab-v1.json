The policy of containment was the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy during the early years of the Cold War. It aimed to prevent the spread of Soviet influence and communism around the globe, particularly in the developing nations of Western Europe and Asia. The policy was articulated in a series of speeches, articles, and policy memos written by a number of U.S. officials, including Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, diplomat George Kennan, and Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Of all these figures, Kennan is often considered the “father” of containment because he was the first to develop a comprehensive and cohesive strategy for countering Soviet expansion. In a confidential 1947 policy memorandum, Kennan outlined the need to “contain” Soviet influence by setting clear limits on where the United States would and would not tolerate Soviet expansion, and by offering economic and military aid to countries threatened by Soviet aggression. Kennan’s ideas helped shape the development of U.S. containment policy in the years that followed, and his concepts continue to influence U.S. foreign policy today.\n\nB) Truman Doctrine (1947): Also known as the Truman policy is a set of principles that sought to contain the spread of Soviet influence by providing military and economic aid to countries under Soviet threat or attack, particularly in Europe and Asia. Named after U.S. President Harry S. Truman, the Truman Doctrine has two main components: containment and “dollars for defense.” The “dollars for defense” component is a policy of providing economic aid to countries experiencing economic hardship or Soviet advance, in order to maintain Western influence in those countries and prevent them from falling under Soviet control.\n\nD) National Security Council (NSC): A", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWho is considered the “father” of containment?\nA) George Kennan\nB) Henry Kissinger\nC) John Foster Dulles\nD) Dwight Eisenhower", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 23:59:01.152779+00:00"}

Alexander Hamilton believed that protectionist tariffs on foreign goods would benefit domestic manufacturers. This policy, along with federal assumption of state debts, helped establish Washington's administration as a strong and credible government. As the first Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton drafted plans for the federal government to fund its debt and assumed state debts to establish a national credit in the form of bonds. The idea was to make the federal government more viable nationally, as opposed to relying on individual state lines. The first Report on Public Credit defended Hamilton's proposal by emphasizing that a national credit would promote the success of the Constitution, help create a stable economy, and increase the nation's wealth; to Congress in 1786, he argued that a national bank would provide the means to achieve those goals. This financial plan focused on funding federal debt at a lower interest rate, which would help encourage investors to buy government securities. The national bank would provide the nation's currency on behalf of the U.S. government, and establishing the national bank was a key piece of Hamilton's plan to create a national financial system. In addition, it would enable Congress to implement policies such as encouraging agriculture and manufacturing, funding internal improvements such as roads, canals, and lighthouses, implementing tariffs to fund the government, and earn seigniorage by putting money into circulation that would be spent on these federal projects, which Hamilton argued, would support the national budget.
