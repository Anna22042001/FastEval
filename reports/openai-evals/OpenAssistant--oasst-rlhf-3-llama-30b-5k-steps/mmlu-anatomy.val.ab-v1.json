Smooth muscles contain both actin and myosin fibers, which are organized into regular arrangements known as sarcomeres, similar to striated muscles such as skeletal or cardiac muscle tissue. However, unlike these other two types of muscle cells, smooth muscle sarcomeres lack the T-tubule system for signal conduction from sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\nWhile both A and B may appear plausible based on this information alone, C is clearly incorrect since some form of actin must be present (even if it's only a small amount), and D lacks sufficient support given that myosin is necessary for any kind of muscular contractions; therefore there must still exist at least one copy each of these proteins even if they are less common than actin. Finally, we can also eliminate option E because while all three options could theoretically apply under certain circumstances, there would be no conceivable situation where a cell type containing zero copies of either protein would exhibit significant contraction properties like those seen in smooth muscle tissues unless an alternative mechanism was discovered to replace these crucial components. For example, the slime mold protist \"Dictyostelium\" uses a unique system of cytoskeleton polymerization involving neither actin nor myosin yet somehow achieves rapid shape changes resembling pseudopod-based motility behaviors - though this behavior should not necessarily scale upwards when dealing with much larger organisms due to resource constraints and physical limitations imposed by dimensional scaling laws.

However, when infected or swollen tonsils become enlarged enough to block airways while sleeping, they can cause sleep apnea. In some cases, removing the tonsils may be necessary if this condition causes chronic problems breathing during sleep, especially in children. Although tonsils do not directly affect taste buds on the tongue as we age into our adult years, their removal usually does not affect how foods taste afterwards. The number of taste buds on the tongue remains relatively constant throughout life regardless of whether tonsils were removed surgically or naturally wear down over time due to aging. In fact, new research suggests it is possible to regenerate lost taste buds after injury from trauma or certain diseases, possibly offering hope for people whose sense of taste has been diminished from unrelated conditions such as head injuries or degenerative neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease.
