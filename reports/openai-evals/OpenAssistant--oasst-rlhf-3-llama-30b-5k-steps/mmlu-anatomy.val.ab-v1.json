Emissary veins connect the intracranial venous sinuses to veins draining the scalp and veins draining the eye. To add on to my previous answer, emissary veins are valveless veins that connect the intracranial venous system with the extracranial venous system. They allow blood to flow from the intracranial venous system to the extracranial venous system and back again. There are multiple locations on the skull where emissary veins can be found. These include the carotid canal (connects the internal jugular vein and the cavernous sinus), the foramen magnum (connects the occipital sinus and the vertebral venous plexus), and the petrous portion of the carotid canal (connects the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus). As I mentioned earlier, obstruction of these veins can result in venous hypertension and increased pressure within the intracranial venous system.
