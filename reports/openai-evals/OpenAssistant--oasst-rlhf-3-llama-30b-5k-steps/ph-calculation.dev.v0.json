This equation takes into account the equilibrium established between the undissociated acid (HA) and the dissociated hydrogen ion (H+) and the conjugate base (A^-). Since the solution concentration is 0.00007 M, we can assume the concentration of both undissociated acid and dissociated hydrogen ions is equal to 0.00007 (total acid concentration)/2= 0.000035 M which is much lower than the base concentration of 7 orders of magnitude so we can neglect it with respect to the base concentration giving pH = pKa + log (7/0.000035)=2.68."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-22 00:25:18.536575+00:00"}
