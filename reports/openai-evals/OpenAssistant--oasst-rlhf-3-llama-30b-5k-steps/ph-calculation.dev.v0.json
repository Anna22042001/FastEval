If a solution of an acid, as strong acid as monoprotic HR can be, reaches a concentration as low as 0.0005 M it will tend to not dissociate at all due to the insufficient number of active sites in the solvent. Therefore the concentration of H+ remaining unchanged, will make the pH equal to -Log10 [H+] = -Log10(0.0005) = 2.303 which is very close to the pKa of water. Thus, the effect of H+ ions on the pH will nearly entirely dominate over the others components of the solution, which will make the pH close to 1, the pH of a 0.05 M solution of HCl. This explains the high sensibility to the concentration value when working with such weak acid.\n\nIn addition, we must note that the value of dissociation degree (d/d) is given relative to pKa, and in water pH and pOH are considered equal. Hence using it to calculate the pH of a solution with a high value of d/d is close to being impossible. Here the pH of a 0.0005 M solution of monoprotic acid with a d/d of 0.2 becomes a 2.026. This shows that the pH of such weak acids are more sensitive to the d/d than the concentration, as we can observe a great difference between the value obtained with a dissociation degree of 0.2 or 0.1, or even between 0.05 and 0.15.\n\nFor more information and a complete answer please visit the following link: https://www.chem"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-18 22:38:21.326358+00:00"}

Since you know the concentration of the acid you could also calculate the pH without using the Henderson Hasselbalch equation:\nIn order to calculate the pH without using the Henderson Haselbalch equation you may use equation: pH + pKa= pKa +log [a.−]/ [H+]. \nSince we're only solving the equation for the pH this equation is sufficient to solve for pH.\n\nIt should be noted that when pH = pKa −log [a.−]/ [H+] = pKa is equal one. This equation means that when the solution has a pH equal to it's pKa it is in equilibrium this is an important concept when learning of acid solution equilibrium thus using the equation given earlier is important since it shows how the pKa and the pH are related in acid solution equilibrium.  A good way of keeping track of this relationship is by using the given equation and solving for it. Solving the equation at times other the pKa is important in order to understand the factors one would need to control when measuring out reactions that rely on strong vs weak acid. A common problem when you get further into studying inorganic chemistry of living systems is measuring the pH at certain places with-in said living systems. The use of weak acids/bases is one of the key concepts when studying Biochemistry that is used to measure said pH thus solving this equation for pH is important in order to understand what pH a weak acid will have when a living cells has an pH close to the pKa of said acid.

In this case, the dissociation degree of the monoprotic acid is 0.1, which means that only 10% of the acid molecules dissociate into hydrogen ions and conjugate bases. To calculate the pH of the solution, we can use the following equation:\n\npH = -log10([H+])\n\nwhere [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration.

Note that this answer is calculated using the formula for the pH of a monoprotic acid solution, which accounts for the concentration of the acid and the dissociation degree. The formula for the pH of a monoprotic acid solution is given by pH = -log10(1 - [OH-]/[HR]), where [HR] is the concentration of the acid and [OH-] is the concentration of the hydroxide ions. In this case, [HR] = 0.00003M and [OH-] = [H+] + [OH-], where [H+] and [OH-] are related by the equation [H+] + [OH-] = Kw, where Kw is the ionic product constant for water, which is equal to 1 x 10^-14. Therefore, [OH-] = Kw/[H+], which translates into 1 x 10^-2. Substituting [HR] and [OH-] into the pH formula yields pH = -log10(1 - 1 x 10^-2/3 x 10^-5) = 1.22, to one decimal place of precision.
