This process is highly dynamic.\n\nAt the end of cell entry, the virus has been internalized by the cell and has released its genetic material into the cytoplasm. Depending on the type of virus, this material may be DNA or RNA. This genetic material is then used to make new viruses. First, nucleic acid is replicated to make copies of the genetic material. Some viruses use their own enzymes to copy their nucleic acid, and others use host proteins. Finally, new viruses are assembled from copies of the genetic material and proteins. Assembly occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells in the case of DNA viruses and in the nucleus of cells in the case of many RNA viruses. Viruses undergo different mechanisms of budding.
