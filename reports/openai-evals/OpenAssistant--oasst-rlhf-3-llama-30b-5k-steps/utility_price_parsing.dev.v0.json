The quantity is given as 726kWh, and the factor is $0.0005 per kWh. To compute the cost per kWh, we multiply the quantity by the factor:\n726000 * 0.0005 = 3630\nThis gives us the distribution cost recovery factor.\n* The Distribution System Charge is for the use of the electric distribution system. The quantity is given as 726kWh, and the charge is $0.053 per kWh. To compute the cost per kWh, we multiply the quantity by the charge:\n726000 * 0.053 = 3859435.2\nThis gives us the distribution system charge.\n* The total electric delivery charges are the sum of the fixed price energy charge, distribution cost recovery factor, and distribution system charge.
