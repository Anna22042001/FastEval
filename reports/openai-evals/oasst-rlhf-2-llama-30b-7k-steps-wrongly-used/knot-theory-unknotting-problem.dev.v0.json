Knots that have more crossings are generally considered less likely to be the unknot. In this case, the given knot has 45 crossings, which is relatively high compared to other simple knots such as the trefoil (with 3 crossings) or the figure-eight knot (with 4 crossings). However, there exist knots with many more crossings that are still equivalent to the unknot.\n\nThe symmetry group: The symmetry group of a knot is a mathematical structure that describes its symmetries and rotations. A knot with no symmetries at all would be extremely unlikely to be the unknot. In general, simpler groups imply higher likelihood of being the unknot. However, knots with larger symmetry groups may also be the unknot.\n\nIntuition from geometry: While not a formal criterion for determining whether a knot is equivalent to the unknot, intuition based on geometric properties such as curvature, self-intersecting behavior, etc. may provide clues about the likelihood of a given knot being the unknot. For example, knots with fewer loops and less intertwined parts tend to be easier to untangle and thus more likely to be the unknot.\n\nBased on these criteria, while we cannot definitively say that the given knot is equivalent to the unknot without further analysis, we do not have strong evidence against it either.
