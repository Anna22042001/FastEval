As an aside, as Connect Four is a solved game (meaning best plays from both sides lead to a forced victory), humans usually don't follow these optimal strategies. Therefore your outcome may vary depending on whether your opponent follows those or not.\nIf you would like to ask more about Connect Four strategy, I could go into detail. It is actually quite interesting due to the parity idea used in determining the winner. Let me know!\nHere is some additional information on the subject in case you are interested:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four\nThe main article contains several sections including its history, rules, solutions (strategies) etc. Some notable bits include the fact that the game was invented by George W. Storey & Co in England and marketed for the public under the name 'Four Up', later changed to 'Connect 4' which we use today. Despite this origin, Hasbro now owns it because they bought out Milton Bradley Company, the American publishers behind the brand. When released in America, it contained some changes", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.

The winner's token can be placed on any square in that row, so it doesn't matter which space in the winning row was used as long as all four squares are occupied by tokens of the same kind. In this case, since there are two columns of four tokens already in place for both players, neither has won yet. However, if we were to add more rows to the grid, eventually one of them would win based on these rules. For example, if we added an additional column of seven spaces and filled it with random letters, one of the players might get lucky and manage to make a fourth row of four tokens in a different direction before the other player does. This process could continue indefinitely until someone wins by getting four tokens in a row. Since Connect Four games typically have a fixed number of columns, however, it's usually impossible to determine who would ultimately win without playing out every possible scenario. It's worth noting that even though human players often think carefully about strategy when deciding where to drop their next token, computers can easily calculate the optimal move for either player at each turn using algorithms like minimax search. With perfect play by both sides, many positions will lead to draws rather than decisive victories, but there are also some positions where one side has a clear advantage due to the layout of the pieces on the board. These types of analyses have led to various refinements of the basic Connect Four rules over time, such as allowing players to use multiple different colors of tokens or introducing special power-ups or bonuses that modify the standard gameplay mechanics.

In the third step (`0XX00XY`), neither player has won since there are no complete rows or columns. However, Player X now controls two adjacent columns (the first and fourth). This may suggest an advantage for Player X, but it does not guarantee victory.\n4. From the fourth step (`0XY00YX`), Player Y has created another full row and wins again. Output should be 'Y'.\n5. In the fifth step (`XXY0YXY`), neither player has won because there are no complete rows or columns. Both Players X and Y control two adjacent columns (respectively, the first and second vs. the fourth and fifth). These configurations do not guarantee victory, although they might create opportunities for future moves.\n6. Finally, in the sixth step (`YYXXXYX`), Player X has formed three consecutive pieces in the middle column (second, third, and fourth positions).
