The dryads are the nymphs of trees and forests. According to Hesychius of Alexandria, they were described as fairies (περίφθοροι) who lived in the forest. They danced with the satyrs and other creatures of the woodland; and had their altars in groves. Above all, they were associated with the oak tree and the apple tree, depending on location. As such, the ties between the two are strong enough for the dryad to be thought of as an apple or oak fairy, although it is not accurate to refer to a dryad as simply \"an\" oak fairy or \"a\" apple fairy. In Modern Greek folklore, the word \"dryas\" has been reconstructed as meaning \"nymph\", whereas the original oaken-nymphs of the medieval Roman tradition of Latin folklore have come to mean the opposite: i.e., a female being made of wood. In these modern traditions, therefore, there is no indication of any association of dryads with apples. Some tellings of the mythology surrounding them imply that they do have the ability to change into multiple forms including that of animals such as stags. It was said that those who saw them could gain great inspiration from the sight; conversely, to offend a dryad was certain to bring terrible dangers. If one of these fairies was killed by a human, she remained in his power until he gave her a proper burial ceremony or became cursed with bad luck. Offerings and prayers were also brought to placate these fairies when people began using resources from nature, such as", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Give the answer to this crossword clue, respecting the already placed letters which will be indicated after the clue.
