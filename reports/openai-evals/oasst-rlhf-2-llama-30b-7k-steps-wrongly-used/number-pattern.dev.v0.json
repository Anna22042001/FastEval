In this way，we know that the next number should be 24.96，so our answer is D。 Because the other choices are all larger than 24.96。In fact，none of them satisfy the conditions mentioned above。We only need consider the case that k=2，where n takes values from 1 to 3，and the common difference between two consecutive terms is always positive。Therefore，our answer must be D。 Other answers are too large compared to 24.96，hence none of them match our requirements。The process of answering this problem is quite similar to that used to solve questions on finding the differences between two terms for sequences。Thus，I believe that those who studied calculus before could figure out the correct solution directly without asking me！That's why I give such a short answer at first!

This means that each term can be obtained by multiplying (n-1) terms by 3 in the original sequence, n being the number of the term. The common difference between consecutive terms is therefore 3. We can obtain this sequence of numbers as follows:\n3 * 1 = 3，n=2\n3 * 2 = 6，n=3\n3 * 6 = 18，n=4\n3 * 18 = 54，n=5\n3 * 54 = 162，n=6\nTherefore, the next number should be equal to 3 * 162 = 486. And since we need to pick out a option among A、 B、C、 D, the answer must be C.\nIt's worth noting that there are actually infinitely many such sequences. For example, another set of such numbers could be found by starting at any multiple of 3, e.g., 9.

Therefore, to tell which set of numbers the above question refers to, some additional information is needed.
