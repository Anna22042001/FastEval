So the correct option among those listed is (B), CaCl2.\n\nIn case you were wondering about others:\n\n(A) Na2S will not cause any significant change to the pH because its conjugate acid (HS-) has a very low Ka value (10^-18), so almost no hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas will be produced and there won't be much [OH-].\n\n(C) NH4Br does not cause an alkaline solution either; ammonium ions reacting with water liberate hydroxide ion and hydrogen gas according to this equation:\n\nNH4+ + H2O → NH3 + NH4OH -> NH3 + NH4+ + OH-\n\nThis leaves only Cl- and [OH-], just like regular water (pH7) or slightly lower due to the added [NH4+].\n\n(D) NaClO4 also decomposes into Na+ and ClO3-, which further disproportionates to form Na+, Cl-, and ClO3-.

This corresponds to the definition of an atomic weight which represents the relative masses of all known isotopes of that element combined in their natural abundance. Option A is incorrect because the atomic mass of a carbon atom (which contains six protons and typically six neutrons in its nucleus), expressed in atomic mass units (amu), is around 12.00 u or 12.01 u depending on whether you are referring to carbon-11 or carbon-13 respectively. Option B is also wrong since an amu is defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 at rest and therefore cannot be used directly to express the mass of a given number of carbon atoms. Finally option C is incorrect because it suggests that there exists some kind of fixed relation between the number of atoms of an element and the mass of these atoms but this is not true, since different chemical elements have different atomic numbers and different binding energies among their respective isotopes.
