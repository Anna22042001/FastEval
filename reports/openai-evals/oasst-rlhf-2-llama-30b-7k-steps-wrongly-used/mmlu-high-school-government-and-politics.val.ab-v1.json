The media play a significant role in shaping the public agenda for election coverage by making editorial decisions about which issues are covered and how much attention is given to each one (Kaid, 2017). These decisions can have an impact on both citizen awareness and knowledge of the issues (McCombs & Shaw, 2018). By choosing what information to focus on, journalists effectively set the parameters of discourse around elections (Jamieson, 2005). Therefore, the media's ability to selectively promote certain topics or frame them in particular ways can shape the priorities that citizens adopt when they go to vote (Nicholson-Crotty et al., 2009). As a result, voters may be more likely to base their evaluations of candidates on these selected issues rather than other potentially relevant factors such as character or leadership abilities (Verba & Nie, 1972). Ultimately, this framing influence can lead citizens to make choices based on different criteria depending on whether the election concerns a national or local race (Lau & Pomper, 2003; McCombs et al., 2003).\n\nReferences:\n\n* Jamieson, K.

Unfunded mandates may also lead to unintended consequences such as reduced education spending at the state level due to increased Medicaid costs resulting from an increase in specialized services required by newly enacted federal law.

Others say that since it has been outlawed in many countries around the world, it can be considered \"unusual,\" which would render it unconstitutional under this reasoning. In any case, the Supreme Court ruled against the mandatory imposition of the death sentence (in Furman v Georgia), while allowing for it to be used at all in Gregg v Georgia; however, there have been numerous challenges made along these lines ever since then. Some proponents of the argument also point out that most industrialized democracies do not allow the death penalty, again suggesting that it could be seen as \"unusual.\" However, one might respond by saying that other nations are free to make their own decisions about how they wish to deal with such matters and that America need not follow suit simply because others choose not to implement the death penalty. Finally, the Eighth Amendment itself bars excessive fines and bails, which suggests that it was meant to protect individuals from abuses by government more than anything else.

Some committees recommend whether Congress should pass particular bills, but these decisions aren’t automatically ratified by the entire Congress—in fact, many recommended bills never get enacted into law. Vice presidents don’t participate in most committee votes, and when ties occur (which is rare), committees often recess so that members can lobby colleagues to change sides before taking another vote.

Congress’s power to make national policy is generally at its zenith when a president’s popularity wanes or when he/she is in his final term (or for those who are elected to only one term). When an administration starts losing public support or political capital, it will often use more extreme measures in order to regain that support, thus ceding some powers back to Congress. This may be done via executive orders, which can be reversed relatively easily. On the other hand, when a president enjoys strong support from voters, they will generally have more influence over Congressional actions and agendas. For example, after Obama was re-elected in November 2012, Congress passed several pieces of legislation favored by Democrats, including the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a relief package following Hurricane Sandy, and the confirmations of Richard Cordray to head up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) along with several judicial appointments. In short, there tends to be an inverse relationship between a president’s approval rating and his ability to get things done through Congress. However, this rule does not always hold true, especially if there is significant party polarization. If members of Congress feel confident about their own job security due to redistricting, gerrymandering, or incumbency advantages, then the president’s coattails may not be long enough to sway many votes. Moreover, if partisanship is particularly high, then lawmakers may simply vote against proposals because they were introduced by someone from another party — regardless of whether it aligns with their interests.

The reason that governments find it difficult to change entitlements is because there will always be strong opposition from those who receive benefits and oppose any reduction or modification in the program. This is not unique to just entitlement programs though; any policy proposal has to consider public opinion and this can create difficulties for governments implementing new policies generally. However, I would argue that A), B) and C) may also contribute as factors but not on their own. For example:\n\n- Programs designed to help farmers (entitlements) may have originally been designed to help rich white farmers historically, however modern day versions have evolved to support small family owned businesses too. So while A) was true historically, that doesn't mean it remains so today. Rich people still gain advantages under current farm subsidies but they don't exclusively do so anymore.\n\n- Some entitlement programs like Social Security are protected by Constitutional Amendment but many others aren't. Even where protection exists, the amendment itself can be changed. If enough people agree then an amendment can be drafted, proposed and ratified to alter or remove the existing protections. It's possible that B) could be used as a scapegoat by politicians who want to avoid blame for cuts to popular programs but ultimately they are accountable to voters. If an issue becomes important enough to swing votes then changes will happen regardless of what the Constitution says.\n\n- Defense spending is a huge expense for most countries and some entitlements might indirectly contribute towards military goals e.g. Veterans Affairs. But there isn't a direct link between these types of spending; one could exist independently of the other.
