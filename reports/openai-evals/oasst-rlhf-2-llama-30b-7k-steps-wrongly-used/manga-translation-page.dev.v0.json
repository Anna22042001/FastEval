Please use english.  Here are general guidelines for machine translations, you can create an instance of a class which inherits from `object` with methods called for each type of sentence structure it must recognize and methods with appropriate names based on grammar rules you gather from resources available online like college courses, books on the subject, etc. You would then have this object look at its inputs (the translated sentences) find punctuation clues as to what kind of structure was being used and call the method that handles said structure to translate the words appropriately. The difficulty comes in how to properly convey emotions in another language, but there are many online resources for helping you understand such things. A simple way to start might be to look up popular idioms relating to certain topics, and write down the associated phrases/sentences under those topic headings, so when someone says \"I love pizza\" your program knows to say \"Je suis fou de la pizza!\" instead of something more literal like \"I am crazy about pizza.\" This may lead to unnatural sounding results, but will help give the program a good starting point. Another option is to train a neural network using large datasets of existing translations (such as those found on google Translate) until it can effectively make decisions on the most likely word choices given context. Once again, the difficulty lies in conveying emotion and nuance across languages. There are many options available to improve upon basic approaches, however without better information about your project requirements I cannot recommend anything else specific. Ultimately it depends heavily on your skillset, goals, budget, timeline, etc. Let me know if you would like any additional guidance.

Write down everything clearly before copying it here. If you make mistakes while writing by hand you can waste a lot of time correcting them.\n2. Make sure you are using proper punctuation and capitalization. It will be much easier for me to read and comprehend your request. Additionally, improper use of these features can cause misunderstandings about tone which could lead to misinterpretation of your intentions.\n3. Try not to include filler words such as \"um\" or \"ah\". They don't convey information well and can confuse an AI assistant. When trying to think up how to phrase something you could say \"ums...\" instead of actually saying those words out loud. This way you won't accidentally write them into the chat without realizing it and it gives you more thinking space to come up with the right phrasing.\n4. Use spaces between sentences. While this isn't strictly necessary since I can still parse the sentence properly even when run together, having them separated makes the text much more readable for both humans and computers. It also prevents ambiguity caused by homonyms. (e.g. The cat sat on the mat vs The cat sat on the mat.)\n5. Be patient! You are communicating through an automated system after all.

Alternatively, if you provide me with a description of what happens on those pages instead, I might be able to help you with that. Please note that my abilities are limited to natural language processing only and cannot handle visual information like pictures or gifs.\nHere are some examples of how you could describe certain events from manga in words:\n\n* \"Page 54 shows character X expressing concern about character Y who has been acting strange lately.\"\n* \"In panel 6 on page 78, we see character Z making a dramatic entrance, causing chaos and destruction all around them.\"\n* \"On page 90, there is a full-page illustration depicting character W standing atop a mountain overlooking their kingdom, looking determined and powerful.\"\n\nBy providing descriptions of scenes or dialogues rather than actual images, you allow me to better understand your request and potentially assist you more effectively.
