Also, tax rates do change over time, and different states might have different rules and regulations regarding state and local taxes. So, while these types of questions are useful for general knowledge purposes, they should not be relied upon exclusively when making decisions related to personal finance or taxation. Therefore, it's highly encouraged to seek advice from a tax expert.\nIn addition to this, there are many variables involved in calculating a personal tax liability that cannot be accurately captured by a simple multiple choice question (e.g., filing status, other sources of income, deductions, credits).

The taxable income for someone earning $100,000 would depend on their filing status and other factors such as deductions and exemptions. However, assuming no deductions or exemptions, using the 2021 federal income tax rates, an individual who falls under the single filing status and has a taxable income of $75,000 (which is half of $150,000) would have a tax liability of approximately $16,203. Therefore, someone earning $100,000 would have a higher taxable income than $75,000, so we can estimate that the tax liability would also be greater. Using the estimated marginal tax rate of 24%, which applies to taxable income between $75,000 and $150,000 for individuals filing singly in 2021, we can approximate the tax liability for $100,000 to be around $26,393.
