Although there are some differences between them, Erasmus's efforts can be compared in certain respects to those of Johannes Gutenberg, who also played a significant role in making cultural products accessible to a broader audience. Both sought to democratize access to cultural materials: Gutenberg did so through printing technology, while Erasmus aimed to popularize classical literature and language through works like the Adagiorum Collectanea.

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nBased on Huizinga's description of Erasmus's career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of\nA) Christine de Pisan\nB) Johannes Gutenberg\nC) Martin Luther\nD) Francesco Petrarch", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 17:35:30.603189+00:00"}

The RCC used the sale of indulgences to fund various projects, including the construction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Critics argued that this undermined true repentance and forgiveness, making a mockery of spiritual penance. By attacking indulgences, Protestants sought to uphold the biblical teaching that justification comes solely through faith in Jesus Christ rather than monetary transactions or works-based righteousness.\n\n* Papal authority: Many Reformers accused the papacy of seeking too much control over political affairs and wielding excessive influence over monarchies. Some saw this as a violation of biblical teachings about church-state separation. Martin Luther famously declared, \"Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise,\" challenging the pope's authority during the Diet of Worms in 1521.\n\n* Celibacy: Priests were required to take vows of celibacy, which meant giving up marriage and sexual relations. While not unique to the RCC, this rule became a target for those who believed it created an unnatural lifestyle and fostered immorality among clergy. Advocates of married priests argued that allowing them would make the ministry more accessible and affordable while reducing scandals related to homosexuality and pedophilia.\n\nPluralism, however, generally refers to holding multiple positions or offices simultaneously, particularly within the context of government or politics.

Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland.
