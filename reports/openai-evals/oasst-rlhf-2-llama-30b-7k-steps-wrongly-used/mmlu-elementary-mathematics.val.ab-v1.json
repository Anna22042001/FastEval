Therefore when checking whether a proposed answer is correct it's necessary to verify that it satisfies all constraints imposed by the original problem. In some cases additional information such as initial conditions or other relations between variables may be needed to uniquely determine the solution. So even though I was able to provide the exact numerical answer here, it doesn't guarantee that the answer will always work for any related problems involving similar equations without further context or modification. For more complex problems that involve several variables, nonlinear or transcendental functions, etc., symbolic manipulation using algebraic rules may not produce explicit closed form solutions and instead may require numerical methods or approximations to obtain useful results.
