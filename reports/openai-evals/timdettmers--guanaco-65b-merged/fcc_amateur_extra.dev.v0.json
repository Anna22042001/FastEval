On any frequency where the signal's sidebands are within the channel\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules for 60 meter operation require that a Morse code (CW) signal can be placed on any frequency where the signal's sidebands are within the 60-meter band, which is from 5351.5 to 5366.5 kHz. This means the carrier frequency of the CW signal can be set at any frequency within this band, as long as the signal's sidebands are completely contained within the band. D is the correct answer.\n\nDetailed calculations of the bandwidth of a CW signal can be complex, but the FCC allows amateur radio operators to use the following rules of thumb to determine if a CW signal is within the 60-meter band:\n\nThe upper sideband must be between 5358 and 5366 kHz\nThe lower sideband must be between 5351.5 and 5358 kHz\nThe total bandwidth of the signal must not exceed 3 kHz\nIt's important to note that these rules are only for Morse code (CW) signals on the 60-meter band.
