For example, in a 2:1 fixed ratio schedule, two responses are required for each reinforcement. Once the fixed number of responses has been made, the reinforcement is delivered, and the count for the next reinforcement begins anew.\n\nVariable ratio schedules, on the other hand, do not specify a fixed number of responses needed for reinforcement. Instead, the number of responses required varies within a certain range. For example, in a variable ratio 4:1 schedule, the first reinforcement may be given after four responses, the next after three responses, the next after five responses, and so on.\n\nOne reason why a researcher might use a variable ratio of reinforcement is that it is more resistant to extinction than a fixed ratio schedules. Extinction occurs when a reinforcement is no longer delivered after a response is made, and the response eventually diminishes or disappears. In a fixed ratio schedule, once the fixed number of responses has been made and the reinforcement is delivered, the rate of responding typically decreases rapidly. However, in a variable ratio schedule, there is no predetermined number of responses, so the rate of responding tends to remain high for a longer period of time, even without reinforcement.\n\nTherefore, variable ratio schedules can be more effective in maintaining responding behaviors, which makes them particularly useful in situations where a consistent response is needed, such as in behavioral therapy or in training animals\n\nThere are some drawbacks to using variable ratio schedules", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhy might a researcher use a variable ratio of reinforcement rather than a fixed ratio?\nA) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\nB) Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcements are more time intensive.\nC) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements produce results more quickly.\nD) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 19:23:22.061464+00:00"}
