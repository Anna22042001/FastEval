The unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of crossing changes required to turn the knot into the unknot, which is a simple circle.\n\nIn this case, the knot with DT code 6, 10, 22, 24, 16, 18, 20, 4, 2, 14, 12, 8 can be unknotted by changing two crossings. One crossing can be changed at position 12 in the code, and another crossing can be changed at position 10. This results in a simple circle, and thus the unknotting number of the knot is 2.\n\nHere is an example of the crossing changes:\n```\nThe original knot with DT code 6, 10, 22, 24, 16, 18, 20, 4, 2, 14, 12, 8:\n\n    (      (      (      (         (         (         (          (\n          1    2  |   5    6  | 10    11  | 15    16  | 18    19  |\n          3    4  |  --   7  | --   8  |  --    12  |  --    13  | \n         ------    ------    ------    ------\n           12  <-> 13\n\n         (          (          (          (\n            1    2  | 3    4", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine the unknotting number of the knot, represented in Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
