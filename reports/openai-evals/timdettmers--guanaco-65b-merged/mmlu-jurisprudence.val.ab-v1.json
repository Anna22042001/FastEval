This approach seeks to uncover how structures that appear fair or impartial actually perpetuate inequality. For example, asking the women question about workplace dress codes might reveal that rules on attire disproportionately impact women by reinforcing gender stereotypes, restricting their self-expression, or creating unequal standards for evaluating performance. The goal of asking the women question is to identify and challenge systems of oppression that are entrenched in society, with the aim of achieving gender equality and justice.\n\nSources:\n\nMary Kincheloe, \"The 'Woman Question' and the Politics of Sexuality in the Origins of Feminism,\" in _The Making of Feminist Politics: Women's Movements, Institutions, and Political Change_ (Princeton University Press, 1989).\n\n\"Asking the Women's Question: A Guide to Gender Analysis Frameworks\" [PDF], United Nations Development Programme, 2011.\n\n\"Asking the Women Question,\" _Victoria University of Wellington_, https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sociology/research/discipline-research/asking-womens-question.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhat is meant by 'asking the women question'?\nA) Seeking answers from women about their experience of discrimination.\nB) Enquiring of men why they oppress women.\nC) Encouraging women to be more assertive.\nD) Attempting to expose the gender consequence of rules and practices that may seem to be objective or neutral.", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 19:53:35.868780+00:00"}
