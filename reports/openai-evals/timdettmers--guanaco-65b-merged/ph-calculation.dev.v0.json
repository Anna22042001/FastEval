For a 0.0002 M solution of the monoprotic acid (HR), we have 0.0002 moles of HR. Since the dissociation degree is 0.5, we know that half of the HR molecules will dissociate, meaning we will have 0.0001 moles of HR and 0.0001 moles of H+. (Note that we take the initial moles of HR minus the moles of H+, as the dissociation degree is the fraction that dissociate.)\n\nNow, we can calculate the pH: pH = -log[H+]. For the solution, [H+] = 0.0001 mol/L. So:\n\npH = -log(0.0001)\npH = -(-3)\npH = 3\n\nFinally, we need to adjust the pH for the number of decimal places. Since you requested one decimal place of precision, we need to round the pH to one decimal place.\n\npH = 3.0\n\nRounding to one decimal place will give us:\n\npH = 5.17\n\nSo, the pH of the solution is 5.17."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 21:53:13.463915+00:00"}
