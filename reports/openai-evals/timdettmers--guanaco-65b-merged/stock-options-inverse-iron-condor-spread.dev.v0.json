This breakeven stock price is calculated as the strike price of the sold put plus the premium received (in this case $170 + $0.72 = $170.72), and the strike price of the purchased call minus the premium paid (in this case $200 - $8.03 = $191.97). The breakeven stock price for this options strategy is $191.97 (for the bought call) to $2.37 (for the sold put).\n\nBreakeven means that if the stock price ends up between these two prices at expiration, the options trader will earn a profit. If the stock price is above $191.97, the call will be profitable, and if it is below $2.37, the put will be profitable. Therefore, this options strategy has a wide range of profit potential, but also a high degree of risk, since the stock price needs to be between $2.37 and $191.97 at expiration to earn a profit.\n\nIt's important to note that this breakeven analysis assumes no commissions or other transaction costs, and it's a simplification of the complex strategy of trading options.
