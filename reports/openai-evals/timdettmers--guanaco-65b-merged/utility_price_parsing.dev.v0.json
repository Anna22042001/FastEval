The bill shows that the customer used 423 kWh of electricity.\n\n2. The supply charge is $68.21, which includes the cost for the electricity itself as well as any other supply-related charges.\n\n3. To calculate the cost per kWh for supply, we need to divide the total supply charge ($68.21) by the number of kWh used (423):\n\n$68.21 / 423 kWh = $0.162 per kWh.\n\n4. For delivery, the bill shows that the customer was charged $17.43 for 423 kWh, which gives a delivery cost of $0.041 per kWh:\n\n$17.43 / 423 kWh = $0.041 per kWh.\n\n5.
