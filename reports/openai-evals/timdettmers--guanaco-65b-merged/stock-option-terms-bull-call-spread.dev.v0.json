The maximum profit for this strategy is the difference between the strike prices of the two options minus the initial cost of the transaction. The maximum loss is the initial cost of the transaction.\n\nIn this specific case, the investor has sold a $340 strike price call for $0.09 and bought a $245 strike price call for $34.78.
