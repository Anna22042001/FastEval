Short Put Butterfly Spread: This strategy involves selling two options at a lower strike price, buying two options at a middle strike price, and selling two options at a higher strike price.

In this case, the investor has sold one put option with a strike price of $240, bought one put option with a strike price of $235, and sold another put option with a strike price of $255.
