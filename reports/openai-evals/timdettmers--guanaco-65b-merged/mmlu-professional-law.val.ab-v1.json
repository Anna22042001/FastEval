Situated along the north shore of this island were coral reefs which are the home of a very rare species of fish that are found only along the north shore area. Congress conducted hearings to decide whether to authorize the construction of the naval base. During the hearings, one of the speakers who addressed the congressional committee was a famous expert on oceanography and marine biology. The expert vehemently opposed the naval plan and stated that the construction would, in his opinion, result in the extinction of the rare species of fish.

Since the contract was silent regarding remedies, the buyer should get the earnest money back. \nA contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties that outlines each party's obligations and rights. When a contract is breached, the non-breaching party may seek damages from the breaching party.\n\nHowever, not all breaches are created equally. If the defaulting party had no way of reasonably anticipating the circumstances that led to the breach, they may be able to avoid liability. In such cases, the court may find that the defaulting party was not in breach of contract. This is known as the doctrine of impossibility or the doctrine of frustration.\n\nIn this case, the buyer lost her job unexpectedly, which prevented her from purchasing the house. The buyer could not have reasonably anticipated this circumstance when she entered into the contract. As a result, the default is likely to be considered outside her control and not her fault. The buyer should be able to get their earnest money back.\n\nThe seller's actual damages may exceed the amount of the earnest money, but this is not relevant to the question of whether the buyer should get their money back. The seller can still sue the buyer for damages, but they will likely not be able to keep the earnest money. The contract was silent on remedies, so there is no contractual obligation for the buyer to forfeit the earnest money in the event of default.\n\nWhile the buyer may be liable for a breach of contract, the seller has a duty to mitigate their damages.

Just before the closing, the buyer lost her job. The buyer told the seller that she could no longer purchase the house and asked him to return the earnest money. The seller accurately told the buyer that the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money; that if the seller sued the buyer for damages, he would receive a minimum of $5,000; and that it would be difficult for him to sell the house in the current market. Should the buyer get the earnest money back? \nA) No, because the contract was silent regarding remedies.\nB) Yes, because the buyer is no longer ready, willing, and able to purchase the house.\nC) Yes, because the reason for the buyer's default was not anticipated.\nD) No, because the seller's actual losses exceeded the amount of the earnest money.", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 20:45:46.704555+00:00"}
