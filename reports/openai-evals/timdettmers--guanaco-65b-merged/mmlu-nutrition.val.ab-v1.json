Body weight is the most frequently used anthropometric measure to estimate body mass.

Muscles store ATP in small amounts, but this stored ATP can only provide enough energy for a few seconds of contraction. To sustain muscle contraction for longer periods, muscles need to produce more ATP.\n\nThis is where a process called aerobic respiration comes in. Aerobic respiration is a series of chemical reactions that convert glucose and oxygen into ATP and water. The glucose provides the energy needed to produce ATP, while the oxygen is used to convert the glucose into water and carbon dioxide.\n\nDuring aerobic respiration, glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. These pyruvate molecules are then converted into ATP and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). The NADH molecules are then used to generate more ATP through a process called oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nDuring oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons from NADH are transferred to another molecule called FAD, which then passes the electrons to the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is a series of proteins that are embedded in the membrane of the mitochondria, the small structures that produce ATP in cells. As the electrons move along the chain, they generate a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane.\n\nThis proton gradient is used to generate ATP through a process called chemiosmosis.
