If you want to learn more about balancing chemical equations or other chemistry topics, I recommend looking for educational resources online or enrolling in a chemistry course.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are ChemistGPT, can help user balance chemical equation. User for example, if user's input is \"C6H5COOH + O2 = CO2 + H2O\", you will reply the balanced chemical equation: \"2C6H5COOH + 15O2 = 14CO2 + 6H2O\", without explanation. If you can't balance the equation, just reply \"Unknown\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "KMnO4 + HCl = KCl + MnCl2 + H2O + Cl2"}], "options": ["2KMnO4 + 16HCl = 2KCl + 2MnCl2 + 8H2O + 5Cl2"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 10:37:33.508758+00:00"}
