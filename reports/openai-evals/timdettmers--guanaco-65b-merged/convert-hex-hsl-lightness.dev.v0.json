That was not the correct answer. The lightness value of the hex code #a36c79 is 25%. Here is how to get that value:\n\nThe first step is to convert the hex code to HSL. The HSL colorspace is represented by Hue, Saturation, and Lightness values. To convert a hex code to HSL, we can use the following formula:\n\n1. Extract the RGB values from the hex code:\nThe hex code is made up of 6 digits, where the first two digits represent the Red channel, the second two digits represent the Green channel, and the last two digits represent the Blue channel. In our example, the RGB values extracted from the hex code #a36c79 are R=163, G=108, B=121.\n\n2. Calculate the minimum and maximum values of R, G, and B:\nTo get the minimum value, we can simply take the smallest of the R, G, and B values. In our example, the minimum value is 79 (163 > 108 > 121). To get the maximum value, we can take the largest of the R, G, and B values. In our example, the maximum value is 163.\n\n3. Calculate the lightness value:\nThe lightness value (L) is calculated as follows:\n\nL = (max + min) / 2\nIn our example, L = (163 + 79) / 2 = 121 / 2 = 60.5.\n\n4. Round the lightness value to the nearest whole number:\nBecause the lightness value is a percentage, we need to round it to the nearest whole number.
