The other options are not aligned with Sumner’s ideas or contradict them directly.\n\nWhy is this important?\nThis question is helpful in understanding the economic philosophies of the late 1800s and how they have evolved over time. The laissez-faire approach dominated economic thinking in the U.S. during the Gilded Age but has since been criticized for its failure to address social problems like poverty and inequality.
