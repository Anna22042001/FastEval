In a case-control study, the investigator could identify women who have had a child with a neural tube defect (the cases) and compare them to women who have had a child without a neural tube defect (the controls)1. The investigator could then look back at the medical histories of the two groups to see if there is a difference in acetaminophen use during the first trimester1. A case-control study is particularly useful in situations where the outcome of interest is rare (like neural tube defects), since it allows the investigator to study a large number of cases without having to follow a very large population over time1.\n\nA cohort study would also be a good option, but it would likely be more difficult to implement1.
