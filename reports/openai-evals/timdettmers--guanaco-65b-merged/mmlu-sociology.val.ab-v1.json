Scientific management is a theory of management that seeks to optimize productivity through methods such as motivating employees with rewards, measuring and specifying work tasks, and subdividing labour into small tasks. The theory was developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century and is based on the idea that scientific methods can be applied to the management of workers. \n\nTaylor believed that by studying and optimizing the work process, managers could determine the most efficient way of doing each job, and then train workers to do the job in this way. This would result in higher productivity, lower costs, and greater profits for the company.\n\nTaylor's approach involved breaking down jobs into small, standardized tasks that could be performed in a specific sequence. He also encouraged the use of time and motion studies to determine the most efficient way of performing each task. The results of these studies would then be used to establish standard methods of performing each task.\n\nTo motivate workers to follow the standard methods, Taylor believed that managers should offer performance-based incentives, such as bonuses or pay increases. This would give workers a direct incentive to be more productive and efficient.\n\nIn summary, scientific management involved all of the techniques mentioned in the question, including the measurement and specification of work tasks, the subdivision of labour, and the provision of rewards and incentives for productivity. However, the primary focus of the theory was on using scientific methods to optimize the work process, which is why answer A is the correct response.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nScientific management involved:\nA) motivation and rewards for productivity\nB) the measurement and specification of work tasks\nC) all of the above\nD) the subdivision of labour into small tasks", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 21:08:12.309750+00:00"}
