This suggests that eating too much sugar may form a vicious circle, that is, eating sugar regularly will lead to a decrease in the sensitivity of taste buds to sweetness, and a decrease in satisfaction caused by eating the same amount of sugar, which will subconsciously ask for more sugar. The result is that eating too much sugar leads to obesity.Question: Which of the following options does not support the above argument?\nA.
