The experiment was conducted in a factory setting, where three different styles of leadership were tested: an authoritarian style, a democratic style, and a laissez-faire style. Authoritarian leadership involves a high degree of control and supervision, while democratic leadership involves shared decision-making and employee participation. Laissez-faire leadership, on the other hand, is characterized by a hands-off approach, with minimal supervision and direction from the leader.\n\nThe results of the experiment showed that the democratic leadership style was the most effective in terms of increasing employee productivity. The democratic group showed the highest level of task performance, while the authoritarian group performed the worst. The laissez-faire group also performed worse than the democratic group, suggesting that a certain level of leadership structure is necessary for optimal performance.\n\n## External links\n\n*  Quotations related to Kurt Lewin at Wikiquote", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAccording to Lewin, Lippet and White's 1939 experiment, which form of leadership produced the most work from participants?\nA) A mix of laissez-faire and democratic\nB) Democratic\nC) Laissez-faire\nD) Authoritarian", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 20:01:43.564588+00:00"}
