One way this can occur is through reproductive isolation, where physical barriers or behavioral differences prevent individuals from different populations from interbreeding.\n\nIn the case of the fish populations, the gradual drop in the water level acted as a physical barrier that isolated the populations from one another. Over time, the isolated populations developed genetic differences due to mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift. These genetic differences can lead to the formation of reproductive barriers, such as differences in courtship behavior, gamete compatibility, or hybrid inviability, which prevent individuals from different populations from interbreeding.\n\nOne way to investigate these genetic differences is to compare the nucleotide sequences of gene alleles. Genes are segments of DNA that encode proteins or other functional molecules, and alleles are different versions of the same gene that arise due to mutations. By comparing the nucleotide sequences of gene alleles across the three fish species, we can identify specific genetic changes that have arisen since the populations became isolated.\n\nSo, answer C is the most likely correct response to the question.
