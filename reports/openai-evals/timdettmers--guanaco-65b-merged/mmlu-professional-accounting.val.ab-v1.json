The depreciation method used for financial accounting reporting should be used in capital budgeting decisions, rather than the method used for tax purposes. The reason is that financial accounting provides a more accurate picture of the company's financial position.\n\nB is incorrect. The impact of taxes on capital budgeting can significantly affect the decision to purchase new equipment. For example, the tax benefits of depreciation can increase the after-tax cash flows of the project, making it more attractive.\n\nC is incorrect. Evaluating anticipated after-tax cash flows over the depreciable life of the project can result in underestimating the true economic value of the project. This is because the depreciable life may be shorter than the useful life of the asset, and the project may still be generating benefits after the depreciation period ends.\n\nD is incorrect. Accelerated methods of depreciation do provide tax shields, but they may not be advantageous from a present-value point of view. Accelerated depreciation allows companies to deduct more tax in the early years of the project, but the total amount of tax deducted over the lifetime of the asset may be the same as with the straight-line method.\n\nFurthermore, the timing of cash flows may also impact the value of the project to the firm. The time value of money considers the interest rates at which a company can borrow or lend money, as well as the time between when money is spent and when it's received.
