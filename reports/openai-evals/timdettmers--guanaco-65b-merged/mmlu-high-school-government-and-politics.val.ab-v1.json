One of the unintended consequences of the law was the creation of thousands of political action committees (PACs), which were formed to raise and spend money on behalf of candidates. PACs can collect donations from individuals, unions, and corporations, and they've become a major source of funding for political campaigns. While PACs can be an effective way to support a cause or candidate, they can also create a negative perception of influence peddling and undue influence in politics.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 placed limits on how much individuals could donate to a federal election campaign (Answer A), the law did not drastically decrease the amount of money spent on television advertising (Answer D). In fact, television advertising has continued to be a significant component of political campaigns, and spending on political ads has increased in recent years.\n\nFinally, while federal funding did become available to presidential candidates who agreed to abide by spending limits (Answer B), this was not an unintended result of the law. Rather, it was one of the intentional goals of the law, aimed at reducing the influence of wealthy donors and creating a more level playing field for candidates.
