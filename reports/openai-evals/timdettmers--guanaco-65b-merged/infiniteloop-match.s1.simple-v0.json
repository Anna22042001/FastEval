An infinite loop is a loop in which the conditions for the loop to terminate are never met and the loop continues to run indefinitely.\n\n- Next, let's examine the loop structure of the function. The function contains a `do-while` loop that will continue to run as long as the `connected` variable is less than 0 and the count of attempts is less than `MAX_ATTEMPTS`. The `connected` variable is set to the return value of the `connect` function, which returns -1 on failure and a non-negative value on success.\n\n- Now, let's look at the code inside the loop. The loop attempts to establish a connection to the server using the `connect` function. If the connection is successful (the `connected` variable is greater than -1), the function reads and processes messages from the server.\n\n- Finally, we can make a determination about whether the loop will run forever or not. If the connection to the server cannot be established after `MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts, the `connected` variable will remain less than 0 and the loop will continue to run indefinitely. In this case, the function will run in an infinite loop. However, if the connection to the server is successful within `MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts, the loop will terminate and the function will stop. In this case, the function will not run in an infinite loop.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the function `processMessagesFromServer()` will run in an infinite loop if the connection to the server cannot be established after `MAX_ATTEMPTS` attempts.
