This is because in the worst case, the input data is already sorted and each comparison leads to a binary branch, resulting in a total of n log n comparisons.\n\nIn the worst case, the time complexity cannot be O(n) or O(n^2) because the number of comparisons is less than or more than n log n, respectively.\n\nIn the worst case, the time complexity cannot be O(log n) because the number of comparisons is greater than log n.\n\nIt is important to note that this is the worst case time complexity, and the actual time complexity can be different depending on the input data and implementation.
