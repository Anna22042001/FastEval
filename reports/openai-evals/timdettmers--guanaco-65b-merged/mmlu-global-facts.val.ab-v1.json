I can give you some general information on the topic, but not a precise answer.\n\nAfter the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, the United States did provide aid to Japan as part of the post-war reconstruction efforts. The goal was to help Japan recover and become a democratic nation that could participate in the international community.\n\nThis aid was not without controversy, as many Americans were critical of helping a country that had been the enemy during the war. There were concerns about the cost of the aid and whether it should come at the expense of American needs, such as food shortages.\n\nIt's important to note that public opinion on this issue was complex and varied over time. Immediately after the war, public sentiment was largely positive toward the idea of providing aid to Japan. However, as the reconstruction effort went on and as the Cold War began, public opinion shifted and support for the aid declined.\n\nIn general, it's important to keep in mind that public opinion on complex issues like this can be difficult to measure and varies depending on a number of factors, such as the time period, the specific question asked, and the sample of the population being surveyed.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAfter the Atom bomb how many Americans support giving aid to Japan even at the cost of food shortages?\nA) 85%\nB) 50%\nC) 66%\nD) 33%", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-15 17:54:36.998774+00:00"}

However, there have been efforts to address these issues in recent years, with some progress being made in increasing enrollment rates.\n\nIn 2017, UIS, the global UN agency for education, reported that 61.5 percent of children worldwide had access to education. It meant that the percentage of out-of-school children fell from 17.3 percent in 2003 to 16.7 percent.
