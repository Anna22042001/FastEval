To answer the question, you need to apply your understanding of molecular motion, energy, and temperature concepts to the given scenario.\n\nThe key idea to note is that when heat is added to a closed system, the energy will be distributed among the molecules in the system, causing an increase in their temperature and kinetic energy. This means that the molecules will move faster, resulting in higher speeds and higher kinetic energies.\n\nLet's look at the possible answers given:\n\n* **Answer A:** It's not correct to say that it's not possible to determine the average velocity and kinetic energy of the molecules. In fact, these quantities can be calculated based on the molecular mass and temperature.\n* **Answer B:** It's unlikely that the molecules of one gas would end up with a different average speed and the same average kinetic energy, especially when both gases are in the same container.\n* **Answer C:** This is a more likely scenario, as the molecules of both gases should end up with similar speeds and kinetic energies, since they are in the same container and exposed to the same temperature change.\n* **Answer D:** While it's possible that the molecules of hydrogen could speed up more than the molecules of carbon dioxide, it's unlikely that they would end up with a higher average kinetic energy. Both gases should have the same average kinetic energy, since they have the same temperature.\n\nThe right answer appears to be C.
