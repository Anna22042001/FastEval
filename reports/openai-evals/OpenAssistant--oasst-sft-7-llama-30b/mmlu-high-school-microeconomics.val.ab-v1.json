However, there are other factors that can influence how much more (or less) people consume when prices change, such as changes in income levels, availability of substitutes, etc.\n\nThe concept of \"price elasticity of demand\" measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price, while holding all else constant. When the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price, we say that the demand for the product is elastic. Conversely, if the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than the percentage change in price, then the demand is considered inelastic.\n\nIn this case, since the total revenue increased by 30% despite reducing the price by only 15%, it means that the new price has led to an even larger increase in demand.
