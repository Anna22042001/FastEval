An increase in price would result from the decreased output, as consumers would have to pay more for a lower supply of the good.\n\nOption A can be eliminated as the equilibrium price and output are determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves, and regulation by nature is designed to alter these curves, potentially shifting the equilibrium to a point with a lower price and/or lower output.\n\nOption B is not possible within a competitive market, where an output increase would drive down the price, unless demand for the product is highly inelastic, which is unlikely given that goods and services that pollute the environment tend to have elastic demand as the negative externalities are borne more by society rather than just the producers and consumers.\n\nOption C is not possible as a decrease in output due to regulation would shift the supply curve to the left, which would lead to a higher equilibrium price due to the lower quantity supplied.\n\nOption D reflects the outcome of externality regulation on the market equilibrium, where the price is driven up but the output is driven down, as the costs of the negative externality are accounted for, reflecting a more accurate valuation of the product.
