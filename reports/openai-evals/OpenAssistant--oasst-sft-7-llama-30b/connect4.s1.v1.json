This ideology is based on the belief that women are naturally less capable than men and that their primary role in society is to support men in their efforts and endeavors. This is often rooted in the notion that women are not as physically strong as men and that they are more emotionally sensitive.\n\nThe belief in a patriarchal system has a long history and can be traced to religious, cultural and social constructs of gender roles. It typically takes the form of a hierarchical system where men hold positions of power and women are expected to obey and serve men. This can manifest in various aspects of society such as politics, religion, education and the family structure.\n\nIt is a widely held view that this belief in patriarchy is wrong and damaging because it assumes that women are only important as long as they support men, rather than recognizing they have their own inherent worth and capabilities. Critics argue that this view of women is one sided, ignoring the myriad ways in which women contribute to society, from providing the emotional support that men need to taking care of the home and children. Also, many believe that this system is not fair to men as well, as they are also affected by it.\n\nIn terms of consequences of the belief in patriarchy, it can result in discrimination against women, preventing them from accessing certain opportunities or facing greater barriers to achieving their goals. It can also lead to a culture where women are treated as second-class citizens, and there are often greater expectations placed on women than men.\n\nAs you can see, the belief in patriarchy is a deeply embedded cultural norms and values that has been practiced for centuries, and it is still deeply rooted in many societies today.
