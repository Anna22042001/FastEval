However, I can provide a general overview of some points that may help you better understand this concept.\n\nWeber argued that all knowledge is value-relevant because it is inevitably shaped by the values and interests of those who produced it. He believed that knowledge is intertwined with power, and that the interests and values of those in positions of power shape the way knowledge is produced and disseminated. Therefore, all knowledge is value-relevant because it reflects the values and interests of those who created it, whether they are aware of it or not.\n\nAgain, this is a very simplified answer, and the concept of value-relevant knowledge is complex and nuanced.
