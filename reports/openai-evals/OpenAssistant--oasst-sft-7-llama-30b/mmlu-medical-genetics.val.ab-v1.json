The expression of the genes in the lac operon is regulated by a lacI-encoded repressor protein, which can bind to the operator region of the lac operon, inhibiting the transcription of the lac genes.\n\nWhen the level of glucose is low, the lac operon is activated, leading to the transcription of the lac genes. However, when the level of glucose is high, the lac operon is inhibited by the binding of the lacI-encoded repressor protein to the operator.\n\nIf there is a mutation in the lacI gene, causing the repressor protein to not bind to the operator, it should result in the constitutive expression of the lac operon genes.
