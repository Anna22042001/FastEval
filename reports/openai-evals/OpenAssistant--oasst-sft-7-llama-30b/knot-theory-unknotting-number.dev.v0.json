The unknotting number is an important invariant, however, and has been the subject of much research in knot theory. In particular, it has been conjectured that the unknotting number of a knot is always a power of an integer, although this result has not yet been proven.\n\nThe Dowker-Thistlethwaite code is a standard notation for describing a knot, and can be used to specify the unknotting number of a knot. The unknotting number of a knot is equal to the number of crossings in the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, minus the number of \"down\" crossings. Therefore, to determine the unknotting number of the knot represented by a Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, you would need to count the number of crossings in the code and identify the \"down\" crossings, which are those crossings that correspond to the undercrossing strand in the knot diagram.\n\nFor the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code provided, the crossing information would need to be determined in this way, and from that the number of \"down\" crossings can be calculated.
