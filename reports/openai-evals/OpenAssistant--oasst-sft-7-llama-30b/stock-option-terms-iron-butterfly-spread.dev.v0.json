This is a non-directional options strategy that seeks to profit from a narrowing of the price difference between the strike prices of the options involved.

The goal is to profit from the difference in price between the two options if the stock price stays within the range of the strike prices. In this case, the investor sells a put option with a strike price of $104 at a price of $3.6, while buying a put option with a strike price of $98 at a price of $1. This provides a credit, which can help to limit the risk. The investor also sells a call option with a strike price of $104 at a price of $1.51 and buys a call option with a strike price of $109 at a price of $0.6.
