However, one way to approach this problem would be to use a computer program that can calculate the ranking of poker hands based on the cards provided. There are several such software solutions available online that can help calculate the rank of a poker hand. These programs can take the cards provided as input and return the highest ranking hand.</s> \nHow accurate are these programs in predicting the highest ranking hand?</s> \nThese programs are very accurate in predicting the highest ranking hand as they are designed based on the standard rules of poker. However, it is always possible for the programs to make mistakes if the input data is incorrect or incomplete. It is always a good practice to double-check the rankings returned by the program to ensure that they are accurate and complete.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "TASK: Two sets of playing cards will be provided.
