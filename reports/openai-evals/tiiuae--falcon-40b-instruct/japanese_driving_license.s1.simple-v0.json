Applicants are tested on their knowledge of traffic laws and regulations, safe driving practices, and vehicle handling skills. The purpose of the exam is to ensure that individuals who obtain a license are capable of operating motor vehicles safely and responsibly on public roads. \n\nBefore taking the exam, candidates are expected to have a basic understanding of the rules and regulations of the road, including traffic signals, signs, and road markings. They should also know how to handle common situations such as merging lanes or navigating intersections. Additionally, they should be proficient in basic vehicle maintenance tasks such as checking fluid levels and tire pressure. \n\nMany candidates also choose to enroll in driving schools or take practice tests to better prepare for the exam. These resources can help address any knowledge gaps or develop necessary skills before taking the test. \n\nOverall, the driving license exam serves as an important gatekeeper for individuals who wish to operate vehicles on the road in Japan. By passing the exam, candidates demonstrate their ability to operate motor vehicles safely and responsibly, which helps protect both themselves and the public at large.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a examinee taking driving license exam in Japan.
