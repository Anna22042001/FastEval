Binding to MHC-I molecules on the surface of infected cells and recognizing virus-derived peptides presented by those MHC-I molecules. This binding activates cytotoxic T cells and initiates the killing process.\n\n3. Recognizing damaged or apoptotic cells that have been infected with the virus and carrying out their elimination.\n\n4. Enhancing the uptake of antigenic molecules by dendritic cells and macrophages to stimulate the antigen-presenting process and activate helper T cells to amplify the immune response.\n\nOverall, cytotoxic T cells play a critical role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response to viral infections, providing an effective defense mechanism against the virus.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nCytotoxic T cells can be activated via which of the following?\nA) By releasing complement\nB) By reacting with budding viruses\nC) By identifying virus peptides presented by antibodies\nD) By identifying virus peptides presented by MHC-I", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-14 09:34:12.099355+00:00"}
