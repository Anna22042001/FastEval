Set up a dictionary with the letters of the chromosomes as the keys and their positions as the values. For example: \nd = {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2, 'd': 3, 'e': 4, 'f': 5, 'g': 6, 'h': 7, 'i': 8, 'j': 9, 'k': 10, 'l': 11,'m': 12, 'n': 13, 'o': 14, 'p': 15, 'q': 16, 'r': 17,'s': 18, 't': 19, 'u': 20, 'v': 21, 'w': 22, 'x': 23, 'y': 24, 'z': 25}\n\n2. Convert all genotypes into lowercase and split them by space.\n\n3. Split each genotype by space again and store the alleles in a list.\n\n4. Convert each allele into lowercase and store its letter in a list.\n\n5. Use the dictionary to find the position of each letter in the list by multiplying its position in the alphabet by its position in the genotype.\n\n6. Find the median of the positions of the letters in the genotype by sorting the positions of the letters in the list and selecting the median element.\n\n7. Output the median allele in lowercase.\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```\nwith open('genotypes.txt', 'r') as f:\n    content = f.readlines()\n\ndata =", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Given the result of a three-point test cross with each line of input containing a genotype and the corresponding number of offspring, find the allele in the middle.
