By definition, an integral domain is a commutative ring such that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. If a ring has a field of quotients, that means it can be embedded into some other ring, and since it must have a multiplicative inverse, the other ring must also have a multiplicative inverse. Given that an integral domain has a field of quotients, we can then embed it into itself, since one of the properties of integral domains is that they are rings. Since rings are sets closed under addition and multiplication, we can create a new ring from the existing ring. This new ring is called a field, since we can perform operations in it using fractions. Therefore, statement 1 is true.</s> \nHow does the concept of a \"field of quotients\" relate to the property of an integral domain having a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element?</s> \nThe concept of a \"field of quotients\" is directly related to the property of an integral domain having a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element. In particular, let R be an integral domain such that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Then, the set of fractional ideals generated by the nonzero elements of R is a field of quotients. This follows from the fact that any nonzero ideal I of an integral domain D is invertible if and only if I is a field, since D is an integral domain and every ideal is principal. If D is a field and I is a fractional ideal, then I is a field extension of D. Conversely, if a fractional ideal J of a field extension E is given, then E is a subfield of J, and J is an integral domain over E, so E is an extension of J. Therefore, J is a field.

The maximum possible order of an element is the largest size of the permutation that it can create.\n\nTo calculate the maximum possible order for an element of S_7, we need to consider the possible sizes of all permutations generated by this element. In S_7, there are six disjoint cycles of orders 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, which are generated by the element s_1 (represented as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in cycle notation). We can use Pascal's Triangle to compute the maximum order of each cycle, by multiplying the number of elements in the cycle by i. The maximum possible order of cycle 7 is 7!/i!, where i is the number of elements in the cycle. By applying this to the other cycles and adding up the results, we can compute the maximum possible order of the permutation generated by this element.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order of an element of S_7 is 7! = 5040.
