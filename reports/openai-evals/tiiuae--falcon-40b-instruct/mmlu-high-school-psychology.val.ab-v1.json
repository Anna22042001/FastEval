The sucking reflex helps the baby secure a nipple in the mouth for breastfeeding, while rooting helps to find the nipple. The Moro reflex occurs when an infant is startled or alarmed and spreads his or her arms out wide, followed by a pulling motion. Attachment is an emotional bonding between the infant and caregiver or parents, and it develops gradually as the caregiver shows affection, warmth, and consistent care for the baby.</s> \nHow does the rooting reflex help the newborn develop cognitive and sensory abilities?</s> \nThe rooting reflex is an important tool for the newborn's developing cognitive and sensory abilities. By guiding the baby's head towards the stimulus, the reflex helps the baby explore their environment and gather information about it. This information is essential for developing cognitive and sensory abilities, as the baby learns about their surroundings and begins to understand the world around them.
