Taking the negative logarithm of both sides of the equation results in the desired pH value. The equation can be modified to solve for pKa using the following steps:\n\n1. Convert the hydrogen ion concentration from moles/liter to moles/m^3\n2. Calculate the total amount of acid in moles\n3. Convert the total amount of acid to moles/m^3\n4. Calculate the total amount of base in moles\n5. Convert the base to moles/m^3\n\nOnce the total amounts of acid and base are converted to moles per cubic meter, the base can be substituted for acid in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
