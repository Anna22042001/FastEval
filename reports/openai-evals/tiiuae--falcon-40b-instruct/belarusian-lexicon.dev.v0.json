Please enter a word that is present in the language model's data.</s> \nWhat steps can the developer take to improve the machine learning on the language model, so that it can recognize words in Belarusian language better?</s> \nAs an AI language model, I don't have firsthand experience in using the Belarusian language. But generally speaking, here are some suggestions that can improve text classification for machine learning:\n\n1. Train & fine-tune your model. One approach to improve a language model's accuracy is to train it on large amounts of text data that cover a wide range of topics and subjects. For instance, instead of relying on a specific dictionary or set of terms, try using a more robust collection of texts, such as a corpus, that includes a variety of sources, genres, and styles (e.g., news articles, books, social media posts, etc.). Then, periodically fine-tune your model to re-train it and increase its accuracy, ideally using both supervised and unsupervised techniques.\n\n2. Use feature engineering. Text classification tasks often involve analyzing sequences of words or characters and understanding how they interact with each other to convey meaning. This process is known as feature engineering, and it's essential since text data can be very high-dimensional. Feature engineering involves identifying relevant features from the text that can help identify the language and content of the texts. For instance, the presence of specific terms, phrases, and grammatical structures in a text can be important indicators of its language, domain, and content. You can extract these features from the text using techniques such as regular expressions or named entities recognition. Try experimenting with different features to understand what works best.\n\n3. Use pre-trained language models. Language models are typically constructed using neural networks, which learn to understand text by processing large quantities of it", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You will be prompted with a single word.
