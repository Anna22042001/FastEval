During muscle contraction, ATP is broken down into ADP. This results in a decrease in the amount of ATP in the muscle cells, which ultimately leads to a reduction in muscle force. To maintain muscle contraction, ADP must be continuously regenerated into ATP. This process is referred to as the ATP-PC (phosphocreatine) system. The creatine in our muscles helps to resynthesize ATP from ADP.
