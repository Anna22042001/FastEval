Her office has failed to pay tens of thousands of taxpayers due their tax refunds. She has not reported her employees timecards and cannot account for missing money that she has collected from taxpayers.\nUnder the law of California, county clerks are responsible for ensuring that taxpayer refunds are paid as soon as possible.\nWhile hundreds of millions of dollars are missing from Ferguson’s office, Ferguson refuses to report on how much money her office needs to pay employees for their work, in addition to keeping the office running 24 hours a day to serve taxpayers.\nFerguson’s office has received thousands of complaints that taxpayers are not receiving timely refunds, and has only responded a tiny fraction of the time on all taxpayer documents.\n“For a clerk to fail to pay employees their hard earned tax reimbursements is a dereliction of duty and a failing of fiduciary responsibility. Nancy Ferguson’s office has routinely violated the law that requires her office to pay employees on a timely basis, and the Bay Area has lost all faith and trust in her office,” said Secretary of State Debra Bowen.\nIn response to Bowen’s call for the immediate recall of Nancy Ferguson, Ferguson issued a statement. “While this matter does involve missing information about money related to the County's accounting system, my efforts to bring in all funds, pay employee salaries, and perform the other duties associated with the Office are consistent with my statutory and constitutional duty. I have been doing my job to ensure that the County is functioning and fulfilling important duties to its constituents.\n“While I am unable to comment on the recall petition filed today, in the past I have always been happy to address all complaints that have been made to the County -- and that will continue,” she added", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.

These are some of the key symptoms that your air ducts may be time for maintenance:\n- Dirty condenser coils can cause your unit to leak refrigerant and reduce the amount of air your unit delivers to your home.\n- Dirty thermostats can reduce your home's overall efficiency, leading to high energy bills.\n- Air filters can become clogged with dirt and dust, leading to poor airflow and cooling.\nThe more dirt that is in your unit, the more it has to work to cool and dehumidify your home. If you are struggling to cool your home and experience air quality concerns, it is time to have your air ducts cleaned. Call us at (386) 257-3942 to get your AC serviced and cleaned right away.\nWhen your air conditioning unit has been sitting dormant for more time than it should, it can experience cooling problems. When this occurs, the refrigerant can escape the compressor, leading to problems with overall AC efficiency. In this scenario, it is best to have your air conditioning system repaired", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Imagine a 6 tall, 7 long connect4 board where 0 is empty spaces, X is a player and Y is another player.
