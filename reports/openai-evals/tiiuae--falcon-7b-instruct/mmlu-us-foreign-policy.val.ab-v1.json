It can also provide social and cultural influence over other nations, as well as the ability to encourage or discourage them from taking certain actions.\n\nBecause of this growing importance and the fact that many countries have been moving away from hard power for decades, we have seen an increasing attention and debate over the concept of soft power and how it can affect global politics.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhat is soft power?\nA) Use of coercive measures short of war, such as economic sanctions\nB) Ineffective use of one's power\nC) Ways in which the values and culture of a country provide it with influence in the international system\nD) When states use carrots (incentives) instead of sticks (threats) to influence other countries.", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-06-21 21:16:13.729701+00:00"}
