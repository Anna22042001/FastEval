The proposition (e.g., ¬A) will be true if one proposition is false or if one proposition is true and the other propositions are true. The propositions can be in any logical form, such as propositions made up of variables. To check the consistency of a set of propositions, we use the logical form of direct propositions by using parentheses to separate the propositions. Each proposition can be treated as either true or false. For example, A could either be true or false by itself. To generate each proposition from propositions using parentheses, consider three propositions. The first proposition is P, where P can be true or false depending on the proposition being used for a certain proposition. The second proposition is O, which is either true or false. The proposition that should be generated can be written as follows: P(O(A),P). If P is true, we can write P as true, O as false, and A as true, so O(P) is true. If P is false, we may have to check the propositions that are made by P in order for O(P) to be true. To get to the third proposition, we can use the parentheses to generate: O(A(P(L)),P(O(A)). As P(A) is true, we can rewrite: O((A |A^-))(L|L^-), true for O(B) and O(A^-),false for O(C), true for O(O^-), false for O(E), where P(A^-), O(B^-),A^- and O(E^-), A^-, O(N) or O, true respectively.
