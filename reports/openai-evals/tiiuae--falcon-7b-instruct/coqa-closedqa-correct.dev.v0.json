And maybe also witches. Bobby yelled. \n\n\"Yes! They can, too!\" Frank said, \"They're the most powerful and you can't stop me from flying!\" \n\n\"Well, if you fly, then I can fight with a sword, too. It's only fair,\" Bobby said back. \n\n\"No! They can't! They aren't even strong enough to pick up a sword. They can't even pick up a knife, they're so weak! I don't even know what you're talking about. You're crazy, aren't you?\" Frank pointed his finger at Bobby and ran at him with the sword made out of cardboard. \n\nBobby jumped out of the way as quickly as he could!

I'm going to tell mom.\" \n\n\"I can use any spell I want! I can use Freeze, Trap, and Fly! I can do any of them! I'm also telling mom that you think you can fly and you can't. You're a stupid knight with no brains. I have all the brains here.\" Bobby crossed his arms over his chest and stomped a foot on the ground. \n\n\"You take that back! I'm the smartest knight there is and I'll get you any day!\" Suddenly, Frank pulled Bobby to the ground. \"Take it back right now!\" \n\n\"BOYS!
