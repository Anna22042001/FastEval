In this case, the calculation is complicated because it consists of two costs that have to be deducted to get the expected total: The delivery fee and the electricity cost. This task can be approached as a series of calculations that involve the use of percentages. Let us begin by assuming that the DELIVERY SERVICES is 21.7%, which leaves 2% of the total cost. In that case, the following calculations apply: \nENERGY CHARGE = GENERATION CHARGE + DELIVERY SERVICES\nGENERATION CHARGE = (DELIVERY SERVICES * ENERGY CHARGE) / 100%\nDELIVERY SERVICES = GENERATION CHARGE\n$5.07 = DELIVERY SERVICES\n27.06 $ = GENERATION CHARGE\n$27.06 $ = DELIVERY SERVICES\nThus, the calculation can be represented as X% = (DELIVERY SERVICES + ENERGY CHARGE) / 100% X, where X = DELIVERY SERVICES. Given the provided information, it is not possible to determine ENERGY CHARGE. In that case, please provide more information in the response.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a JSON utility that must return machine-readable JSON as output."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your job is compute the cost per kWh of electricity supply (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) and the cost per kWh of electricity delivery (value must be a decimal rounded to 2 significant figures) based on the following incomplete OCR reading from a user's utility bill.
