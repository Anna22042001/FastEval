In your case, the chemical equilibrium represents a state where the rate of a forward reaction equals the rate of a reverse reaction.\n\n2. To balance the equation, we can either introduce a new reactant or a new product, depending on whether the chemical reaction is neutral, zero-sum or non-zero-sum.\n\n3. In this case, the neutral reaction shows that the amount of the reactants and products remain in balance. \n\n4. If a chemical reaction has a non-zero-sum equation, then there is change in the number of atoms of each element in the reactants compared to the product. \n\n5. In the case of CuSO4*5H2O, there are four s-octets (C) of reactants and two h-octets (H) of product.\n\n6. To balance the equation, the reactants should be equal to the product so that the number of atoms of each element is the same.\n\n7. In the case of CuSO4*5H2O, the equation can be balanced by adding a s-octet of H in the product. \n\n8. Thus, the balanced chemical equation in that case is: Cu + 2H2O = CuSO4. \n\n9. The s-octets are \"n=13\". Therefore, the balanced chemical equation should be expressed in a way that accounts for the difference in the number of s-octets. If the number exceeds four, that means there is a non-zero sum number in the left-hand side of the equation. \n\n10. For example, in the case of CuSO4*5H2O, the input is 2, which is an integer number, so there is a non-zero sum number.
