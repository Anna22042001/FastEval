To determine how many solid cubes with dimensions 0.8 m x 0.6 m x 1.1 m can fit in a box with dimensions 1.0 m x 1.9 m x 0.6 m, we need to calculate the volume of each cube and compare it to the available space in the box:\n\nVolume of one cube = length^3 + width^3 + height^3 = 0.8^3 + 0.6^3 + 1.1^3 = approximately 2.4 cu.m\n\nThe total volume of all the cubes will depend on how efficiently they can be packed into the box.

In general, if the question does not specify which aspect to consider it would be wise to assume they want both to be considered as little amount of space as possible for each dimension(ie: minimizing wasted space). Under this assumption I am going to state the result under both conditions. Firstly we will find how many cubes fit when considering the wastage of space in terms of volume, secondly we will find out how many cubes fit when considering the wastage of space in terms of surface area.\n\nVolume based approach: We need to fill the box with solid blocks while minimizing lost space due to volume. To do so, we need to arrange the blocks such that there are no gaps between them. If we place two rows of five blocks along the width of the container, leaving one block-size gap on either side, then stack these rows inside the box, we get the arrangement shown below:\n```lua\n       +---------------------+\n       |   .    .    .      |\n       +--------+----------+\n       |           ||          |\n   5    2   1        3       4\n       +--------+----------+\n       |   .    .    .      |\n       +--------------------+\n```\nHere, the first row has five blocks, and the second row has four blocks. This arrangement fits 28 cubes in the box because 5 rows of 4 blocks exist and there are 5 * 4 = 20 blocks in total. Each row has a height of 1.3m and a length of 0.7m, while each column has a length of 1.1m and a width of 0.6m. Therefore, 28 cubes fit in the box.

Since there will be no overlap on this dimension, we simply need to make sure that the small cubes don't extend beyond the large box's width dimension of 1.5m.
