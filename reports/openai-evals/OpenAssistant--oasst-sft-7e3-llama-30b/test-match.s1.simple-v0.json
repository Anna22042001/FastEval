Every night, she would sit by the fireplace in her cozy cottage and listen to her father's tales of adventure and bravery.\n\nOne day, the girl decided she wanted to go on her own adventure. She packed a bag with some food and a blanket, said goodbye to her father, and set off into the unknown. As she walked, she found herself in a dense forest with towering trees and hidden paths.
