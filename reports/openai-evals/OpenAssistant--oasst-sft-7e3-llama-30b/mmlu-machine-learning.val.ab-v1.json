As a result, the model tends to underfit the data, and its performance on new, unseen data (i.e., the test set) is worse than its performance on the training set. Increasing the amount of training data can help reduce the impact of estimation bias, but it cannot completely eliminate model bias. Therefore, as you increase the amount of training data, the training error may decrease, but the test error may stay high or even increase.\n\nHigh variance and high estimation bias can also contribute to this behavior, but they are less likely to be the main reason in this scenario. High variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training data, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance. High estimation bias occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, which can also lead to poor generalization performance. However, in this scenario, the train error is quite low, which suggests that overfitting is not the main issue. Therefore, model bias is the most probable reason for the observed behavior.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nYou observe the following while fitting a linear regression to the data: As you increase the amount of training data, the test error decreases and the training error increases.
