This is calculated by taking the sum of the net credit received ($1.89 + $1.85 - $2.63 - $2.61 = $0.93), divided by the number of shares purchased (100), multiplied by the appropriate factor to account for commissions and fees (in this case, 1 + commission/fee). The result is then subtracted from the total cost of the trade ($0.93 / (1 + commission/fee)) to determine the break even point. In this example, assuming a standard commission rate of $10 per transaction, the calculation would look like this:\n\nBreak Even Price = (Net Credit Received / Number of Shares Purchased) * (1 + Commission Fee)\n\nBreak Even Price = ($0.93 / 100) * (1 + (-$10/$150))\n\nBreak Even Price = $1.93 * (1 - 0.067)\n\nBreak Even Price = $1.93 * 0.933\n\nBreak Even Price = $1.80\n\nTherefore, if the stock price is below $147.61 at expiration, you will make a profit.
