The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the incidence rates of acute coronary syndrome in the two groups.\n\nTo calculate the relative risk, we first need to calculate the incidence rates of acute coronary syndrome in each group.

In this case, the incidence rate in the normal fibrinogen group is 20/60, and the incidence rate in the high fibrinogen group is 40/70.\n\nTo compare the incidence rates between the two groups, we need to divide the incidence rate in the high fibrinogen group by the incidence rate in the normal fibrinogen group. This gives us the relative risk:\n\nRR = incidence rate in high fibrinogen group / incidence rate in normal fibrinogen group\nRR = 40/70 / 20/60\nRR = (40*60)/(70*20)\nRR = (40*60)/(70*20*60)\nRR = 40/20\nRR = 2\n\nTherefore, the relative risk of acute coronary syndrome in patients with a high baseline plasma fibrinogen level compared to", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAn observational study in diabetics assesses the role of an increased plasma fibrinogen level on the risk of cardiac events. 130 diabetic patients are followed for 5 years to assess the development of acute coronary syndrome.
