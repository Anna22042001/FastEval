In this case, it appears to be a bear call spread since the short call has a higher strike price than the long call. This strategy involves selling one call option while simultaneously buying another call option with a lower strike price, which allows for more upside potential but also limits the downside risk. It is typically used when an investor expects the underlying asset's price to decrease in value over time and wants to profit from that movement without taking on too much risk. However, please note that there can be other factors involved in this trade such as implied volatility changes, market sentiment, etc., so further information would be needed to accurately classify the trade.", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a derivatives investor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Assume all contracts are for 100 shares.
