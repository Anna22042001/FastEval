While it is possible that RNA was abundant on early Earth, this alone would not suggest that it played any particular role in the emergence or development of life.\n* II, that RNA can self-replicate via a complementary chain, is one key property that could explain its potential significance. If RNA molecules were able to replicate themselves, they might be capable of reproducing copies of their genetic information, potentially leading to the rise of more complex organisms.\n* III, that RNA can catalyze some cellular functions, is another feature that could make RNA useful in the context of life's origin. Enzymes (also known as biological catalysts) speed up chemical reactions essential to living systems, so if RNA could act as an enzyme it might have contributed significantly to the workings of primitive cells. However, even if RNA did not serve as an enzyme itself, it could still play a role by interacting with other molecules that perform these vital tasks.\n\nFor these two reasons combined, we see that RNA likely had both self-replication properties and a capacity to help drive metabolic processes, making it a strong candidate for helping launch early life forms. Option B) I only and option D) II only are therefore incorrect because neither covers both aspects of RNA's relevance to life's origins.
