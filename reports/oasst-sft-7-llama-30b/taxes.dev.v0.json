However, assuming a single individual filing status and no other sources of income or deductions, we can estimate your federal income tax using the 2021 rates for Massachusetts and California.\n\nFirst, let's consider your residency state, California. According to the California Franchise Tax Board, the marginal tax rate for a single resident earning $50,000 per year in 2021 was approximately 7.6%. The taxable income would be calculated by subtracting any applicable exemptions or deductions from your gross income. If there are no such adjustments, then the taxable income before applying the CA rate would be $50,000 * (1 - Federal exemption) = $50,000 * 0.93 = $46,500. This means that your estimated state income tax would be around $46,500 * 0.076 = $3,456.\n\nNext, let's look at the federal portion. Since you will be living in Massachusetts during the summer, but receiving income earned while in California, you may owe both state and federal taxes on your entire income. Using the standard deduction ($12,750 for individuals), your federal taxable income could be $50,000 - $12,750 = $37,250. Applying the marginal federal tax rate of 12% for an annual income between $37,950 and $91,900, your expected federal tax bill would come out to around $4,540.\n\nTherefore, based on these calculations, your total tax burden might be roughly $3,", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Instructions: You will be presented with a tax calculation and four options A through D.
