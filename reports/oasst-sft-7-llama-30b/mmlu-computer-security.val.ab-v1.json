The hash function should have several properties:\n1) Deterministic: If you apply the same hash function to the same input, you will always get the same result. This means that if I send you the text \"Hello World\", your computer can reproduce my results by applying the same hash function.\n2) Fast: Your hash function should run quickly on whatever hardware it's running on. This allows for quick lookups. For example, when you search Google, they compute a hash of your query, then look up which page(s) match that hash.\n3) Uniform: Hash functions distribute their outputs evenly over all possible values. That way, if I have a million files each containing a different word from a dictionary, and I take their hashes modulo 5040 (to make them fit in the ASCII space), no one file will start with 'a', another with 'b', etc. Instead, every combination will occur roughly equally often.\n4) Collision resistant: If two inputs produce the same hash, this is called a collision. Good hash functions make collisions very unlikely—for any given pair of distinct inputs x and y, the chance that they collide (that is, that h(x)=h(y)) is close to zero. And if we know anything about either x or y, we cannot easily find a third input z such that h(z)=h(x).\n5) One Way: You cannot reverse the process and recover the original string from its hash.
