Therefore, if we have 0.001 moles of the acid, we will have 0.001 moles of H+ ions in the solution.\nNext, we take the negative logarithm base-10 of the hydrogen ion concentration, which gives us the pH value.

We know however that pure water is a dipolar compound, meaning that it's molecules consists of two atoms, therefore it's mass should actually be twice the one listed above, but I don't think you really need such precision. So, assuming the density of water at room temperature and pressure to be 10^9 J/kg or 1 g/ml :\nN_moles=n*(10^-9)/(10^9)=1/(10^18)=1/1e+18\nSo, for every cubic meter of solution, we would require approximately one millionth of a cubic centimeter of water,"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-16 23:29:39.075625+00:00"}

To calculate the pH of this acid solution, we need to use the formula:\n```\npH = -log(a)\n```\nWhere \"a\" is the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. In this case, since the acid is monoprotic and its dissociation degree is 0.5, the concentration of hydrogen ions will be equal to 0.0001 M. Therefore, we can plug that value into our equation to get:\n```\npH = -log(0.0001)\npH ≈ -3\n```\nSo the approximate pH of this acid solution would be around -3.
