D) Decreased leptin concentration in obesity results in increased insulin resistance and inflammation and is thought to lead to a number of diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary heart disease (CHD), and some types of cancer. E) Anything that increases muscle protein synthesis should be able to do so without affecting fat mass. F) Growth hormone does not act directly on skeletal muscle; rather it stimulates liver cells to produce insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). This binding to receptors on target cells causes an intracellular signal transduction cascade leading ultimately to activation of nuclear DNA replication and mitosis. Insulin-like growth factor I also binds to receptors in fibroblasts and other non-hepatic cell types, but there its action depends entirely upon indirect effects mediated by somatomedins produced by hepatocytes. H) The effect of increasing dosage of growth hormone above normal levels was tested using recombinant human growth hormone. Subjects were given recombinant hGH at two different daily dosages for several weeks: 0.15mg/kg per day or 0.375mg/kg per day.
