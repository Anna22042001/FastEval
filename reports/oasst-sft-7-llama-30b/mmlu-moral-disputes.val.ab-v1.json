He claims that humans have a unique ability to understand their own suffering, which gives them a \"superior ethical status\" over other animals. Accordingly, Norcross suggests that therapists may morally prioritize the interests of human clients over non-human animals. This viewpoint aligns with option (C). Option (A), therefore, is incorrect since there are two options provided, and none of these options support giving equal consideration to both human and animal suffering. Options (B) and (D) suggest different ways in which we can assign ethical value to human versus animal suffering, but they do not address whether one group has a higher ethical status than another.
