The variability in reinforcement creates uncertainty, which increases the strength and persistence of behaviors. This is because the animal or person does not know when they will receive the reward, so they continue performing the behavior in hopes of receiving it. In contrast, fixed ratio schedules become easily habituated and result in diminished responding over time. Therefore, variable ratios are commonly used for maintaining behavior over long periods of time, whereas fixed ratios are often used for initially establishing behavior.\n\nNote that while C) produces faster results initially, this effect decays rapidly over time as animals learn to \"game\" the system by simply stopping responding once they reach the required number of responses. Additionally, A) and B) do not accurately describe the differences between fixed and variable ratio schedules. Instead, these statements could be said about any schedule of reinforcement (e.g., fixed interval, variable interval). Therefore, while these may be true generally, they do not specifically address why one would choose a variable ratio schedule over a fixed ratio schedule.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhy might a researcher use a variable ratio of reinforcement rather than a fixed ratio?\nA) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements avoid problems such as generalization and the Premack principle.\nB) Fixed ratio schedules of reinforcements are more time intensive.\nC) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcements produce results more quickly.\nD) Variable ratio schedules of reinforcement are more resistant to extinction than fixed schedules.", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 18:09:56.412789+00:00"}
