The results showed that a democratic style of leadership was the most effective in producing high levels of output from the participant groups involved. This suggests that allowing individuals to have a say in decision making can be motivating and empowering, leading them to perform better in their roles.

Meanwhile, a purely hands-off laissez-faire approach might also lead to confusion or lack of direction among team members, potentially hindering performance as well. Thus, finding a balance between democratic involvement and clear expectations/guidance is key for leaders seeking to maximize output from their teams.

Therefore, the correct answers are: A), B) (as piece-work and job sharing aren't mentioned at all in your question), and not C) nor D).\n\nHere's some more information about these terms:\n\n* A) Telecommuting: This is when employees typically work from their homes instead of commuting into a central office. They may communicate with colleagues by phone, email, instant messaging, video conferencing, or another method. Some businesses encourage telecommuting as a way to boost productivity and employee morale while reducing costs associated with maintaining physical offices. However, it can also lead to feelings of isolation or difficulty separating work from personal life if not managed effectively.\n* B) Piece rate: This type of compensation pays employees based on the number of units they produce rather than the amount of time spent working. For example, a worker might receive a certain sum for each item produced within a given period. While piece rates can provide financial incentives for efficiency, there are concerns about exploitation and potential negative effects on quality control or team dynamics depending on how they are implemented.\n* C) Job sharing involves two people splitting the responsibilities and hours of what would normally be considered one full-time position. Both individuals might work reduced schedules and share benefits, though specific arrangements will vary based on company policies and labor agreements.

In contrast, a command structure, regulations and resistance to change are characteristics that are more commonly associated with bureaucratic organisations. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).\n\nHere's an explanation for each option:\n\n* A) Command structure refers to the hierarchical arrangement of positions within an organization, where orders flow down from higher-ranking officials to lower-ranking ones. Bureaucratic organizations typically have clear chains of command and well-defined roles and responsibilities for different levels of personnel. This helps to ensure efficiency and consistency in decision-making processes.\n* C) Change can be resisted by bureaucracies due to their focus on maintaining established procedures and rules. However, this does not mean that change cannot occur in such organizations. On the contrary, some forms of bureaucracy may actually promote change if it aligns with organizational goals or if new policies or technologies offer advantages over existing methods.\n* D) Regulations refer to official guidelines or principles that govern the behavior or actions of individuals within an organization. These can include standard operating procedures, administrative codes, or legal frameworks. Bureaucratic organizations often develop extensive sets of regulations to help manage complex operations, coordinate activities across multiple departments or locations, and ensure accountability.

In his work on cultural dimensions, Dutch organizational psychologist and anthropologist Geert Hofstede identified power distance as one of five key dimensions that shape national culture.

The physiological needs are the most basic and must be met before an individual can move on to higher levels of needs, such as safety or esteem. In other words, you have to take care of your physical requirements first before you can focus on other things like security, self-esteem or socializing. This hierarchy suggests that people are not capable of reaching their full potential until these needs are satisfied. Once the lower level needs are fulfilled, they no longer serve as a motivator; instead, they become dormant while the next set of needs emerges as a source of motivation. As such, it’s important for organizations to identify what stage of the pyramid employees currently fall into so that appropriate measures can be taken to help them progress upwards towards self-actualization. For example, if workers lack job security, focusing solely on developing creativity and problem-solving skills (which fall under “Esteem” category), may do very little to improve their performance. Instead, efforts should target ensuring the workplace environment feels safe and secure through measures such as offering training programs, promoting from within whenever possible, and encouraging open communication between management and staff. By satisfying this fundamental human need, individuals will feel more comfortable and confident which would then enable them to start tackling higher-order needs – leading to greater productivity, efficiency, and success overall. Ultimately, recognizing the importance of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs helps managers create effective development plans for each member of their team thereby unlocking everyone’s true potential.

Strong project and time management capabilities along with good decision-making abilities round out the core skills necessary to manage well in most industries today.
