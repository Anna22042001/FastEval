This is a necessary condition for the consequent to be true (neither the Aardvarks nor the Chipmunks can win if the Bees win). However, it's worth pointing out that this statement does not logically guarantee the truth of the consequent; there may be other ways for both the Aardvarks and Chipmunks to lose simultaneously. For example, suppose the Bees are playing against team X, the Aardvarks against team Y, and the Chipmunks against team Z. In order for the statement to be true, one of these three teams must necessarily win, but whether any of them will depends on how well they perform in their respective matches! Logic cannot predict random chance or unknown factors like player performance or weather conditions. Therefore, while we know the antecedent \"If the Bees win their first game\" implies the consequent \"then neither the Aardvarks nor the Chipmunks win their first games,\" we also recognize that this implication only holds under ideal circumstances where nothing unexpected happens during the course of the games. Real life is messy like that!\n\nHere's another way to think about it.
