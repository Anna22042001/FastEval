We can find the total number of days in that period using the following steps:\n\n1. Determine which day of the month February 19th falls on. Since February has 28 or 29 days depending on whether it's a leap year or not, we can assume it's either the 19th or 20th of the month.\n2. Count the number of days between February 19th/20th and March 10th, excluding those two dates. There are 20 days between February 19th/20th and March 10th.\n3. Add one extra day because we count both February 19th/20th and March 10th as separate days. So there are a total of 21 days between these two dates.\n\nNow let's apply the formula:\n\nInterest = $15.21 * 0.2199 * 21 days = $6.40\n\nTherefore, Jason has been charged $6.40 in interest from February 19th until March 10th, assuming he made no additional payments.
