However, providing such services should always align with relevant laws, regulations, and professional standards. In some cases, not charging fees might even violate applicable rules or result in exploitation (e.g., working for free could lead to undervaluation of your skills).

As with any action or decision, it's essential to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks when considering pro bono work offers or requests, ensuring compliance with relevant guidelines while also promoting social responsibility and justice. Ultimately, the appropriateness and morality of offering or accepting pro bono assistance will depend on an individual's values, goals, priorities, and beliefs, along with societal norms, cultural attitudes, and prevailing expectations.

The woman tells you that a friend of hers was trained in self-hypnosis for tension headaches and says that she also wants training in self-hypnosis. You took a weekend workshop on hypnosis in graduate school but have not used it in your clinical practice. As an ethical psychologist, you should:\nA) advise the woman that the underlying cause of her headaches would probably not be dealt with by self-hypnosis and suggest that she begin individual psychotherapy.\nB) accept the woman for treatment and begin training her in self-hypnosis but obtain consultation if you encounter any problems during the course of treatment.\nC) admit your lack of expertise in the use of self-hypnosis and refer the woman to another therapist.\nD) accept the woman for treatment and begin training her in self-hypnosis after reviewing your workshop notes.", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 19:32:10.660418+00:00"}

When faced with an approach-avoidance conflict, regardless of our proximity to the goal, the desire to approach the goal is equal to the desire to avoid it. This means that both approaching and avoiding the goal may be equally appealing or unappealing to us, causing a state of inner turmoil. As we move closer to the goal, the relative appeal or unpleasantness of these two options may change, but the overall balance between them remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"the closer we get to the goal, the stronger our desire to approach it\" (statement A) is incorrect because it implies that as we get closer to the goal, our desire to approach increases while our desire to avoid stays constant, which is not necessarily true in all cases. Similarly, the statement \"the closer we get to the goal, the stronger our desire to avoid it\" (statement C) is also incorrect for the same reason.\n\nStatement D, on the other hand, suggests that the strengths of our desires to approach and avoid the goal remain unaffected by our proximity to it, which is generally not accurate either since the perceived benefits and costs associated with approaching or avoiding the goal may change as we get closer or farther away from it. Therefore, statement B is the most accurate description of how we typically experience approach-avoidance conflicts.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhen faced with an approach-avoidance conﬂict:\nA) the closer we get to the goal, the stronger our desire to approach it.\nB) regardless of our proximity to the goal, the desire to approach the goal is equal to the desire to avoid it.\nC) the closer we get to the goal, the stronger our desire to avoid it.\nD) the strength of our desires to approach and to avoid the goal are unaffected by our proximity to it.", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 19:32:26.681512+00:00"}

Thus, option C is the best answer. Option A speaks to diversity and inclusion; option B refers to honesty and factual precision; and option D highlights non-maleficence (i.e., avoiding causing harm). All three of these options are important moral principles, but they do not accurately define what \"justice\" means. Justice fundamentally concerns treating people equitably based on relevant facts and applying impartial rules or laws consistently. In short, it entails giving people their due according to established legal procedures. Hence, recognizing fairness for all persons remains the most essential feature of justice. While there may be debates around how to achieve fair treatment and apply laws fairly across different contexts, at its core, justice revolves around ensuring that individuals receive an appropriate share of benefits/burdens based on their contributions and responsibilities within a given social order governed by established rules and norms.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nJustice primarily involves ___________.\nA) Respecting cultural and individual differences\nB) Promoting accuracy and truthfulness\nC) Recognizing fairness for all persons\nD) Benefitting others and “do no harm”", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 19:32:39.674667+00:00"}
