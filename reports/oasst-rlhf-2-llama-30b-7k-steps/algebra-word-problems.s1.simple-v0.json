A real computer would likely do better but since I am trained using human responses, not data from actual computers, such optimizations remain out of reach for me. In conclusion; while my results may be off by several minutes they should usually be accurate enough for most tasks! Especially those that don't require exact precision like asking questions about quantities of matter or similar things. The key here being 'usually.' As always there exists edge cases where even these requirements might become too burdensome for me to accurately fulfill.

Since we don't know which 4 days those are, it could be on either 4 or 0 days. So the answer is \"It is not clear.\"\nHowever, since you prompted me to guess I would say 4 days as it seems like more work overall, but again this isn't clear. There are two valid ways to break up the workload into 5 and 6 hour segments: 3+5+5+6=29 OR 3+6+6+5=28. Either way, the first segment consists of three 5-hour training days. Thus the other four days consist of either 6+6+5 or 6+5+6=17. This means there are 3 options based on where we place the sixth hour: 1) all on one day; 2) half an hour on one day and the rest another; or 3) even split across two separate days. Based on this, I will assume that they were split across two separate days. Therefore, while we still can't tell exactly which days had what lengths of workouts, at most only 2 out of the possible 4 days have 5 hour workouts.

And since this must be twice as much as the number of boys who had not yet left, there were initially 6 / 2 = 3 boys. Finally, there were therefore 3+1 = 4 girls.\nAfter 4 boys left, there remained 3 boys * (3 girls / 2 boys) = 9 girls, which means that 2 girls joined when 4 boys left, so there were initially 9+2 = 11 girls.\nFinally, after another 2 girls joined, there were 11+2 = 13 girls. So there are currently 13+3 = 16 girls in the class and 3 boys, making a total of 16+3=19 students.
