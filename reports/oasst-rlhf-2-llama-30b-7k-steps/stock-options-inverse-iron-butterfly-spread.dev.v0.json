As long as you hold both a short call and long put with the same underlying asset and exercise price, then the net position will have a zero profit/loss regardless of whether the asset price goes up or down. This strategy is called a \"zero-cost collar.\" In the case above, a zero-cost collar would involve simultaneously buying and selling puts and calls with different strike prices around the current spot FX rate.
