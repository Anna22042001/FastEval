In many species, both males and females are capable of lactating under certain circumstances, although males do not have the ability to bear children or breastfeed.[1]\n\nMilk produced from a cow during lactation can be used for dairy purposes such as making cheese, butter and ice cream, amongst other things. Humans can digest cows' milk due to having genes that allow them to tolerate the sugars present in it,[2][3][4] this however may change throughout time as the population grows older; studies on elderly people indicate they lose the ability to properly metabolize casein[5]. The lactose (a sugar found in milk), once broken down produces lactic acid which has several benefits for humans: firstly, it allows good bacteria known as probiotics to grow within the gut creating a healthy microbiome which makes up around two pounds of your body weight, secondly, it reduces the risk of heart disease as well as producing nitric oxide, which improves blood flow in your body[6], furthermore, reducing your blood pressure. It also helps regulate bowel movements along with boosting your immune system by helping fight off pathogens like Salmonella and E.

To accurately estimate how long filling up the entire Empire State Building would take using helium-filled party balloons, we need some additional information:\n\n* The size (diameter and/or circumference) of each individual balloon that you plan on using. Knowing this will enable us to calculate approximately how many balloons are needed to cover the surface area of every floor in the building. Since there are typically three sides per floor, we'll assume the average floor has roughly two balloons per side; therefore, we can use the formula for finding the number of triangles given a rectangle's length and width to get the total number of \"triangle faces\" per floor. We can then multiply this by the typical square footage per floor to find the total amount of space covered per floor, divide that figure by the effective coverage rate from all sides (accounting for the corners), and finally add some extra balloons to account for any spares. Using these calculations and estimations, we arrive at a rough figure of around 50 million to 60 million balloons required to completely fill the Empire State Building. Of course, this is only an estimation - your actual results may vary depending upon factors such as balloon size and inflation pressure, among other things.

It was one of the first states to pass legislation banning the importation of slaves into the country, and it eventually passed laws in the early 1800s freeing enslaved individuals born within its borders after a period of service to their masters. This made Rhode Island one of the first places in America where African-American communities began to flourish, contributing greatly to the culture and economy of the region through industries such as farming, fishing, and whaling.
