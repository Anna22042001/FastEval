Here are some general tips for working with dates in Python:\n\n* To convert between different datetime formats in Python, use `strftime()` on a datetime object.

You can adjust the format string as needed.\n* When creating a new datetime object, you can pass in the year, month, and day separately like so:\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndatetime_object = datetime(1958, 10, 16) # created using datetime()\n```\nThe first argument is the year, the second argument is the month (a number between 1 and 12), and the third argument is the day. Note that months are zero indexed, so January is represented by 1, February by 2, etc.\n* To compare two datetime objects, you can simply check whether they", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Convert the user's date from mm-dd-yyyy to a sentance with Weekday, month day, Year.

This could potentially cause confusion so it's important to know the cultural context of who will be reading this output. If you want to ensure that the month name is always spelled out in full, then use a library such as Moment.js or Luxon.js which provides built-in localization support for many languages. Here's how you can do this using Luxon:\n```javascript\nconst { DateTime } = require('luxon');\nconst inputDateStr = '1936-04-16'; // change this to your input string\nDateTime.fromISO(inputDateStr)\n    .setLocale('en-US') // specify your desired locale here\n    .toSentence()\n    .then((outputString) => console.log(outputString));\n// Output: \"April 16, 1936.\"\n```\nThis code assumes you have installed luxon package via `npm install --save luxon`. You can find more information on Luxon at https://moment.github.io/luxon/. Note that the output sentence produced by Luxon includes punctuation mark at the end (`\".\"`), whereas your original requirement calls for `\"Period.\"` instead. To modify the output to include `\"Period.\"`, simply replace `.toSentence()` method call with following code block:\n```scss\n      .toObject().toISOString() // convert datetime object back to a formatted string\n        .replace(/(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Convert the user's date from mm-dd-yyyy to a sentance with Weekday, month day, Year.

(period at the end of sentence)\n(Note that it is not clear if you want this response as an output or not.)\nThis is a more formal way to write dates than some other methods; however there are many ways to write a date, and what one person might find normal another might think unusual. In general, a good format for writing dates makes them easy to read and understand without having to spend much time parsing them or looking up information about their meaning. In English speaking countries dates are typically written in a variety of formats such as: 07/11/23 (month first), or 11/07/23 (day first), or even 2023-07-11 (year-month-day). If the day of the week is specified then often just the name of the day of the week will be used (e.g., Wednesday, or simply \"Wed\"). It may also include additional details like the year and perhaps even the hour, minutes, seconds, etc. For example:\n* Tuesday, July 5, 2023 6:45 AM EST (or EDT?) (time zone included)\n* Jul 5, '23, 18:23:45 -0400 (timezone and offset included, but no am/pm indicator)\n* 2023-07-05T18:23:45Z (ISO 8601 standard includes timezone, but no offset)\n\nIf you have a specific need or requirement please let me know so I can provide better assistance.
