Knowing this concept ahead of time can help simplify the problem considerably.\nAlso, I want to emphasize that while it may seem counterintuitive at first, the fact that your body doesn't cool down nearly as fast when you leave the shower does NOT invalidate the concept of the heating time constant. While bodies do have fairly high surface area to mass ratios compared to many objects, they also lose heat through convection and evaporation in addition to radiation and conduction.
