In some cases, banks may use dynamic currency conversion (DCC), where the merchant converts the charge into your home currency, resulting in potentially higher costs and unfavorable exchange rates compared to withdrawing money directly from the local ATM. It's always important to check with your bank about their policies regarding international transactions and ATM usage before traveling abroad. If there are any concerns or issues with the exchange rate, you should reach out to your bank or financial institution for clarification or assistance. To avoid potential problems, consider using debit cards instead of credit cards as they tend to offer better exchange rates and fewer hidden fees.

However, in some cases you can try contacting customer support directly through the website or calling their listed number. They might be able to provide you with options on how to troubleshoot this issue further or bypass certain restrictions. Ultimately though, gaining access to these types of services is intended to occur primarily through smartphone applications since they offer additional layers of security measures compared to traditional websites that could potentially result in unauthorized transactions occurring more easily due to a lack of multi-factor authentication mechanisms (such as biometric sensors, two factor authentication via email/SMS, etc). In summary, while we strive to accommodate customers who experience issues with logging in from various devices such as tablets or computers, the primary method of accessing most financial apps should still involve possessing a working mobile device registered under your name so that additional security features like two step verification via SMS or fingerprint scanning can help prevent any potential fraudulent activity from happening unknowingly until you regain control over your own personal property again. Our goal here is to prioritize protecting customer assets first and foremost, even if that means imposing limitations on users temporarily whenever they encounter technical difficulties with their hardware or software. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by situations like this but hope that customers understand the reasons behind these design decisions aimed at maintaining safety and trustworthiness within our platform overall.
