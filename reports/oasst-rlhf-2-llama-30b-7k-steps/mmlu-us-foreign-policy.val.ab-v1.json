Primacy seeks to maintain American preeminence over all potential rivals, ensuring no peer competitor emerges that could challenge U.S. leadership or impede access to critical regions and resources around the globe. It involves preserving a favorable balance of power through strengthening alliances and partnerships, expanding economic ties, investing in military capabilities, and shaping regional and global institutions. This approach often emphasizes maintaining unilateral freedom of action rather than relying on multilateral frameworks. Advocates argue primacy is necessary for protecting vital national security interests and promoting global stability, while critics contend it can be costly, destabilizing, and contrary to American values. A related concept is \"hegemony,\" which refers more broadly to exerting dominant influence within an established order without necessarily seeking absolute superiority. While some use these terms interchangeably, others differentiate between them based on whether the focus is on preventing rivalry (primacy) versus encouraging cooperation among weaker states (hegemony). The United States has pursued various strategies throughout its history, including periods of offshore balancing, retrenchment, and selective engagement. After World War II, Washington generally followed a policy of containment during the Cold War, aimed at stopping Soviet expansion and maintaining Western control over key areas like Europe and East Asia. With the collapse of the USSR, some analysts suggested America had achieved hegemony, though debate continues regarding how best to characterize this period.

This may seem petty or obstinate, but political parties often act this way because they believe it will help achieve more of what they want as a party in the future.

Finally, on the League of Nations itself: How successful do you think it could have been without American involvement? Did the treaty terms actually justify America not joining? Do you think another organization like the UN could avoid the same problems the League had? Would such organizations need to evolve anyway over time due to changes in world conditions or goals?

Bush found himself grappling with two important issues: determining a U.S. policy toward an unstable Soviet Union and dealing with an emerging independent Ukraine that had acquired nuclear weapons. Initially, President Bush pursued cautious engagement with the Soviet leadership in hopes of facilitating cooperation on arms control and economic reform while maintaining U.S. alliances in Europe. However, as instability continued to rock both the USSR and Eastern European countries, including those occupied by Soviet forces during World War II, the United States gradually began supporting independence movements. Although there were tensions between Washington and Moscow over several contentious issues--including U.S. aid to the Baltic states, particularly Lithuania; demands for a halt to ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia; and disagreements over strategic arms reduction talks--the first Bush Administration managed to avoid any major confrontations or crises. The president maintained cordial personal relations with Mikhail Gorbachev and later with Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, although he never established the same level of rapport with either leader as had Ronald Reagan before him.
