An integral domain is a commutative ring in which the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero. A field of quotients (also called a fraction field or a quotient field) of an integral domain is a field that contains the given integral domain and is formed by adjoining all fractions to the integral domain. For example, if we take the integral domain of integers, then its field of quotients will be rational numbers. So every integral domain does have a field of quotents. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"A polynomial of degree n over a ring can have at most n zeros counting multiplicity.\" - This statement is false for some cases. The statement is actually true only when the base ring is assumed to be a field. In general, a polynomial of degree n over a ring may have more than n zeros counting multiplicity. Consider the following example: Let R be a ring such that x^2 = 0. Now consider the polynomial f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1. Then it's easy to check that f(x) = (x + 1)^2, so all the roots of f(x) are x=-1, but there are only one zero counting multiplicity.

Here \"normal\" means both the mathematical meaning as well as \"not deviating from the standard\", so this is also a sanity check: Yes it makes sense to consider only functions which map normal subgroups to normal subgroups - they would be called endomorphisms of the group rather than general mappings/functions.\n\nThe proof is quite easy because any two cosets of a normal subgroup are either disjoint or identical ($gN=Ag$ for all $g \\in G$, where $N$ is the kernel of your function), therefore either one contains the other or they're equal. Therefore the preimage under our homomorphism f must contain at least one element of each such pair (because an injective mapping must have distinct images). That however directly implies the claim about the image, because any element can trivially generate its own coset (as we already showed above).\n\nTherefore this is true. The same argument goes through when swapping the roles of domain and codomain of course.\n\n- For statement 2: This statement is false without the additional assumption that $f$ is surjective! The reason lies in the fact that there may be many groups whose cardinalities divide some number $n$. Just take for example $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\times \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/4$.

Therefore, its order is 12. Answer: C).\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this conclusion:\n\nTo find the order of a finite group G, we need to find the number of elements in it. In this case, we have the group G = (Z_4 x Z_12)/(<2> x <2>), where Z_n denotes the cyclic group of integers mod n and <a> denotes the subgroup generated by an element a in a group. Since Z_4 x Z_12 has 16 elements, while <2> x <2> has only two elements, the resultant group must have a smaller number of elements. We can determine these elements by considering their properties as residue classes modulo 12. It turns out that the resulting set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} contains exactly one representative from each coset of both subgroups. This means that our group consists of all ordered pairs (x, y), where x belongs to Z_4 and y belongs to Z_12. The operation on this group is defined componentwise, i.e., (x_1, y_1)+(x_2,y_2)=(x_1+x_2mod4, y_1+y_2mod12). It follows that any element in this group can be written uniquely as either (0,y) or (1,y) for some y in Z_12. Hence, there are exactly 12 such elements, which is also equal to the cardinality of Z_{12", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nFind the order of the factor group (Z_4 x Z_12)/(<2> x <2>)\nA) 4\nB) 2\nC) 12\nD) 3", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 16:29:42.370595+00:00"}

This can also be understood by considering different number systems, like binary, octal etc., where raising a number to some power doesn't necessarily yield an integer at each step.

Certainly <3> is a subgroup of Z_6, so the quotient must have at least three elements. However, we can also argue that the only normal subgroup of Z_6 is {0}, which has index 6. Thus there is exactly one possible value for the size of this factor group:\n\nOrder(Z_6 / <3>) = |Z_6|/|<3>| = 6/3 = 2. So (B) is the right answer. Here's why D is not correct either: If N is a normal subgroup of Z_6 such that N < Z_6, then N must contain a generator, i.e., an element whose powers generate all of Z_6. Since 3 does not satisfy this property, it cannot be the case that <3> is a normal subgroup. In general, if you want to find the \"smallest\" normal subgroup containing some subset S of a cyclic group G, you should look for the smallest multiple m > 0 of the generator g of G such that g^m contains an element of S; the smallest such multiple will necessarily divide the order of S, but may be smaller than that unless S itself is generated by a power of g. This observation might help explain why we needed to use the fact that N was contained in a larger group like Z_6 above, in order to show that N could be normal.

Since the question asks for the \"maximum\" order, we choose 12.
