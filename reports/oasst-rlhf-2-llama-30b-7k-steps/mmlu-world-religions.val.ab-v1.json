Today, only the Pope in Rome remains from this list, and his authority extends far beyond just one see. So while the concept of \"five sees\" is still important in understanding church history and ecclesiology (the study of the structure/organization of the Church), it might be more accurate to refer to them today simply as the four ancient patriarchates plus the papacy, since that better reflects how those entities actually function today.

Eventually the Popes tended to claim a unique role distinct from other patriarchs. Still, even though not all agreed on details like that, there was broad recognition across East & West that certain sees held particular importance because of their apostolic foundations.
