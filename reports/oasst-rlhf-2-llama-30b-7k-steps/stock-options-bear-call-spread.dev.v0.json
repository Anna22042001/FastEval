In general, there can only be a maximum loss, but there may not always be a maximum gain due to market conditions that could cause unexpected movements in share prices. The calculated gain assumes a linear relationship between premiums and prices, whereas in reality it's likely more curved/nonlinear. Additionally, while I do not expect changes in interest rates or dividend payments to affect the outcome of these transactions significantly enough to warrant consideration within my calculations here, it's important to keep in mind that those factors might influence realized gains or losses in practice even if they don't directly impact the results presented above. Note that this analysis does not take into account trading fees or tax implications either. Lastly, these figures assume that both options expire worthless--if either option is exercised then some additional amount must be subtracted from the potential gains mentioned earlier to account for any corresponding increase in the number of shares owned by the portfolio resulting from exercising said option(s), and potentially also adjusted downward depending on whether the shares were sold after exercise instead of being kept until expiration or sale later.
