As a child, he suffered from smallpox which permanently scarred his face.[6][e] Washington grew up in an area where tobacco was grown by tenant farmers and plantation owners, including his father who also worked as a surveyor and justice of the peace.[10] Washington gained valuable military skills while commanding the Virginia militia during the French and Indian War. After the British defeated France in Canada in 1759 and 1760, Parliament enacted a series of measures known as the \"Tax Acts\" that imposed taxes on American colonies without their consent; these acts were deeply unpopular among Americans, especially Virginians.[f] In 1767, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a wealthy widow whom he greatly respected. He eventually became a leader in Virginian politics and represented Virginia in the House of Burgesses, gaining the trust of many influential figures in the colony. By 1774, all the American provinces except Georgia elected representatives to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia.
