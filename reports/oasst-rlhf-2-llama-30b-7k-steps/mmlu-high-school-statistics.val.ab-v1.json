Constructing confidence intervals involves taking samples from populations, so differences in levels of accuracy are due solely to variation in the sampling process and do not result from differences in levels of confidence. Therefore, as long as the two intervals are calculated using data from the exact same set of people, their lengths should be identical. Although we would expect that a larger sample size would lead to more accurate estimates, this effect applies equally to all levels of confidence, so it does not explain why some intervals are longer than others within any given sample. In general, therefore, different levels of confidence only affect how likely our intervals are to contain the real value of whatever quantity we're measuring; once an interval has been selected, its properties are fixed regardless of how confident we are that it accurately reflects the world. Confidence intervals are useful tools for making decisions based on uncertain data by specifying how plausible certain values seem based on what we know. By choosing a desired probability associated with each potential interval—that is, a specific level of confidence—we can ensure that most of the time, if we think there's a particular chance that something is true, our calculations won't let us down. For example, although constructing a 95% confidence interval from a given dataset might give us slightly less information about where the \"true\" parameter lies than one with a 99% confidence level would, the 95% interval is much more reliable: If we draw many such intervals from many datasets like this one, almost all of them will actually contain the true parameter about 95% of the time.

A sample could representatively replace the need for a full census when populations get very big, especially if the goal is to understand the diversity within the group (like different types of professors). For smaller populations like a single school, surveys may also be appropriate. But a census remains useful for small homogeneous populations like fish or construction workers.

This describes a case study design rather than an observational study which involves simply observing the state of nature without interference by the researcher beyond that required to maintain conditions suitable for observation. There are several types of observational studies including cross sectional, case control, cohort studies and panel data designs. Strictly speaking, none of these are experimental since there is no random assignment to treatments (or absence of treatment). Instead, participants are observed under whatever circumstances they find themselves. The only exceptions might be where participants are randomly assigned to different time periods for example in a before after study or where participants are randomly allocated to different locations, e.g., comparing outcomes across two towns: one with a new public health programme compared to another town not implementing this policy change. These would also meet the definition of being a true experiment although the latter could also be described as a natural experiment. Thus the 'random allocation' part of the above definition would be met. However, both of those examples are relatively rare and most observational studies do not have a concurrent comparison group. As such the 'comparison' element is missing from most cases - just because people were exposed at a later date does not mean that their outcomes will be similar had exposure never occurred! Without a concurrent comparison group we cannot rule out confounding so cannot claim a causal conclusion based upon association alone.

This can occur due to various factors such as nonresponse, selection bias, or measurement errors. As a result, it can lead to incorrect estimates of population parameters and invalid conclusions. Therefore, the correct answer is B. In contrast, prejudice (A), tendencies for distributions to be skewed (C), and natural variability between samples (D) are not considered sources of bias in survey research. Instead, they are related to other statistical concepts.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. A) Prejudice: While prejudice can certainly influence responses to survey questions, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like ethnicity and gender, this is not typically referred to as \"bias\" in the context of survey research. Instead, social desirability bias might be more relevant here, which occurs when respondents provide answers they believe to be socially acceptable rather than their true opinions.\n2. C) Skewness: The term \"skewness\" describes the asymmetry of a distribution. While a skewed distribution can affect inferences made from survey data, it is not considered a form of bias. However, if a sample exhibits skewness due to systemic exclusion of certain groups (e.g., low-income individuals being underrepresented), then this could be considered a form of selection bias.\n3. D) Natural variability: All samples will have some degree of randomness and inherent variation. This natural variability does not constitute bias unless there is evidence of systemic error in the sampling process. For example, if one segment of a population has a higher probability of inclusion in a sample, resulting in overrepresentation, then this would be considered a source of bias.\n\nRemember that understanding the types of biases present", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nIn sample surveys, what is meant by bias?\nA) Prejudice, as in ethnic and gender-related studies.\nB) A systematic error in a sampling method that leads to an unrepresentative sample.\nC) Tendency for some distributions to be skewed.\nD) Natural variability seen between samples.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 18:15:15.976039+00:00"}
