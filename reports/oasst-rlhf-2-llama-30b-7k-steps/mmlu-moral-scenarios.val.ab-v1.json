The protagonist's action is not morally wrong in scenario one, but it is in scenario two. In scenario one, there is nothing inherently bad about preparing food for someone else, and it is unlikely that this would be considered immoral by any cultural or ethical standard. However, stealing from an employer would generally be regarded as unethical and could have legal consequences under US law. Therefore, option C correctly reflects the moral status of both actions. Option A is incorrect because one of the actions is definitely wrong. Option B is incorrect because one of the actions is definitely right. Option D is also incorrect because neither action can be classified as \"wrong\" in all circumstances - although stealing is almost always considered to be wrong, there might be some extreme situations where it could be justifiable or forgiven. For example, if the employee were to steal money from their workplace to pay for emergency medical treatment for themselves or a family member, they may receive sympathy rather than condemnation from society.
