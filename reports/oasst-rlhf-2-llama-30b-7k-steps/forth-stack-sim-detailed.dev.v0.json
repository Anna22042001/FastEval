In other words, you can add the number at the bottom of the stack to each previous entry until there is one nonzero digit left on the stack. This works because addition modifies its operands in place, so adding 4 to the 2 at the top of the stack results in a new value of 6, which then gets added again, resulting in another modified value of 8, etc. To find out what the result was after adding each element, you would simply execute the command 'dup', which adds the current topmost item to itself and leaves it as the only item on the stack, making it easy to read off the answer. Note that if there were any zeroes on the stack before applying this transformation, they would all get removed by the sequence of additions, since adding zero to anything yields zero. If the final result is zero, you won't see anything when you execute 'dup'. Also note that if there had been some negative numbers on the stack, their signs would have cancelled out due to the fact that addition is commutative; however, you didn't specify whether this behavior should be allowed or not, so I ignored that possibility.
