It is secreted into the extracellular matrix of these tissues as a polymeric precursor called tropoelastin. Tropoelastin undergoes post-translational modification to form mature elastin. This process includes crosslinking by lysyl oxidases and other enzymes, which creates a stable network of interconnected filaments. The resulting elastic fiber gives tissues their elasticity and recoilability.\n\nElastin's secondary structure consists primarily of coiled beta strands rather than alpha helices. However, some parts of its sequence may form short alpha helical segments. Nonetheless, the primary structural features contributing to elastin's function are the repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues along its length, which drive its formation of a rod-like polymer, and specific amino acid motifs critical for interactions with other proteins involved in the assembly or maintenance of elastic fibers.\n\nIn contrast, many globular proteins (e.g., those serving as enzymes, signaling molecules, or structural components within cells) have different structures well-suited for their respective functions. These generally involve arrangements emphasizing exposed surface areas rich in polar or charged residues facilitating binding to other moieties like substrates, cofactors, or interacting partner proteins.

The kin selection theory explains how heritable traits can increase an organisms chance of survival and reproduction thereby increasing the representation of those traits in succeeding generation. An example of this is shown in birds where they use alarm calls to alert other birds in their group of danger. These birds do not sound the alarm just for themselves but also for others in their group. It is thought that birds which are more closely related are more likely to respond to these alarm calls. This helps explain why some animals help each other even though there could be negative consequences to them doing so. By helping others in their group animals are ensuring that their own offspring have a better chance of surviving since they are part of a larger group. This type of selflessness in turn helps ensure that the animal's genes get passed on to future generations through the success of their family unit.\n\nReference: https://study.com/academy/lesson/kin-selection-definition-example-quiz.html\n\nQuiz Question: Which of the following statements best describes the process of kin selection?
