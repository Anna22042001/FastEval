This allows for the identification and distinction of different functional groups within a molecule. The chemical shifts of the carbon atoms in a molecule are influenced by factors such as the hybridization state of the adjacent atom(s), the presence of electronegative substituents, and the number and kind of bonds connected to the carbon atom. In general, alkyl carbons tend to have higher chemical shift values than other types of carbons.\n\nIn the case of the isomers of C6H14 mentioned in your question, each isomer contains six carbon atoms that may be differentiated based on their chemical shift values. However, only one of these isomers (2-methylpentane) exhibits multiple distinct chemical shifts among its carbon atoms in its 13C NMR spectrum. Therefore, this is the correct response to the given query.

In fact, hybridization involves changing the symmetry properties of an atom's orbitals (usually by rearrangement of the orbitals themselves). For example, in the case of methane, there are three equivalent CH3 groups arranged around a central carbon atom. To achieve this arrangement, each terminal carbon-hydrogen bond must be the same length, so that all three hydrogens are equidistant from the carbon atoms. This can only occur if the carbon atom is also symmetrical, i.e., the carbon-hydrogen bonds have the same length. Carbon forms four new orbitals which point towards the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, giving each hydrogen atom an identical environment. Since the original six valence orbitals on the carbon atom were all equivalent, they remained unchanged; however, the two sets of orbitals do not interfere with one another since they are nondegenerate. As a result, the resulting four orbitals formed after hybridization have the same energy, which results in their being called \"hybrid\" orbitals. Hybrids are always orthogonal to the original basis states, meaning that the linear combination that defines them contains no coefficients with the same sign. In contrast, the orbitals generated by the usual molecular symmetry operations corresponding to rotation and reflection are usually not orthogonal but form irreducible representations of the molecule's symmetry group. These orbitals often lie at different energies due to quantum mechanical effects and are termed as degenerated orbitals. Therefore, the correct option among the four options given above would be B.
