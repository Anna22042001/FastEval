Since it's a truth value, it will always evaluate to true. Therefore, the entire expression becomes \"(true or (not (true or not not true) or not false)).\n2. Not(True Or Not True) - This is now evaluated in parentheses because we need to determine the truth value of this sub-expression before moving on to the next part. Since \"or\" has higher precedence than \"not\", the evaluation goes like this: not (true or not true). Both \"true\" and \"not true\" are considered separately. As you know, any non-empty string represents true while empty one does not. Hence, \"not true\" also turns out to be true here. So the result of this step is not(true or not true), which evaluates to not(null) = null (Since both values are equal).\n3. Not Null - Now that we have determined the value of the previous sub-expression, we can move forward with the rest of the expression. Here, we encounter \"or\". We apply the same rules mentioned earlier: \"or\" has higher precedence over \"not\". therefore, the expression becomes not(null or not false). At this point, since we already established that null is equivalent to False, so the whole thing reduces to not(null or false). Since both conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously, it returns null (which means False according to our previously established rule).\n4. Conclusion - Finally, after having examined all parts of the original expression, we get back to where we started. Our final answer depends on whether the last value we obtained was null or false.
