Sales are often advertised using different types of signage such as 'Sale', 'Clearance', and 'Reduced' signs. These signs help draw attention to products that are currently available at discounted prices, encouraging customers to make purchases they might not normally consider if the items were not on sale. Therefore, option (A) is correct, while options B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B suggests that having extra stock in inventory could indicate a bargain to customers, which may not always be the case. Option C suggests that odd numbers could signal a sale, but this is untrue; odd-number pricing refers to setting prices ending in '.99' instead of rounded figures like $10. Lastly, option D suggests that relative pricing would communicate to customers that a product is cheaper than another similar product, but it does not necessarily imply that it's on sale. Instead, relative pricing is commonly used alongside other pricing strategies to show how a product compares to others within its category.\n\nIn summary, sale signs effectively act as cues that tell customers about existing sales, making them more likely to purchase items from the retailer. By recognizing these signals, customers can take advantage of sales and potentially save money when shopping.\n\nLearning Outcome: Students will learn about sale signs and how they function as cues in retail stores, enabling customers to identify bargains and discounted products. They will also gain knowledge about different types of pricing strategies employed by businesses and understand how each strategy works to influence consumer behavior. The lesson plan will encourage students to analyze various scenarios involving sales and deals, providing opportunities for", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\n___________ act as cues by indicating to a potential customer that there is a bargain to be had.\nA) Sale signs.\nB) Price surplus.\nC) Odd-number pricing.\nD) Relative price.", "options": ["A"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 18:46:52.210335+00:00"}

Bollywood films are produced primarily for viewers from South Asia or people of South Asian descent across the globe; they frequently deal with social issues as well as melodramatic plots involving romance, family feuds, honour, etc. The music played during these movies is very catchy and often contains dance sequences which have made it famous throughout the whole world. Some may argue that this form of marketing is unethical because its purpose is to sell products by exploiting stereotypes about certain races, however since the beginning of mass media advertising has always tried to group individuals into different categories and use those groups to sell their own product.
