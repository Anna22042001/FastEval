Corporate governance deals with the relationships among stakeholders involved in a company, including shareholders, management, employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, activists, and others. One key issue in corporate governance is dealing with the different interests and powers of these various stakeholder groups. The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has argued that corporate governance problems often arise due to conflicts between the interests of different stakeholder groups and imbalances in the distribution of power among them. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because profit maximization is not necessarily the only or even primary goal of all organizations, and many other factors may influence decision making. Option C is also incorrect because managers do not always act solely in their own self-interest; they may be influenced by a variety of factors such as organizational goals, legal requirements, ethical considerations, and pressure from stakeholders.
