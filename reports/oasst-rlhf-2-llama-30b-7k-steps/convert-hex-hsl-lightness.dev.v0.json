In our case, the red component R will be equal to the most significant byte. The green and blue components G and B will be determined by taking the least significant byte divided by two and adding the most significant byte multiplied by four. We can calculate the luminance or brightness Y as the weighted sum of the three primary colors. Specifically, for white light, Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B. For grayscale, all components have the same value, which means Y = 0.5 RGB. To find the saturation S, we take the maximum difference between any two components and divide it by the sum of all three components. Finally, we compute the hue angle H in radians using a formula involving arctangents.\nWe need the hue angle to determine if the color falls under \"warm\" (red, orange, yellow) or \"cool\" (green, blue, purple) colors. If H > 120, H -= 180; otherwise, if H < -120, H += 180. Then we set H to its positive half cycle (H <= 360). With H now in the interval [0, 360), we classify warm colors as those where H is in the interval [0, 120], cool colors as those where H is in the interval [120, 240], and neutral colors", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a concise color conversion bot that takes in a hex code representing a color, converts it to HSL, and then replies with the lightness value of that hex code as a percentage (to the nearest whole number)."}, {"role": "system", "content": "What is the lightness value of the hex code #721cb6?", "name": "example_user"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The lightness value of the hex code #721cb6 is 41%.", "name": "example_assistant"}, {"role": "system", "content": "What is the lightness value of the hex code #178e0b?", "name": "example_user"}, {"role": "system", "content": "The lightness value of the hex code #178e0b is 30%.", "name": "example_assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the lightness value of the hex code #c4f701?"}], "options": ["The lightness value of the hex code #c4f701 is 49%."]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-10 19:31:58.758612+00:00"}

For example, for #721cb6, the hue is 112° (since \"72\" in hexadecimal corresponds to 112 in decimal).\nSaturation/Intensity: Determines how vivid or desaturated the color appears. This can be calculated from the difference between the maximum possible RGB values for each component (255) and the actual values found in the hex code.\nLightness: A measure of how dark or bright the color appears. Calculate this as the average of the three RGB components.\n\nSo, for #721cb6, we have:\n\n* Hue: 112°\n* Saturation: (255-172)/255 = 0.8\n* Lightness: (172+172+172)/3 = 172/3 = 57.33...
