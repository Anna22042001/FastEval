The operation of this system involves two main proteins called LacI (repressor) and LacR (activator). When there are high levels of glucose in the cell cytoplasm, they bind strongly to specific sites on DNA called operators. This prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing genes into mRNAs which can be translated into enzyme proteins. With no protein production, the cell cannot digest lactose into other compounds.\n\nIf a mutation occurs such that LacI does not have an active site for glucose binding or fails to bind at all to its operator site, then LacI would not interfere with gene expression even if there was plenty of glucose available. Without sufficient LacI repression of gene expression, some amount of transcription might occur depending on how much activating power exists due to the presence of inducer molecules like lactose. In the absence of lactose however, expression will still likely remain relatively low because without added inducing factors, baseline activity for synthesis of LacZ, LacY and LacA enzyme proteins from their respective genes remains very weak in comparison to strong suppression by LacI. Thus option (A) above best describes what we expect in this scenario. \n\nTo summarize: a non-functional LacI repressor allows for more freedom of expression than before but unless lots of activating factors are also present, overall expression of lac operon genes remains fairly limited compared to normal unperturbed cells maintaining strict control over these genetic elements.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAssuming that the level of glucose is low, a mutation in the repressor of the lac operon in E. coli, preventing binding of the repressor to the operator, should result in:\nA) lack of expression or reduced expression of the lac operon genes under all circumstances\nB) expression of the genes only when lactose is present\nC) constitutive expression of the lac operon genes\nD) expression of the genes only when lactose is absent", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-15 18:48:22.766780+00:00"}
