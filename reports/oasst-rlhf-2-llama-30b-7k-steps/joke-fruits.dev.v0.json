If there is no further context provided, it would not be possible to determine whether the information presented is intended to be humorous or not. However, based solely on the content of the passage, it does not appear to be written with humor as its primary purpose. It reads like a factual account of the history and growth of the company Apple Inc. rather than attempting to be comedic.\n\nIn order to better assess whether the material is intended to be funny, additional context or clarification may need to be provided. For example, if the text were part of a larger work such as a satirical article, essay, or book, that context could help provide insight into whether the content is meant to be humorous or not. Without additional context, though, it is difficult to make a determination about the intentional use of humor in the passage.\n\nThat being said, some people might find aspects of the passage amusing due to their familiarity with Apple products or cultural references associated with the brand, even if those elements weren't explicitly designed to be funny. Humor can sometimes be subjective and influenced by individual perspectives, experiences, and background knowledge.
