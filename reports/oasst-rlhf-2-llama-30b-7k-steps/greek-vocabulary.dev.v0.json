However, we can use different methods to translate these words into their closest meanings, but they might not convey the exact meaning of the original word.\n\nOne such example is the Greek word Αρρενωπός (Arrenopós), which means \"man-faced\" or \"having a man's face,\" but it could also imply someone who behaves like a man or possesses male qualities regardless of gender. In this case, you might choose to write \"N,\" indicating that the specific word does not exist in Greek, but a similar concept or idea may still be expressed using other phrases or words. To better understand this point, consider the following examples from everyday life:\n\n1. Someone says, \"I need a coffee machine.\" Although \"coffee machine\" doesn't exist as a single word in Greek, we can express the same thought by saying \"καφέ αλμυρίδι\" (kafé almíri) or \"κάψουλες καφές\" (kápsules kafés).\n2.
