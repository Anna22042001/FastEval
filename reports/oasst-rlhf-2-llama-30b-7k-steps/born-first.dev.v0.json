Garfield and William Henry Harrison (the shortest serving president). However two of them died on the same day they were inaugurated which is April 4th and April 5th respectively so their birthday celebrations aren't that special compared to others.\n\nWhich other presidents share birthdays? Two presidents have been born on July 4th which is Independence Day. They are John Adams (who also died on July 4th) and Thomas Jefferson who was one of the founding fathers of the United States. The only president to be born on Thanksgiving Day was George H. W. Bush. He has also served as a vice president under Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989. And then there were three presidents born on Christmas Day including James Polk, Millard Fillmore, and Andrew Johnson. So technically if you believe Jesus was actually born on December 25th then all these presidents shared his birthday! There are many more coincidences like this one between US Presidents but I think these would make for some fun trivia facts during your next dinner party!
