In his essay \"Discipline and Indiscipline,\" Rabindranath Tagore discusses several topics related to education, including the importance of individual creativity, the role of tradition in shaping students' lives, and the dangers of excessive conformity. However, he also raises questions about the relationship between education and society. For example, Tagore suggests that modern education often fails to prepare students adequately for life outside of school. Furthermore, he argues that the current emphasis on rote learning and standardized testing undermines children's natural curiosity and love of learning. As a result, many students graduate without having acquired the skills they need to succeed in the world beyond academia. Ultimately, Tagore urges educators to rethink their approach to teaching and learning, in order to promote greater creativity, innovation, and adaptability among students. According to Tagore, what are some limitations of modern education?

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.
