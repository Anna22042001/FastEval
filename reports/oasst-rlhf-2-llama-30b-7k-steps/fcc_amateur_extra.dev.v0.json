To find out, I reviewed the relevant information about amateur radio license regulations regarding the 17m band. In particular, I found details about what subbands and emissions are permitted within it. From those sources, here's some key info relevent to this question:\n- On 17m, there is an RTTY/data segment between 18.068-18.120 MHz. It includes two channels: 18.080-18.100 MHz and 18.100-18.120 MHz. Within these segments, any emission type except FM is authorized. That means AM, SSB, CW, as well as various digital mode types like RTTY, PSK31, etc., can be used. No restrictions apply to USB or LSB modes.\nSo based on this knowledge, we can eliminate some options right away:\n- Option A is wrong because it lies within the allowed RTTY/data segment range, so any emission type is legal there. Same goes for option D, which is also inside the segment. So neither of these is the correct answer.\n- This leaves us with options B and C.
