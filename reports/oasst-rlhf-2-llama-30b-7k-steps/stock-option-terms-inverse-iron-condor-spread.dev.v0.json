The short put gives you exposure to potential gains if the stock price stays above $125 (the strike price) at expiration, while limiting your losses below that level. The long put acts as insurance against large declines in the stock price, but has limited upside beyond the difference between the strike prices ($130 - $125 = $5). Similarly, the short call provides exposure to potential gains if the stock price remains below $175 (the strike price), while also having limited downside due to the premium received from selling the option. On the other hand, the long call gives you exposure to potential gains if the stock price rises above $170 (the strike price) at expiration, which can offset any losses on the short puts and calls. However, both the short and long options lose value as time passes and their implied volatility decreases, which means their market values will tend to converge over time. As a result, when the underlying asset price increases, it tends to decrease the relative value of the short options and increase the relative value of the long options, leading to a net positive effect on the overall portfolio return. Therefore, an increase in stock price is generally preferable for this particular trading strategy.
