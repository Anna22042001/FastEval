The net profit would be the premium received from selling the $143 strike price put ($0.94 x 100 = $94). However, since you also bought another put with a higher strike price ($130), your net profit would still be lower due to the cost of buying that put ($0.23 x 100 = $23). Therefore, your maximum gain would be $94 - $23 = $71.\nScenario B (Stock Price < $130):\nSince the $130 strike price put was purchased at $0.23 per share, it represents a minimum floor for the stock's price below which you cannot lose any more money. In this case, the most you can gain is the difference between the stock price and the sold call strike price minus the premiums paid for both puts.
