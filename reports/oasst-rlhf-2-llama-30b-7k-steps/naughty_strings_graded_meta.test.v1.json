The presence of script tags: This indicates that the content within the tag is JavaScript code designed to execute client-side actions in a web browser. While not all scripts are necessarily malicious, they can often hide harmful payloads or exploit vulnerabilities in browsers.\n2. The use of an alert function: This is a built-in function in JavaScript that displays a message box with the specified text, which can be used to trick users into divulging sensitive information. Malware authors sometimes employ alert boxes to steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data entered by unsuspecting users.\n3. The `javascript:` pseudo-protocol: This prefix typically appears before a URL that starts with `javascript:`.
