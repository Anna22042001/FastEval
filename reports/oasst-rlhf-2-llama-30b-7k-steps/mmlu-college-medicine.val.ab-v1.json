Adrenaline (epinephrine) secretion during exercise increases via a reflex arc that starts in the brain and ends in the adrenal medulla. This pathway involves activation of postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system whose cell bodies are located in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. The axons of these preganglionic neurons synapse directly on chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline into circulation. There is also some direct innervation of the adrenal medulla by sympathetic fibers. The source of epinephrine in white blood cells has been suggested as an additional contributor to its release into circulation but this is not yet clear. Increased plasma levels of lactate or ATP do not appear to be primary triggers for adrenaline release. Norepinephrine is often released along with smaller amounts of other catecholamines such as dopamine. In contrast to the situation in cardiac failure where there can be unopposed alpha-1 receptor mediated vasoconstriction due to unopposed norepinephrine release, the beta-2 receptor mediated vasodilation which occurs concurrently prevents most symptoms of hypertension. Exercise also causes local release of cytokines, prostaglandins, and purines from muscle tissue, but again it appears that the trigger for adrenaline release is primarily increased sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system.

Tropomyosin and troponin are important for regulation but do not directly contribute to force production. Myosin and actin together make up the majority of protein content within a muscle fibre (sarcomere).
