The sorted subarrays are then combined to form the final sorted array. This process is repeated until all elements of the original array are sorted. Because binary tree sort modifies the input array as it performs itssorting operation, it can be considered an in-place sorting algorithm. In other words, no additional memory is needed to perform the sort beyond the space required to store the input array itself. Other examples of in-place sorting algorithms include insertion sort and selection sort. On the other hand, some non-in-place sorting algorithms such as mergesort and quicksort require additional memory to perform their sorting operations.\nb)False. Although binary tree sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that does not need extra space, insertion sort and selection sort are also in-place sorting algorithms that modify the input array as they perform their sorting operation. All three algorithms therefore qualify as in-place sorting algorithms. However, merge sort and quick sort are non-in place sorting algorithms that need more memory than just the size of the input array, although they do produce better performance compared to in-place algorithms like insertion sort or selection sort.

The algorithm works by recursively splitting the input array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element. This takes log n time, as we need log n splits to reduce an array of size n to an array of size 1. Once all the subarrays contain just one element, they can be easily reassembled in their correct order in linear time (O(n)). Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n). However, since the input array may not always be perfectly balanced, there may be some cases where the worst-case performance of the algorithm is slightly worse than O(n log n). For example, if the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted, then the algorithm's performance will degrade to O(n^2) due to unnecessary comparisons between adjacent elements. Nevertheless, even in these worst-case scenarios, the algorithm still performs better than many other comparison-based sorting algorithms such as MergeSort, which also has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).

The correct answer is (a). Binary tree sort has a worst case complexity of O(n log n), while quicksort has a worst case complexity of O(n^2). Although both sorts may use different data structures as work areas (binary tree or an array for quicksort), neither uses a Binary Search Tree specifically. Additionally, binary tree sort's efficiency increases linearly with increasing input size, whereas quicksort remains more constant. Lastly, although both types of sorting can be done in-place, they do not necessarily always require that implementation. Therefore, answers (b) and (d) are also incorrect. Answer (c) is true - as the input size grows larger, so does the relative advantage of using binary tree sort over quicksort when considering only worst-case complexities. Answer (e) is incorrect since there are other sorts which outperform both binary tree sort and quicksort on certain inputs, such as Merge Sort and Heap Sort.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA) False; Binary tree sort and quick sort do NOT have the same running time.

The correctness of my response may depend on additional context information which was not provided in your original question. If I made any incorrect assumptions then my answer could potentially be wrong even though it would still correspond to one of the given options. In such cases it may be necessary to further clarify our respective interpretations before proceeding. For example: do you mean 'height' as in number of levels, or perhaps something else entirely? Similarly, what exactly does the array represent - node values, pointers between adjacent layers, something else again? More details on these points might help us determine whether my suggested answer remains valid under all reasonable definitions of these terms. Without more context, there could potentially be alternative interpretations which lead to different answers being correct instead. However, assuming the most natural interpretation based on the words used herein, option (c) should be the right pick.

If the parent node is already present in memory and if the key being inserted is smaller than any other keys in its left subtree or larger than any other keys in its right subtree then we don't need to do any further comparison, hence a = 0.\nIn this case we can see that after inserting 12 only one more comparison is required i.e., between 12 and 4 which is 1 so total number of comparisons would be 4 + 1 = 5.

If we consider that an algorithm or implementation requires more lines of code then it's true since dynamic memory allocation is required to make sure there aren't any gaps when adding new nodes. This means that we need additional functions for allocating and deallocating memory which makes the task at hand more complex, although not impossible or even especially challenging.\n\nTo summarize: The disadvantage here is that it takes longer to write because we must allocate and deallocate memory dynamically, but it isn't necessarily difficult once implemented. Therefore I believe that (c) being the only technically incorrect answer should receive 0 points and either (a), (b), or both should be given points instead. My final score would be (a+b):1, c:0, d:1 where some may argue that (a)=1, (b)=1, (c)=0, (d)=1 if they believe that writing the extra code for memory allocation is very challenging. As usual, these sorts of questions tend to have ambiguity unless one can clarify exactly what the word 'challenging' mean with respect to a specific implementation or set of requirements. In general, I try my best to provide accurate answers to your questions, but sometimes these types of gray area issues arise. Hopefully I provided clarification as to why I chose 'c'.
