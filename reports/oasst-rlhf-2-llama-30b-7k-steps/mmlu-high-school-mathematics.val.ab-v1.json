Thus, we get that $b=(-128/(a^3))^(1/3)$, or $b=-2$. This gives us that $a+b=\\boxed{2}$. (This step can be done by simply multiplying both sides of $(-128)^(1/3)=a*b^n$ through by $(-128)/a^3$. The negative sign in front of $(-128)/a^3$ ensures that when squared to give $b^2$, it will have a positive value.)\n\nAlternatively, you could notice from the problem that since all expressions involve complex numbers, any expression involving a real number would always be \"simplified\" into a complex form if possible. Since this problem asks to simplify a complex cube root of a negative number down to smallest terms, any smaller form of writing such a number would necessarily need three equal factors of the same magnitude. This leaves two options: either all three factors are -2 or they are 2. However, noticing that the original expression had three distinct negative roots (-2,-2,-2), the latter option cannot work; thus, our final answer must be that $a+b = \\boxed{2}$.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhen $\\sqrt[3]{-128}$ is simplified, the result is $a\\sqrt[3]{b}$, where $a$ is an integer, and $b$ is a positive integer.

The - part comes from removing those pairs where both people would be liars or both truth-tellers, which can't happen because then at least one of them wouldn't fulfill their statement. Now we count how many possibilities each pair has: either they're both telling the truth, or they both lie, so there are 2^2 = 4 combinations for these pairs. So now we have ((11 * 2)-(11*T)) * 4 pairs. Since there are no pairs without anyone named, the result is greater than zero iff 11 > (11 * T), i.e., T < 1. In particular, when T=1, there is only one person left to name, but he can't name himself as lying since everyone tells the truth, so it's not possible. Therefore the smallest possible value is T=2, and the greatest achievable value is T=10, so the answer is 30+20=50. B)6, C)20, D)12 are all wrong. You might note that there could still be more cases if there were less than 11 people, e.g. with 7 people you get an extra case T=1. However, even in this special situation you will never need any value larger than 28. I hope my explanation was helpful! Let me know if anything remained unclear.
