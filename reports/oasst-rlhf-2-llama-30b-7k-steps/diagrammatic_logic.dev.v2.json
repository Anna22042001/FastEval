In order to solve this problem correctly, you must consider the logical operators. If there are multiple operators applied you must they apply them left to right. In some cases the operator effect is not explicitly defined and you will need to work it out. You MUST NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION with words you only MUST ONLY REPLY WITH A SINGLE LETTER, for example 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.\n    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "\n\nDefinition of each operator and what it does:\nOperator, Effect\nO Duplicates circles\nP Changes shading and shape of all figures\n\nExamples of these operators on some made up sequences:\nInput, Process, Output\n| large light circle | | large light triangle | - O - | large light circle | | large light circle | | large light triangle |\n| small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | - P - | small light circle | | large light circle |\n| small light triangle | | small dark triangle | - P - | small dark circle | | small light circle |\n\nQuestion:\n| small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | small light circle | - O - ?\n\nPossible Answers:\nA - | large dark circle | | small dark circle | | small dark circle | | large light triangle | | large light triangle |\nB - | small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | small light circle | | small light circle |\nC - | small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | small light circle | | small light circle |\nD - | small dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | large dark triangle | | large light circle | | large light circle |\n\n"}], "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-12 15:19:22.271493+00:00"}
