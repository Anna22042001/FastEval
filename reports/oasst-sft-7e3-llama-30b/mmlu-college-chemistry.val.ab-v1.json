In the case of a 1 M solution of TEMPO in chloroform at room temperature, the EPR spectrum shows broader lines compared to a 1 mM solution. This broadening can be attributed to the slower tumbling motion of the TEMPO molecules in the more concentrated solution.\n\nIn solution, TEMPO undergoes rapid rotational diffusion, leading to broad EPR spectra. However, as the concentration of TEMPO increases, the molecules become more crowded and their rotation becomes hindered. As a result, the tumbling motion of the TEMPO molecules decreases, causing the EPR lines to narrow. Therefore, it's expected that a less concentrated solution would show broader EPR lines than a more concentrated one.\n\nOption A is incorrect because dipole-dipole interactions between TEMPO molecules are not strong enough to significantly affect the EPR spectrum. Option C is also incorrect because hyperfine interactions occur between the electron spins and the nuclei in the vicinity, but they do not cause line broadening. Finally, option D is incorrect because exchange interactions arise from the spin-dependent electrostatic potential created by nearby paramagnetic centers, which does not seem to play a significant role in this context.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA 1 M solution of TEMPO in chloroform at room temperature shows broader EPR spectrum than that of a 1 mM solution.
