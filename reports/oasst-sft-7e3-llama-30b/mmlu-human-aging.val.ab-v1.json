Some scientists believe that weight loss may help lengthen these protective DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes.\n\nTelomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences that function to protect the ends of linear chromosomes from deterioration or from fusion with neighboring chromosomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that shortened telomeres are a marker of biological aging in many human tissues. In humans, mean leukocyte telomere length declines approximately 100 base pairs each decade of life, starting from about 7,900 bp at birth, and those who live to be 90 years old have telomeres that are slightly less than 4,000 bases long. Telomerase adds TTAGGG3 repeats to the end of lagging strands during semiconservative replication and it also can elongate them after they have been made. Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is a non-coding RNA transcript expressed specifically in the nucleus from double-stranded telomeric DNAs. It plays important roles in telomeres' maintenance. If there is enough damage or error correction fails, then cells undergo apoptosis. Critically short telomeres ultimately lead to cellular senescence, which contributes to organismal aging.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nSome recent work has found an association between obesity and\nA) Skin cancers\nB) Excess alcohol use\nC) Shorter telomere strands\nD) Tobacco use", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 04:10:20.884908+00:00"}
