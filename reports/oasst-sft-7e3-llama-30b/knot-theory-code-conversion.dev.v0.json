A prime knot is a closed loop of edges that meet at vertices where three or more strands intersect. In this case there are 13 vertices and 12 edges which makes it a very simple example. To convert from Gauss Code to Dowker-Thistlethwaite code you would need to perform a sequence of moves on each edge of the knot as described below:\n* Move along the edge until you reach the first crossing.\n* At the crossing look to see if the top strand goes over (1) or under (−1) the bottom strand. If it goes over record 1, if it goes under record −1.\n* After one crossing move along the top strand until you find another crossing. Repeat step two for this crossing.\n* Continue moving along the top strand making note of every time it crosses over or under another strand, noting the sign (+/-) of each intersection until you return to your starting point (the vertex). Here end of this edge has been reached.\n* Perform steps 2–5 for all other edges of the knot.\n\nThe resulting list of signs (+/-) is your Gauss Code. You can then use an algorithm such as the Alexander Polynomial or Jones Matrix to compute the corresponding knot polynomial, V(t), where t=−1 is the unknot. Or, alternatively, you could manually transform the Gauss Code into the Tables of Prime and Composite Knots looking for a match. If the transformation results in a composite knot you may have accidentally introduced Torsion (a twisted component) during construction of your prime knot. If so simply undo any twists and try again.\n\nA quick inspection of the tables shows us that our knot is none other than the \"T", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Convert the knots represented in their gauss code, to Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
