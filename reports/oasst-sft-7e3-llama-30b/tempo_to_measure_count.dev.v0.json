This is because each measure in 4/4 has 4 beats rather than 2 like 2/2. So e.g., the eight notes will last one beat, whereas the sixteenth notes will last 0.5 beats. Thus the calculation becomes:\n(1+1+1+1) + ((2*(0.5))+(0.5)+(2)*(0."}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 03:42:07.962038+00:00"}
