However, their level of detail could have been improved by providing more information about the different factors that influence the estimated range of words spoken daily on Earth.\n\nAssistant 2 also provided a helpful, relevant, and accurate answer that used some reasonable assumptions to estimate the number of words spoken daily on Earth. They also mentioned the limitations of their estimation method which was a plus. However, their level of detail could have been improved by providing more information about the factors that affect the estimated global average of words spoken per person.\n\nOverall, both assistants provided reasonably good answers with some strengths and weaknesses.
