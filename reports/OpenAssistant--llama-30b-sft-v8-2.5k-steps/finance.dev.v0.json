Using the formula for compound interest, we can calculate the amount of interest as follows:\n\nInterest = A x R x T / 365\n\nWhere A = the account balance, R = the annual interest rate, and T = the time in years.\n\nIn this case, A = $10,674.21, R = 21.99%, and T = 6/365. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nInterest = ($10,674.21 * 21.99%) x 6/365 = $27.27\n\nSo between February 12th and February 18th, Jason was charged $27.27 in interest. Moving forward to March 10th (a total of 21 days after February 18th), we need to consider both the interest accrued during the remaining days in February and the interest accrued during the entire month of March.\n\nUsing the same formula, we can calculate the interest for the remaining days in February:\n\nFebruary Interest = ($10,674.21 * 21.99%) x (21 - 6) / 365 = $46.54\n\nThen, to calculate the interest for the entire month of March, we assume that the average daily balance is equal to the beginning balance plus any new purchases minus the payment already"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-17 09:19:23.080820+00:00"}
