The purpose of the function is to compute the remainder when {n} modulo {p} is computed.

This can range from 1 to 10000, as long as it is less than the value of the <code>p</code> parameter (which is 101 by default).\n- <code>p</code> represents the base that the numbers are being calculated in.\n\nTests:\n\n- When <code>{n: int} = 0</code> and <code>{p: int} = 3</code>, the result should be 1 and the error should be \"Incorrect operands to bitwise or\", respectively. This is because the <code>{p: int}</code> value of 3 is a divisor of 3. However, the <code>modp</code> function is designed to compute the remainder of numbers with odd values. If you want to get the remainder of the number n for an odd input p, the value of {n: int} should be 1 (or a different value in some cases).\n- When <code>{n: int} &gt;= p+1</code> and <code>{p: int} = 101</code>, the result should be 8 (or 9 if 101 is divisible by 9).
