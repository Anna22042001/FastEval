This will give you incorrect characters if your alphabet contains non-ASCII characters.\n- You don't handle case properly (e.g. \"A\" vs \"a\"). You can either convert all letters to upperCase first, then perform the operation, or add an extra check before iterating over the list.\n- You are not handling errors correctly; currently, if there is an error while encoding, nothing will be returned.
