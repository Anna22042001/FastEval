It plays with the expectation set up by the beginning of the sentence and subverts it. This kind of setup-and-payoff structure can often lead to laughter.\n\nThe second joke about the pineapple being upset when it meets an apple because it hears that apples don't grow on trees, but this one does, also uses a similar type of unexpected twist. By setting up a common misconception about apples growing on trees, the punchline challenges that assumption and creates surprise. Surprise can sometimes trigger laughter.\n\nThat said, whether someone will find these jokes actually funny depends on their personal sense of humor, cultural background, and individual experiences. Humor is highly subjective and differs greatly between individuals and groups. Ultimately, both jokes use playful language and wordplay to create unexpected moments that some people might find amusing.\n\nTo sum it up, both jokes have elements that could make them funny for some people but ultimately depend on individual taste and context. Based on my analysis and understanding of humor, I believe they could score around a 3 on the scale of 1 to 5 for humor.
