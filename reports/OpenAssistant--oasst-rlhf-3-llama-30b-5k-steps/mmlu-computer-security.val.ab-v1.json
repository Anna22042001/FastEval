However, in some cases, a malicious attacker may be able to intercept or bypass SMS messages and gain unauthorized access to an account.\nOn the other hand, while U2F keys are designed to resist various types of attacks, including those carried out by malicious hackers who have obtained a user's password, they are not foolproof.

The attacker might hope to pass off their tampered version as authentic so this approach might provide some level of 'integrity assurance' at least in certain scenarios. This also indirectly involves violating the integrity via replacement, so perhaps option B is arguably valid after all.\n\nC) Option C - \"Overview\" may be inferred somewhat if an attacker tries to modify the file/message beyond what it was designed to handle i.e. corrupting it by changing more than permitted, then recomputing the hash value hoping that it still matches.

For example, if they discover that adding whitespace to text changes nothing in terms of the final hash, then even small modifications become possible without detection depending on how the algorithm behaves. However, in most cases we wouldn't consider simple overwriting or erasure-based attacks as covered by this option because these don't really change anything about the integrity checking mechanism itself but simply undermine its usefulness.

This means that if all of these conditions hold (the client didn't send a cert, they're both honest and non-leaky, etc), then TLS would protect against an attacker breaking in to a CA and creating a fake cert for the server. It also would defend against an attacker stealing the real server cert, since no such thing happened in this scenario. However, it doesn't do anything about MITM attacks where someone intercepts traffic on either end; the two sides still have to somehow figure out whether each other are who they claim to be before doing anything important or secret over this secure channel. That might happen through some out-of-band mechanism (e.g., clicking \"accept\" on a website you trust), though! And there's more research on using crypto techniques like authenticated delivery guarantees as part of building systems that can resist MitM even when the network is totally hostile, so maybe we could imagine something else too. But right now, classical public-key crypto systems like what TLS uses mostly only prevent eavesdropping and certain kinds of impersonation/forgery by a malicious third party -- i.e., classic Man In The Middle attacks. They don't address a lot of other possible ways adversaries could mess things up, which motivates lots more work across computer science around making security mechanisms stronger, better integrated into complex systems, easier to use correctly while avoiding common mistakes, and so forth. There are many different problems and challenges here, requiring expertise from people trained in various areas of math/computer science/engineering/social sciences and more... but hopefully this gives a glimpse at how one specific property of TLS fits into a larger context where progress requires interdisciplinary collaboration drawing upon many fields!
