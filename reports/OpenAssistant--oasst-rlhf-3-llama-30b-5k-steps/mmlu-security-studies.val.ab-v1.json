A) Through a combination of military and economic measures that secure the state's position as the leader in a competitive international system.\n\nThis statement accurately reflects Waltz's neorealist theory on international relations. In his book \"Theory of International Relations,\" Waltz argues that states aim to increase their own security by acquiring more power relative to other states in the international system. This can be achieved through both military and economic means, such as building up armed forces, increasing economic wealth, and forming alliances with other powerful states. The ultimate goal for many states is to become the dominant hegemon in the international system, securing their own survival and preventing challenges from rival powers. However, this strategy also leads to competition among great powers and creates conditions for conflict. Therefore, while being powerful may provide some degree of security, it does not guarantee peaceful relations between states. Other factors like shared interests, diplomacy, and institutions can help mitigate tensions and promote cooperation, but ultimately the distribution of power remains a key factor shaping international politics. So yes, having greater power compared to others increases one's chances of achieving security in the dangerous world of international relations. But this comes at a cost: encouraging arms races, instability, and sometimes even war if great power dynamics shift too dramatically. While it has its advantages, relying solely on military might to ensure national security is neither desirable nor sustainable given the risks involved.

'Security seeker' states are those that only want to be secure in the status quo, although they might get drawn into arms races and war because of structural pressures in the anarchic international system. (From Introduction to International Relations by Ciaran Walsh.)\n\nTherefore, according to Ciaran Walsh, there are two types of states: 'Greedy States' who always want more power, territory or wealth and Security Seeker States who only want to be safe from attack by others but will engage in conflict if threatened by another state. This theory has its roots in Morgenthau realism; it also explains why democracies do not fight each other - because they don't have anything to gain!\nThe three main assumptions underpinning Greedy State Theory are as follows:\n1) All nation-states operate within an anarchical system where there exists no higher authority able to resolve conflicts (i.e., wars can occur);\n2) Nation-state leaders strive for self-preservation via acquiring additional material possessions such as territory, natural resources, capital and population;\n3) Conflicts arise due to competition over these material goods.\n\nIf you would like me to elaborate on one of these statements or explain them in further detail feel free to ask and I shall attempt to respond appropriately! To learn more about different theories in IR, including liberalism, constructivism, critical theory, postmodernism, etc, please let me know too as it may help frame future answers. If instead you would like me to expand upon Greedy State Theory itself and/or provide some example cases then just say so! Hope this helps :)", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhat are the differences between 'greedy state' and 'security seeker' states?\nA) There is no difference, the terms are synonymous.\nB) 'Greedy' states are those that seek to advance their power through territorial expansion, even when they are already secure in the status quo. 'Security seeker' states are those that only want to be secure in the status quo, although they might get drawn into arms races and war because of structural pressures in the anarchic international system.\nC) 'Greedy states' seek territorial expansion as a result of pressures created by the international system. The anarchic nature of the international system makes states insecure, and greedy states seek to rectify this by any means necessary. 'Security seekers' on the other hand are those already secure in the status quo.\nD) 'Security seeker' states are those interested in achieving security in the international system, whilst 'greedy states' are interested only in amassing power, land, and other resources.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 04:58:24.565094+00:00"}

As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.\nB) While the CWC has been ratified by the majority of international society, some nations with a large chemical capability at their disposal have yet to enter into the treaty. However, to some analysts the destructive military potential would be limited, having a moderate effect on a well-equipped army in conventional warfare. Chemical arsenal essentially falls under the category of the \"poor mans\" weaponry, being simplistic and inexpensive whilst having limited military utility. However, the concern remains of the prospective impact a terrorist chemical attack could have on civilian populations.\nC) The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.\nD) The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles.
