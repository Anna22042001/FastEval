Therefore, over 20 days she pays `20 * 0.37` = `$7.4`.\n\nSince Sarah has already paid $125 towards her credit card bill, this reduces the balance that accumulates interest.

The total amount of interest that Sarah has been charged is therefore $7.4 on top of the remaining balance of $1112.42, so the total amount of interest that she will be charged by the 15th of October is $1112.42 + $7.4 = $<<1112.42+7.4=1120>>1120.00.
