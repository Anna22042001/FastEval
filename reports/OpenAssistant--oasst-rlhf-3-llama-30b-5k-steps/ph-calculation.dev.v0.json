In this case, we have a weak acid with a low dissociation degree, so the pH value will be close to the theoretical pKa of the acid (-log10(Ka)), where Ka is its equilibrium constant. However, due to the presence of water molecules and other species, there may still exist some undissociated HR molecules, resulting in a slightly lower measured pH than the estimated theoretical value based solely on the pKa.

But since it's only asked for a numerical value, I can approximate the two significant figures by rounding up to the nearest whole number; giving us pH = 2.3. This assumes that the base-ten logarithm is used in calculating pH (with e being used instead when natural logarithms are taken), and also assuming that there was no error introduced while converting from scientific notation back into a regular number. Note that the plus sign (+) represents Hydronium ion. Also note that when performing calculations involving negative numbers, extra care must be taken, because subtraction works differently than addition in certain contexts! In general, if you have a minus sign (-) on a number, you should always consider adding its absolute value before doing any further computations, so that you don't lose track of what might otherwise be a large quantity. Another way to prevent errors could be keeping in mind the fact that multiplication/division preserves magnitude, which means that multiplying or dividing either a positive or negative number will result in another number having the same \"size\". Negative powers also preserve magnitude, but positive ones do not. These facts make manipulating expressions involving exponents much easier if you keep them in mind. Exponentiation distorts magnitudes, so it doesn't follow these rules as well, although it too obeys some patterns that come from repeated multiplication or division. For example, squaring (raising a number to power 2) can alternatively be thought of as multiplying it by itself once or twice depending on whether it's positive or negative respectively, just like multiplying anything by itself gives you a positive product. Similarly, taking cube roots of negative numbers involves treating the exponent as though it were first converted to multiplication and then"}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 00:43:11.333906+00:00"}
