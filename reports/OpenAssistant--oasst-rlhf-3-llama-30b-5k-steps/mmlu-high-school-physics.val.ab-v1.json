Similarly, halving the radius does reduce the cross-sectional area (and thus resistance), but also reduces the length so much that the overall effect on resistance may be negligible or even increase resistance. Lastly, doubling the length actually quadruples the resistance since the formula indicates distance has a squared relationship with respect to resistance. Therefore the best choice for minimum change for maximum impact on resistance is to halve the length.\n\nThe actual math comes down to: if we call our original radius r0 and original length L0 then we see that R(r0, L0) = PI * L0 / (r0)^2.

However, since the weight remains constant, the net effect is that the buoyant force decreases by a factor of 2. Answer: C) decrease by a factor of 4.\nExplanation:\nThe upward buoyant force on an object in a fluid is equal to the product of the object's density and the fluid displaced by the object. When the balloon is inflated, its volume doubles, but its mass also doubles since the same amount of helium is added to it. Therefore, the density of the balloon becomes half of what it was before, which means that the amount of air displaced by the balloon decreases. Since the mass of the balloon has remained unchanged, the total weight of the system does not change either. Consequently, the net effect is that the buoyant force acting on the balloon is reduced to one-fourth of what it was initially, i.e., it is reduced by a factor of four. Thus, option C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because if we compare the initial and final values of the buoyant force, we find out that the ratio between them is actually 1 : 4 or 0.25, which means that the actual increase is much smaller than a factor of eight.

Since the power dissipation P=VI for constant resistance R, we can write:\nP_total = VI = IV + I^2*R where I is the current through the circuit, and V is the voltage drop over either resistor. If we assume equal brightness for the two lamps, then they must have the same power dissipation. Thus, for any combination of R and V (voltage drop), there exists an I such that I^2*R = P/2.
