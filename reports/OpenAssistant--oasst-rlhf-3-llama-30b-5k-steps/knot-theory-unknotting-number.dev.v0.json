This cannot be done if there are multiple distinct Knots or Links present - as in the case here where there are three separate closed loops with intersections between them at various places along their length. Each loop would need to have it's own unknotting process performed on it separately in order determine the unknotting numbers of each component of the larger linked structure. However since these loops share crossings with other loops they may become tangled in ways which prevent a simple determination of any U(n) values unless special methods tailored to dealing with composite structures are employed.

This means that it takes 18 crossing changes to transform this knot into the unknotted circle. Note that negative values represent non-alternating knots and are counted as half their absolute value towards unknotting (e.g., an odd negative number represents a knot with one less twist than the same positive integer). In this case, all knots except for the last two have an even number of crossings, so they require the full amount of their crossing number to become unknotted. However, the last two knots are alternating, which allows us to count them as if they had twice the number of crossings due to their mirror symmetry about the center line. Thus, we divide their actual crossing numbers by 2 to find the true minimum number of moves required to reach the unknotted state. For example, (-24) / 2 = -12 is considered worse than (-22) / 2 = -11, because although both need 12 moves each to become untangled, (-22) requires fewer overall moves than (-24). Finally, (-20) also needs 12 moves but has more overall moves than either of its neighbors due to having 20 instead of 22 or 24 total crossings. Therefore, (-14) > (-20), meaning that these three knots go from best to worst in terms of ease of untying: (-14), (-22), (-12). Since (-12) is smaller than (-14), we know that (2) would be better still since it has the smallest positive value and must therefore beat all other alternating candidates.

To see this, note that its Dowker-Thistlethwaite code can be simplified to $T(3,-2)$, which represents a trefoil knot with one positive and two negative crossings. Since a trefoil has unknotting number 1, so does any knot equivalent to it under orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the plane, such as $K$. The same argument shows that the unknotting number of $K$ cannot be greater than 1; if there were an unknotting operation on $K$, we could apply it to $T(3,-2)$ to obtain the trivial knot, but clearly no unknotting of $T(3,-2)$ can result in the identity. Thus, the unknotting number of $K$ must equal 1.\n\nIn general, since $D_n \\cong T(-2, -n+1) \\# T(2, n-1)$ for all odd integers $n > 1$, where $\\#$ denotes connected sum, the unknotting numbers of these Dowker-Thistlethwaite codes are related by $u(D_n) = u(T(-2, -n + 1)) + u(T(2,n - 1)) - 1$. For example, since $T(2,n - 1)$ is the $(n - 2)$--torus knot and thus has unknotting number at least 2 (and sometimes higher), while $T(-2, -n + 1)$ is obtained from $T(2,n - 1)$ via orientation reversal, we conclude that $u(D_n) \\ge n - 1$. In fact, equality occurs when $n$ is prime", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "Determine the unknotting number of the knot, represented in Dowker-Thistlethwaite code.
