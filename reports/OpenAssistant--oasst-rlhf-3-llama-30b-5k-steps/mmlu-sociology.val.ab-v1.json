The view of anti-psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz and R.D. Laing was that mental illness was a set of deviant behaviors resulting from individuals being out of touch with reality or incapable of making sense of their experiences. Anti-psychiatry views psychiatric treatment as violating individual rights to autonomy and self-determination because it typically involves compulsory confinement and forced medication, even though most recipients consider this an unpleasant but necessary evil given they have limited capacity to make decisions. This movement gained popularity during the 1960s–70s, advocates for deinstitutionalization were concerned about social control more than patient care, whereas now these concerns are not seen so much as motivators, since Western society has moved on from the total institutions of the past to modern therapeutic communities where patients feel safer and more respected (e.g., advanced forms of occupational therapy). In addition, the medical model, with its reliance on diagnostic labels for understanding distress or unusual behaviour, remains dominant, despite several critiques. As such, anti-psychiatry can be understood as a response to perceived abuses of power by psychiatrists and also as a way of criticising the bio-medical/genetic model dominance of contemporary Western cultures. However, anti-psychiatrists are accused of exaggerating the effects of pharmaceutical companies over prescribing doctors.

Sociology is widely regarded as one of many social sciences. The field of sociology uses the scientific method to test hypotheses about how human behavior operates on both micro (face-to-face interaction between individuals) and macro levels (large groups). In fact, much of what we know today about topics like race relations and gender comes from studies conducted using the scientific method in the field of sociology. Finally, while there certainly are some political aspects involved when it comes to deciding which projects receive funding, this hardly means that scientists have given up objectivity for ideological reasons - there are plenty of areas where scientists agree across ideological boundaries (evolution denial, anti-vaxxers, climate change skeptics), so your claim simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny. At any rate, even if you assume the worst - that most sociologists are leftist activists engaged in \"propaganda\" rather than real scholarship, their work still would have been subjected to rigorous peer review. So while individual papers may contain ideological bias or bad faith arguments, the entire process leading to publication remains objective.\n\nFinally, let me briefly address another point you raised earlier regarding whether there are \"facts\" to study at all in sociology beyond statistics and correlations. While it is true that correlation does not imply causation, that doesn't mean that there aren't underlying causes driving those correlations. For example, take the issue of racism and police violence against minorities in America. It might be easy enough to demonstrate statistically through various methods that such violence disproportionately affects certain racial communities more than others.

In short, biopower involves managing whole populations, usually in nation states but also sometimes globally or locally through NGOs like the Red Cross or Greenpeace. This differs from simply maintaining order over individuals (such as through policing or prisons); rather than discipline people one at a time, biopower seeks to control entire populations through statistical knowledge about them.
