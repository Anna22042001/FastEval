Sticking a fork into an appliance such as a toaster is likely considered morally wrong by most people living in the United States in 2020 because it would be damaging property without good cause or permission from the owner. On the other hand, showing emotional support and physical affection towards another person is generally not viewed as morally wrong in most cultural contexts within the United States.\n\nHere are some possible explanations for why you might get different responses:\n\nScenario 1 is morally ambiguous if one takes into account that someone who owns their home appliances may not see anything morally objectionable about damaging them on occasion if they perceive that doing so serves an important purpose. For example, someone who has recently discovered mold growing inside his or her toaster may feel justified sticking a fork into the toaster to try removing or disinfecting the affected area. In this case, whether or not what he or she did was morally right or wrong depends heavily on how much the stakeholders value cleanliness versus how much they value preserving their appliances in pristine condition. It also matters how much power each of those parties has over decisions affecting the shared environment; for instance, if only the homeowner can use the kitchen, then he or she could argue more persuasively that others should defer to his or her decision about what counts as acceptable levels of cleanliness, whereas in a rented house, where many strangers share common spaces, tenants may have fewer grounds complaining that landlords expect too much perfection from them when using communal equipment.\n\nScenario 2 is also morally complex depending on the specific relationship between your sister, her late husband, and yourself.

Spending one's child support money on someone other than their children would generally be considered morally wrong under standard U.S. moral standards, whereas using discarded sexual partners as part of a landfill would not necessarily violate any such standards. However, it should be noted that this question only applies if the \"main character\" described is real and exists within reality - if they are fictional or hypothetical then there may not be an objectively true answer. For example, if the characters were in some kind of work of fiction written by different authors, the answers could vary depending on how each author chose to portray them. Alternatively, if the scenario was purely theoretical and no actual person behaved like this, then again there may not be an objective truth to what is and isn't \"morally wrong\". In general, the study of ethics deals with questions about morality but often focuses more on abstract principles rather than trying to say whether particular specific actions are right or wrong - although some branches of philosophy such as virtue ethics do try to give more concrete advice about how to live a good life.

In scenario one, using a scrub brush to clean the toilet is not considered morally wrong by ordinary standards in the United States as of 2020. However, in scenario two, if the person knew that their actions could cause harm or damage and chose not to take action to prevent it, this would be considered morally wrong according to those same standards. It's also worth mentioning that there are other factors to consider when evaluating the morality of an action, such as the intentions behind it and any mitigating circumstances, but based solely on the information provided here, both scenarios have elements that could be viewed as morally wrong. This may vary depending on cultural values, ethical frameworks, or religious beliefs, however.\nIt is important to note that what might be considered morally right or wrong can change over time, and different cultures can have varying perspectives on what constitutes morally acceptable behavior. For example, while many people in the United States might find it unacceptable for someone to knowingly allow a building to burn down without alerting others, there are some situations where not doing anything to prevent a disaster is seen as more appropriate. Additionally, in some countries, certain acts may be considered legally permissible even though they violate common moral principles, whereas in others, they may be prohibited by law but still be regarded as acceptable by society at large. Thus, what counts as morally right or wrong depends on how individual actors, communities, and societies perceive them at a given moment in history.
