The values for each population can be obtained using the Boltzmann distribution formula. Therefore, we need to know how to calculate the polarization of a nucleus or an electron in a magnetic field to solve this question correctly. In addition, you also need to use the value of the nuclear magneton to convert from tesla to webers per square meter. And take into account the temperature effect on the nuclear spins population, that's why the answer contains two different temperatures.\n\nHere are some additional information about this topic:\nThe nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), commonly used in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, relies upon the interaction between a paramagnetic metal ion, such as Mn2+, Cu2+, or Co2+, and nearby nuclear spins. This phenomenon arises due to the presence of unpaired electrons in these ions, which carry a localized negative charge density that perturbs the electronic environment around neighboring nuclei. NOEs have been observed under various circumstances including both liquid and solid states [1]. By examining many aspects of NOE through theoretical, computational, experimental, and analytical approaches, scientists are able to gain more insight into its underlying physics. Additionally, this technique has contributed significantly towards understanding other related topics like hyperpolarizability, magnetic shielding, exchange interactions, chemical reactivity, and photochemistry.

This can occur due to differences in the local magnetic field experienced by each spin or due to motional averaging caused by fast rotation of the spins. The observation of a broader EPR spectrum for a 1 mM solution of TEMPO compared to a 1 M solution is likely due to the slower rotational dynamics of the TEMPO molecules in the more concentrated solution, resulting in increased motionally-averaged linewidths. Option A is incorrect because dipole-dipole interactions between the TEMPO molecules would result in splitting rather than broadening of the EPR lines.
