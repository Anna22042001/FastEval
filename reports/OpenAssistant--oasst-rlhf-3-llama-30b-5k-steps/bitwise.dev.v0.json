The `bin()` function simply takes an integer argument and returns it as a binary string, while the `dec()` function converts a given binary string to its decimal equivalent. Both functions use Python's built-in `bin()` and `int()` functions for their respective conversions.\n\nNext, we can write a simple recursive algorithm to convert a decimal number into its equivalent binary string:\n\n1. If the decimal number is negative, return \"0b-\" followed by the result of calling `binary_str()` recursively on -number itself.\n2. If the decimal number has more digits than needed for its binary representation (i.e., ceil(log2(number))), pad the left side of the resulting binary string with extra zeros until it reaches this length.
