Removing an element takes O(n) time on average, although it can be done in amortized constant time if the tree rotations are accounted properly. Since we need to first find the node to be removed by searching through the entire structure before actually removing it from the tree, this step also contributes O(n) steps overall leading to an O(n) time complexity for the removal operation. If you're interested in more details about why AVL trees have O(n) worst-case remove time complexity, let me know! Also note that while heaps and unsorted arrays will have poorer performance than either binary search trees or sorted arrays, they still do support efficient insertion/removal of elements as well as efficient retrieval of elements ordered according to their keys (either values themselves or hashes of strings etc.). Heaps allow efficient access to lowest values while unordered arrays might be faster for numerical algorithms where sorting isn't necessary but random access is. Let me know if there are any other questions related to data structures / algorithms you want help understanding better! Some examples include: - Tradeoffs between different data structures for specific problems like priority queues or associative arrays  - Understanding when recursive solutions lead to exponential blowup vs linear time algorithms  - Explaining dynamic programming or greedy approaches used to solve certain optimization problems etc. Basically anything else you may be curious about from your studies so far!
