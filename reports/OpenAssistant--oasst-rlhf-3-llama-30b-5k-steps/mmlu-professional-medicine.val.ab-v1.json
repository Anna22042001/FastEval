This means that there may be other factors associated with the choice of treatment that could also influence outcomes, such as comorbidities or compliance with medication regimens. As a result, this could lead to an overestimation of the differences between the two treatments. Therefore, type II errors occur when researchers fail to find statistical significance when an effect truly exists, which would mean that the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between the treatments) is falsely accepted. In this case, since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new drug has a higher incidence of fatigue compared to conventional treatment, but still suffer from type II error if the real difference is larger than what they found, even though their finding is statistically significant already. To avoid type II errors, researchers need to increase their sample size, lower alpha level, or both to detect smaller differences more effectively.\n\nType I error occurs when researchers incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. This usually happens when there isn’t any true difference between groups, yet researchers think there is one due to chance variability among samples. We use alpha levels such as 0.05 or 0.01 to determine how much we trust our measurements or assumptions before making decisions like “we don’t believe it’s random variation anymore.” If there is really no difference between two conditions, the actual probability of getting these test statistics is low. However, researchers must make sure to keep their alpha levels within acceptable bounds such as 0.05. By doing so, they might accidentally reject the null hypothesis despite the absence of the true differences between groups", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nA cohort study is conducted to compare the incidence of adverse effects of a recently approved antihypertensive pharmacotherapy with that of conventional therapy. A total of 20,000 patients are enrolled. Twelve thousand are prescribed the recently approved therapy, and 8,000 are prescribed conventional therapy. Patients in the study and control groups are matched for baseline blood pressure, age, and gender. Data are collected from the records of the patients' ongoing clinical care. Results show that those receiving the newly approved treatment have twice the incidence of fatigue compared with those receiving the conventional treatment.
