It is a play on words and a clever way of expressing that the relationship between the mango and banana has ended, which can be considered humorous. The phrase 'it just wasn't a-peeling anymore!' is an example of a pun because it sounds like 'it just wasn't appealing anymore', but instead means that the skin of the fruit was not coming off easily. This type of wordplay relies on the listener understanding the double meaning behind the phrase and recognizing how it is being used in this context. Humor often involves unexpected twists or surprises, so when something catches us off guard in a creative or lighthearted way, we may find it amusing. In this case, the use of a pun related to fruits creates a moment of surprise and can elicit laughter as a result. Additionally, humor also depends on individual preferences, culture, and personal experiences; what one person finds hilarious might not have the same effect on someone else. So while some people may find this joke very funny, others may only find it somewhat amusing or not funny at all. Ultimately, whether or not something is perceived as funny can depend on many factors beyond its objective quality. Overall, the success of a joke often comes down to subjective interpretation and response rather than any inherent property of the material itself. Regardless of whether someone finds this specific joke funny, jokes in general are a common tool for building camaraderie, diffusing tension, or simply adding levity to a situation by poking fun at ourselves and our world. They allow us to see things in a different light or approach life with more whimsy, which can be refreshing even if it doesn't always make us burst out laughing.

Additionally, there are different types of comedy such as sarcasm and irony, and while this statement doesn't contain any of those elements, it doesn't make it unfunny either.
