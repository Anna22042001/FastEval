In this case, it looks like \"Player Y\" has won because all of their pieces have been placed horizontally across the board, whereas Player X's pieces are scattered throughout the board without any clear pattern of winning moves. However, there could be different interpretations depending on how you define \"winning\".\nIn general, a good way to implement your own version of a simple game would be to specify an initial set of rules for how players take turns making moves (e.g., who goes first, what each player can do on their turn), and then use those rules to evaluate whether anyone has won after all possible moves have been made. For example, in Connect-4, a common rule might be that Players alternate taking turns dropping their piece into one of two columns until someone gets four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Then the game ends immediately with no more moves being allowed.
