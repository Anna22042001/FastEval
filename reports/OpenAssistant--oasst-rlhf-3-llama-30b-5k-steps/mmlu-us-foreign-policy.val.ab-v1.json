There are many different views regarding who was responsible for starting the Cold War or whether it could have been avoided so a definitive answer will always be debatable.\n\nAdditionally note that some revisionist perspectives also include more than one option from those provided here in their reasoning. For example both B and C may apply together if you view domestic pressure as causing action but not necessarily conflict.

Some may say that the threat posed by the Soviet union created such domestic pressures or visa versa etc... So these nuanced discussions can go on forever and ever!

There was a power vacuum left by WWII in Europe that allowed the Soviets to expand their influence while also exacerbating ideological differences between them and the West. In addition, the expansionist nature of the Soviet Union played a significant role in contributing to tensions during this time period, particularly as they took control of Eastern European nations following the war. Although there were certainly other factors at play such as economic competition and military buildups, it can be argued that these two elements above all else led to the beginning stages of the Cold War conflict. It is important to note though, that although Realism emphasizes anarchy (or lack of international government), self-help (rather than relying on others for security or prosperity), and states' inherent competitiveness, these factors need not always lead directly into armed conflicts necessarily. Nonetheless, given enough time under those conditions (anarchic environment, suspicion, distrust), it becomes more likely rather than less likely. Thus, even if you accept that both statements (a and b) may not have been equally causal, together they form a strong case for realist explanations regarding why war might have broken out between Capitalist/Western powers vs. Socialist/Soviet ones during the mid-20th century especially when coupled with nuclear weapons which made mutually assured destruction a reality as well-- another key aspect highlighted within realism: fear/balance of force considerations.)
