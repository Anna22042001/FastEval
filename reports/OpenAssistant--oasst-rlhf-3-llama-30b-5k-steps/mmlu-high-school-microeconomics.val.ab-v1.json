Thus, the term \"diminishing marginal utility\" accurately describes the relationship between increasing prices and decreasing utility for consumers when it comes to certain goods. The other options do not describe the same relationship.\n\n1. DIMINISHING MARGINAL UTILITY: When you buy something useful in daily life such as fruits, vegetables, milk etc., your happiness or satisfaction after buying them remains unchanged until they get spoiled or get rotten. For example, if you bought apples yesterday at $2 per kg and today again you purchase apples at the same rate; then it does not give extra happiness or satisfaction to you because you already had these yesterday so their marginal utility has diminished. Another day, if you buy apples at $4 per kg, even though you might feel happy about having more number of apples but still their average utility would be less than what you got by spending $2 per kg. Similarly, if I go on buying more and more apples at higher rates my total utilities would keep on reducing. So, law of diminishing marginal utility states that if we take successive units of a commodity, the additional satisfaction derived from each subsequent unit goes on diminishing.

Efficiency depends on various factors such as the number of firms, degree of collusion, barriers to entry, etc. Hence, statement C is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option D: \"The value placed on the product by the buyer is equal to the cost of production of the seller at the margin of an additional sale.\" is the correct answer. At the point of long-run equilibrium in perfect competition, the price (P) charged by producers equals their marginal cost (MC), while buyers are willing to pay this same amount (P) for the product. In other words, the value placed on the product by the buyer is equal to its cost of production at the margin, ensuring an allocation of resources that maximizes social welfare.", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhen marginal cost equals price in a perfectly competitive product market at long run equilibrium, which of the following is NOT correct?\nA) There is a socially optimal or efficient output and price.\nB) It is a sign of high concentration among sellers.\nC) Other product markets are inefficient by contrast.\nD) The value placed on the product by the buyer is equal to the cost of production of the seller at the margin of an additional sale.", "options": ["B"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:43:34.369375+00:00"}

The government could take various actions such as imposing taxes or regulations on the steel industry. These actions would reduce the supply of steel in the market and lead to a decrease in its price.
