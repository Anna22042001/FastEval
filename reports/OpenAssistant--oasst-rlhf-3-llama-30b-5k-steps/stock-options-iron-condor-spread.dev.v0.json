If you sell a put option with a strike price of $42, then the maximum loss would occur if the stock price goes to zero (i.e., bankruptcy). In this case, you would have to buy the stock at $42 per share (the strike price), but it's worthless, so your loss would be equal to $42 x 100 = $<<42*100=4200>>4200. Since you received $1.28 per share ($1.28 x 100 = $<<1.28*100=128>>128) for selling the put options, your net breakeven stock price would be $42 - $1.28 = $<<42-1.28=-40.72>>-40.72. This means that as long as the stock price is above this level, you will make a profit on the trade.\n\nThe break even stock prices for the other positions can be calculated similarly. The difference between these break even prices and the previous position reflects the time premium paid/received for each option.\n\nFor the second put option, we need to find the minimum possible outcome for the stock price.
