The only way to get across is with a boat that they find on one side; but that boat can only take one person at a time. The boat cannot return on its own, and there are no ropes to haul it back, yet both persons manage to cross using the boat. How did they do it?\n************\n[Expert]: The people are on different sides of the river, so the person on the same side as the boat originally can cross first to bring the boat to the side with the other person, then that person can cross.\n************\n[Submission]: They used stones or rocks in order for one of them to be able to go back once he had crossed over to where the other was standing before! \nThis is because when you throw a rock into a lake you can then hear the sound of the splash of the rock hitting the water and bouncing around the shore. And as long as the stone has not sunk down into mud/sand at the bottom you may even retrieve the same stone again by following these sounds to their source: the location of the stone. This means that you could potentially make two trips without returning to the original position! You just have to remember exactly what path to follow in order to avoid getting lost! As soon as you arrive near your destination you also should mark your route so that you will know how to come back later (for example by breaking off twigs from trees and bushes). The second trip might look something like this: the first person takes the boat to the other side while the second remains behind. He throws a stone towards his friend who picks it up and makes sure to memorize the place and surroundings so that he would recognize it later. Then the first returns and takes the boat back to where the third is waiting. With another stone the same process is repeated except now our friend does not need to memorize anything new since he already knows the way along the banks from the previous attempt. Instead he focuses on marking the trail back with broken twigs etc. While he waits the first person throws more stones into the river until such point when they land close enough together for him to try to swim across. When all three finally reach the other bank he throws away some of those stones so that nobody else would discover the secret hidden here... Just think about it - perhaps this method can help to solve other riddles too?\n************\n[END DATA]\n\nCompare the factual content of the submitted answer with the expert answer.

It states that \"today it's [Chris'] birthday again!\" This suggests that there have been two consecutive birthdays for Chris - one yesterday (December 31), and another today (January 1). This contradicts the initial premise that today is actually Chris' birthday.\n2. The math provided in the second part of the answer doesn't make sense when compared to the problem statement. Calculating the difference between Chris' current age and the number of days ago from today (two days ago) results in 7 instead of 6.
