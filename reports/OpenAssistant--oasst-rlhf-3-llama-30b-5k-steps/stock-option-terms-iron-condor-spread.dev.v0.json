For example if the puts were purchased before the calls then it may instead represent a different trade altogether such as a long call vertical spread.

The goal is to capture the difference in premium between the two calls minus the net debit paid when entering the trade. It's also known as bullish vertical spread. In this case, it can be classified as a Bear Put Spread or Credit Spread since we have sold a put with a lower strike than the other put. However, since the overall sentiment is still bullish, I would classify it as a Bull Call Spread.\nBear Put Spread (Selling a put at a specific strike price and purchasing a put at a lower strike price) - A bear put spread is an options strategy whereby an investor holds a short position in a particular stock; he or she writes (sells) put contracts at a particular strike price and simultaneously buys put options at a lower strike price on the same stock.\nCall Backspread/Vertical Spread (Writing a call at a certain strike and simultaneously buying back a call option written earlier that has a higher strike price) - This options trading strategy is used when an options trader expects share price to fall moderately rather than sharply in future periods. Here, too much reliance should not be placed upon implied volatility rankings alone, because those are based largely on historical volatilities and could change dramatically depending on market conditions. If you think about it, most long equity positions will break even if they experience a decline in the stock price equal to their initial outlay for the position.
