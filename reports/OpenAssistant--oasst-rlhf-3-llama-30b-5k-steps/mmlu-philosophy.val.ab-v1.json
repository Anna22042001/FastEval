Aquinas believed that all human actions are ultimately directed towards achieving happiness, which is found in union with God. Thus, he argued that every agent acts for the sake of pleasing God. This idea is closely related to his concept of natural law, according to which all humans have a natural inclination to seek their own good and to follow moral rules as dictated by reason. He also believed that this tendency towards God was written on the hearts of all men by nature itself, so it's impossible not to recognize it even if one tries to deny its existence. However, some people might argue that C) self-interest could be another valid response since many actions can be seen as taken for personal advantage or gain, but this would not cover all possible cases where someone acts out of duty or simply because they see something as right thing to do regardless of any benefits that may come from it. Also D) an end doesn't fully capture the essence of Aquinas argumentation since ends are usually means to achieve something else while goals themselves are only worthwhile when chosen for the sake of proper reasons (i.e. because we believe them to be morally sound). Pleasing God is such kind of goal, it's never an action performed just for the sake of doing it but always as a step toward greater purpose - reaching eternal life and happiness through union with divine being.
