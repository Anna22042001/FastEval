On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

A zamindar who paid revenue to the Mogul was clearly in a position of dependence, and if he wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse, or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

The journey undertaken by Xuanzang in the 600s CE is best understood in light of the interconnections between religious syncretism and interregional trade. This is because the journey involved traveling to distant lands to obtain sacred texts for translation, which required both trading relationships and exchange of ideas across regions. Additionally, the fact that Xuanzang's own background included exposure to multiple religions, including Taoism, further highlights the importance of religious syncretism during this time period. Finally, it should also be noted that although some scholars argue that Buddhist missionaries were active during this time, others suggest that these travelers primarily engaged in translating existing texts rather than actively proselytizing or converting new populations. Thus, while missionary efforts may have occurred at times during the broader historical period, they appear less relevant specifically to Xuanzang's journey.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is likely the correct answer. Option A could apply to certain other periods but lacks evidence related to Xuanzang's specific journey, and option D similarly does not reflect the full range of motivations behind such travel. Option C is more plausible but still does not fully capture the nature of Xuanzang's particular activities and their significance, especially given the extent of interregional trade facilitated through his journey.
