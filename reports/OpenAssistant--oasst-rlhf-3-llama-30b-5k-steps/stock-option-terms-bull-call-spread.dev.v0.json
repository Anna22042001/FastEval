Therefore, your goal as an investor would be to try to increase the stock price above $410, which will cause both options to increase in value. On the other hand, if the stock price decreases, the sold option may lose value faster than the purchased option gains value, resulting in losses. However, there is still potential risk associated with this trade due to the possibility that the stock price could fall significantly below either strike price, causing significant losses.

An increase in stock price would cause the value of the sold call option (which gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price) to decrease due to the increasing difference between the current market price of the asset and the strike price specified in the option. This decrease in value of the sold option offsets the purchase price of the bought call option which increases its value as it becomes more likely that the asset will reach or exceed the lower strike price before expiration.

Both strategies involve selling a higher priced out-of-the-money call and buying a lower priced out-of-the-money call with the goal of benefiting from time decay on the short position while also gaining exposure to upward movement in stock price through the long position. However, without more information about the trader's overall portfolio and risk tolerance, it's difficult to say which specific strategy is being used. It's possible that this trade could also be classified as some other combination of options positions if there were additional orders placed by the trader. A BCS would likely result in net credit received upon entry into the order due to the sale of the more expensive call, whereas a LCC may not have any net credit gained depending on the exact strikes and prices involved. The profit/loss profile will differ between these two strategies as well based on how far above or below the sold call's strike the underlying asset ends up settling relative to each purchased call's respective strike price come expiration day.\n\nIn general, I think your initial assumption that the names of different option trading strategies can typically be determined simply based on knowing the details of individual purchase/sale transactions, along with their expiration date(s), is reasonable. Although there are often many ways to achieve similar results in terms of expected value changes over time based on various market conditions, there do tend to be relatively standardized nomenclatures developed within financial communities around popular methods of structuring option trades given certain parameters like those you specified here - such as buys & sells involving the same underlying security, expiring on the same future date, etc..
