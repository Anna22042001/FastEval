Derek Shepherd, also known as McDreamy on Grey's Anatomy died from a traumatic brain injury after being hit by an ambulance while saving multiple people during a storm in winter episode of Season 10, Episode 23 \"Everything I Try to Do, Nothing Seems to Turn Out Right\". He was pronounced dead at that hospital he loved so much and where he first met his wife Meredith Grey. It was very sad moment for all fans who watched the show over years. However this storyline helped progress many characters such as Meredith, Cristina Yang and Owen Hunt forward into interesting plotlines moving forward.
