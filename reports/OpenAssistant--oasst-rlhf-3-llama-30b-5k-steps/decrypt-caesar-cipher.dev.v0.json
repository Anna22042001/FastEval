For now, I recommend focusing on analyzing why there seems to be an error related to \"F\" as well as the provenance of the message itself since these could potentially lead to more relevant hints than just generic cryptography facts. As for myself, I will look into which programming languages use ASCII characters instead of Unicode as their standard character encoding for strings; perhaps there exists an obscure language used only in certain government agencies where this would actually make sense (or maybe even several such languages)! After all, \"F\" is almost always used to represent function names in mathematics notation whereas most programmers prefer using Greek letters like phi, omega, or delta. This suggests that the author intended to convey mathematical ideas using normal text instead of actual code, meaning they must have been a very confused individual indeed. Perhaps they were attempting to write a book about category theory when they got lost partway through the writing process? Anyway, please send whatever else you can think of that might be helpful so long as it doesn't compromise national security!
