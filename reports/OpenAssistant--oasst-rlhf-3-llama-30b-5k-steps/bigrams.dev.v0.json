This phenomenon is known as \"split digraphs.\" The actual letter combinations used depend on the language, but it always involves creating two new letters from the original two or more letters. In English, the split-digraph form looks like <schwa>+consonant (where schwa stands for any vowel sound). For example, the word \"wing\" becomes <schwa i n g>.

This question can also be used to test for proper word segmentation in NLP systems, since there are two instances of 'ng', one being part of the morpheme '-ing' which indicates an ongoing state or action (i.e., the gerund), and one being a separate consonant cluster that ends a word (i.e., the past-participle). Some techniques such as Markdown might incorrectly tokenize this sequence as a single trigram 'n' followed by a space followed by 'g'. There is some ambiguity in whether some rare usages of 'ng' should be considered the same phoneme; however, they all correspond to the same spelling and pronunciation so this usually causes no difficulty. In English orthography, 'ng' most commonly functions as a digraph that signals the velar nasal sound /Å‹/. Most speakers do not use separate sounds or mouth positions for 'ng' and the similar nasals (/m/, /n/, and /É´/). For example, the letters 'n' and 'ng' in the words 'singer' ( listen ) and singer (listen ), respectively, represent identical sounds: that of the tongue touching the back of the upper teeth before passing through the throat towards the uvula, without changing the shape of the lips, unlike what happens at the moment of pronouncing /tÊƒ/ ('ch') or /dÊ’/ ('j').
