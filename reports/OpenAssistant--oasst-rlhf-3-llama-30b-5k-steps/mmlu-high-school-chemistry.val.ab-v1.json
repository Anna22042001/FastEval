One mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number (6.02 x 10^23) particles. The atomic weight of carbon is approximately 12.01 g/mol and there are three naturally occurring stable isotopes: 98.89%, 1.11% and 0.0000000003%. We take into account only two, so the sum will be off by about 5 parts per million. In terms of percentages this translates to roughly 2.7% error. Thus we can approximate that one mole of carbon has an average atomic weight of roughly 14. Therefore Carbon-12 has a mass of exactly 12 g/mol, while Carbon-13 has a mass of 13 g/mol and Carbon-14 has a mass of 14 g/mol. So if we have one mole of each type of carbon then we have a total of 1+1+1 = 3 times as much mass than just one kind of carbon. Thus one mole of carbon has a mass of 3 * 12 g/mol = 36 g/mol or 36 grams. As a final note, I want to say that it is also possible to find the exact mass of one mole of carbon atoms by multiplying the atomic weight for all 3 isotopes (weighted according to their percentage occurrence). This gives us a value of 12.01 + 13.01 + 14.01 = ~39.03 g/mol.

In an element's ground state, all electrons are paired up in orbitals. This means they have a lower potential energy than if any were unpaired. Being unreactive or found free in nature does not necessarily mean an element is in its ground state (Answer A). An element being found naturally is determined by where it appears on the periodic table, regardless of whether it has paired electrons or not. The phrase \"lowest possible energy\" refers to the concept of electron configuration energy level, which pertains more closely to the idea of paired electrons (Answer C). Finally, Answer D is incorrect because there are elements found in nature that do not behave like this - for example, radioisotopes. Some radioisotopes are very reactive but still occur freely in nature due to natural processes such as uranium decaying into radon gas through alpha decay.
