This can be calculated by adding the net credit received ($1.05 + (-$2.35)) to the exercise price of the sold call, which results in a total income of -$2.35 + $410 = $407.65. Since options typically have zero intrinsic value when they expire out-of-the-money, the actual sale proceeds will be equal to this amount if both calls expire worthless. Therefore, the minimum possible profit that could be achieved under these circumstances would be the difference between this amount and the initial margin requirement for writing a covered call spread on 100 shares of XYZ stock with a delta of approximately -0.39, assuming a risk-free rate of return of about 0% and a time horizon of roughly 6 weeks. For comparison purposes, it's also important to note that the break even stock prices associated with a synthetic long position established using put options are $414.35 based on a Black Scholes model with implied volatility = 20%, interest rates = 0%, dividend yield = 0%, and time to maturity = 0.4 years.
