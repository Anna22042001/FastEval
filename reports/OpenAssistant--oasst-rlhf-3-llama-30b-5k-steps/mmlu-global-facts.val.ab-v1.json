The Kinsey Reports are two books by Alfred Kinsey and his co-authors which were published in 1948 and 1953 respectively. They contain information about sex based both on direct research as well as surveys filled out anonymously. Because of their controversial findings on human sexual behavior they caused widespread public debate upon release. Although there was some criticism at first, over time these reports have come to be considered groundbreaking works that changed scientific knowledge on this topic forever. In addition, they had significant cultural impact on post WWII America's views towards sex; prior to publication sexual education, for example, was almost non existent in the United States and any discussion of sexual matters was often taboo. Due to the openness promoted by these reports people became more comfortable discussing such topics and led to further advances in areas like women's rights, contraception, etc. Overall they remain very important studies today.

After the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, a poll found that over 85 percent of American respondents supported US aid to Japan despite potential domestic food shortages as a consequence (source: Pew Research Center).

Despite widespread hunger and poverty among ordinary Japanese people, Occupation authorities refused to divert supplies earmarked for the military or reduce rations given to Allied troops to help alleviate suffering among civilians (Wood). Thus, while official policies may not have reflected popular views on aid, individual acts of generosity and assistance by occupation soldiers likely mitigated some negative impacts of post-war scarcity.\n\nReference(s):\nPew Research Center - 'Japan's Rise Challenges U.S.-Led Order'\nRobert E Wood - 'The Myth of Six Million Starving Civilians in Post-War Japan'\nFood Security Portal - 'Hunger and Famine in Occupied Japan' (FAO)\n\nBonus Questions:\nQ: What was the largest factor contributing to the initial decision NOT to provide aid from America?\nConcern about rebuilding industrial infrastructure; avoiding inflation/hyperinflation and ensuring long term recovery\nRivalry with Soviet Union for influence during Cold War era\nPolitical tensions between Truman administration and Congress; disagreement over budget priorities\nDesire for revenge against defeated enemy population; refusal to assist those deemed responsible for aggression\nA) Concern about rebuilding industrial infrastructure; avoiding inflation/hyperinfl", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nAfter the Atom bomb how many Americans support giving aid to Japan even at the cost of food shortages?\nA) 85%\nB) 50%\nC) 66%\nD) 33%", "options": ["C"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 03:10:55.173507+00:00"}

However, worldwide, health care costs are rising at an alarming rate. In recent years the cost of new cancer drugs has risen nearly twice that amount, increasing by 9.5 percent per year over the past five years. The rise of biotech startups and orphan drug status have contributed to skyrocketing prescription drug prices for rare diseases. A study published by JAMA found that more than half of cancer patients were having difficulty paying medical bills and some had declared bankruptcy due to these costs. According to the American Cancer Society, cancer patients who were uninsured prior to their diagnosis faced even higher financial burdens. These increased economic burdens on patients could be counterproductive to overall population health goals if people forego necessary treatment because they cannot afford it. A similar trend can also be observed globally. While health care spending has been rising steadily around the globe in recent decades, growth has slowed since the 2008 financial crisis. Some experts believe this trend will continue as governments try to contain growing deficits and debt. Countries like Greece, Ireland, Spain, Brazil, India and South Africa illustrate this point especially well.
