Regular expressions are super useful and powerful tools that let programmers specify complex search patterns in text, which can then be used by their programs to find matches automatically. This allows developers to work much faster than they otherwise would, because even though computers are fast at searching through data, telling one bit from another requires extra processing time, whereas analyzing something once a person understands what to look for takes almost no time at all.
