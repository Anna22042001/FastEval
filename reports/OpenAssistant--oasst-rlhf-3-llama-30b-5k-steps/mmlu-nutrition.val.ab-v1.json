There are many different types of vegetarians including: lacto-ovo-vegetarians (who eat dairy products and eggs), pescatarians, flexitarians, fruitarian, etc.. The most common type of vegetarian however, is someone who eats no meat but does include other animal derived products like milk or honey in their diet. So if by \"vegetarian\" we mean only that definition then D is correct because all the options listed could be reasons to follow this specific version of a plant based lifestyle. However, there are some people who do choose to avoid all foods which come from animals whether it's due to environmental concerns such as reducing greenhouse gases produced by livestock rearing or perhaps they believe that using animals for our own benefit is unethical. These individuals would likely consider themselves vegan rather than simply vegetarian. Although the distinction may seem minor to some, there are many people for whom the label matters greatly especially when discussing topics related to what motivates them in life. As such I believe D to be incorrect because although it might describe most vegetarians it doesn't cover everyone under that umbrella term. Therefore B is also false since religious reasons certainly can factor into why someone chooses to not consume any animal products at all. That leaves us with option C being the one true answer. While many people adopt a plant based diet for ethical reasons, personal choice, or even just wanting to lose weight; there is scientific evidence to support that choosing to eliminate meat from your meals has several potential health benefits over time.

Since muscle requires more calories per unit weight than other tissues, having more lean mass will result in a higher BMR.

The presence of phytic acid, found in plant seeds and grains such as rice, can significantly reduce the absorption of non-heme (plant-derived) iron in our diets.\n\nCalcium competes with iron for absorption; however it does not affect its availability once absorbed.\nVitamin C enhances non-heme iron absorption by reducing ferric iron to ferrous iron which is more soluble. It also helps convert a compound called hexacoordinate Fe(III), that is formed when meat iron binds to your stomach's hydrochloric acid, into pentacoordinate Fe(II). This allows gut cells to take up more easily absorb the meat iron than would otherwise be possible.\nThe complex formation of iron with phosphate anions present in plants like rice, milk or yogurt reduces iron bioavailability by converting soluble iron forms into insoluble ones that are poorly absorbed. This process may be further increased if you consume these foods together without separating them by several hours since some protease enzyme activity from lactic acid bacteria in yogurt may help break down these phytates but only after they have already reduced the amount of available iron present in those meals.\nSo, while both calcium and vitamin c do not directly influence the final bioavailability of ingested non-haem iron, phytic acid plays the biggest role here. Hence choice D is correct. Choice A, B, and C are incorrect though all three answers have been used interchangeably on different web sources which makes this topic very confusing for many people!\nA good rule of thumb to follow if one wants to maximize their non haem iron intake is to avoid consuming high levels of phytates along side other iron", "prompt": "\nPlease answer with the letter of the correct answer.\n\nWhich of the following factors inhibits non-haem iron bioavailability the most?\n\nA) Vegetable protein\nB) Citric acid\nC) Calcium\nD) Phytic acid", "options": ["D"]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-18 04:33:10.570231+00:00"}
