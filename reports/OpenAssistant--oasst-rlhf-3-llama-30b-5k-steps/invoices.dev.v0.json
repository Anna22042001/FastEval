This is a single value and is found in the line that starts 'Amount charged'. The full line reads:\n'Amount charged   $424.62'. The next line shows what has happened to this money, it has been used to pay off an outstanding bill which means there is now no balance left, as shown by 'New Balance   $0.00'.\n\nAlthough the received date is given as 07/02/2022 (or 02/07/2022 if you are American) from the content we can tell that the payment actually occurred on 08/02/2022 ('Date   7 Feb 2022'). It seems unlikely that someone would be sending an email thanking for a payment before they had made it so I think this is just an error on behalf of whoever wrote the email. We know this because the wording says 'Thanks' at the end and implies that some action has taken place, but the details contained within show otherwise. In addition, the fact the message thanks the recipient, without saying why or how much they have done to deserve such gratitude, makes me suspect this might be a phishing scam designed to get people to click links.\nI believe my explanation above gives us everything needed to solve the problem; it correctly identifies the two relevant lines giving us both the payment amount and reason, and explains any additional details required to understand them.

Unknown if there could be more amounts due to exchange rates when used or more details on the receipt, but from this email alone, only $20.75 CAD was paid to Air Canada as indicated by the purchase summary, which is also the same as the total amount paid according to the receipt. There doesn't seem to be any reason why that price should fluctuate based on anything else listed in this receipt either so it should remain constant between both measures of currency (CAD vs USD). Note however I cannot confirm what exact rate of exchange exists right now or historically has existed to compare these two currencies so my analysis may be off if that rate changes drastically overtime although it seems very similar. Even though they are relatively close to parity, sometimes conversion rates vary quite wildly over small differences in numerical value due to rounding and precision issues in computing them so there might still be an error introduced even if it is negligible most times.
