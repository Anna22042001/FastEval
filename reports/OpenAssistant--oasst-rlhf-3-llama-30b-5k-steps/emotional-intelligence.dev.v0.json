This strategy allows Manuel time to process his emotions and make informed decisions before taking any further steps.\n2. Option (b): Talk to his boss or the management about it. Direct communication with his employer could provide clarity about their expectations of him in the new role, which may help ease any fears or misconceptions he might have.
