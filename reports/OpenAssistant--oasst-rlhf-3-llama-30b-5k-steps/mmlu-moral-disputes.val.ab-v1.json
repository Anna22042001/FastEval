Fine's argument against considering states as \"clubs\" relies mainly on his claim that they differ in three crucial respects: size, inclusiveness, and authority structure (Fine, op cit., p.85). He contends that states are vastly larger than any actual or conceivable association, that they encompass all those who live within their territory regardless of individual choice, and that the distribution of power among officials is hierarchical rather than democratic. These differences lead him to conclude that states cannot be compared to voluntary associations like golf clubs, which are typically smaller, exclusive, and run by their members on an egalitarian basis. Therefore, option B does not accurately reflect Fine's arguments.\n\nOption C suggests that exclusion from a golf club might not matter much to someone, whereas Fine emphasizes the importance of inclusion in political communities for human well-being.

It is sometimes called the \"principle of double effect\" or the \"rule of double effect.\"\n\nFor example, consider a case where a doctor must choose between administering a drug that will save their patient's life by curing a deadly disease, knowing that there is a risk of severe side-effects such as permanent disability or even death, or choosing not to treat the patient at all, thus allowing them to die from the disease. In this situation, the doctor intends to bring about a positive result (the cure), while also accepting the possibility of negative consequences (side-effects).

This theory focuses on the moral principle that people shouldn't get away with harmful actions just because they can; instead, they should face consequences for their misdeeds. By being held accountable through punishment, criminals are forced to confront and accept responsibility for what they did wrong.
