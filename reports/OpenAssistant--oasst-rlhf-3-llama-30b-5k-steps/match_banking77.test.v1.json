If so, did this resolve the problem?\n- Did you receive any communication from Monzo regarding issues with your disposable card specifically or generally (such as service outages or known bugs affecting certain features)?\nProviding details like these would allow me to better determine which category applies best to your situation, so feel free to share anything else relevant!", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a classification bot.
