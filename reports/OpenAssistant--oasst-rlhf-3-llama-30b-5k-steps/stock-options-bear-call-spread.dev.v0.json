This assumes the calls have no intrinsic value at expiration (i.e., the stock price is equal to the exercise/strike price). The breakeven stock price would be the sum of the premium paid for each option plus the difference between the strike prices minus any dividends received during that time. In this case, there would be no dividend payment as it was not specified. Therefore, the total breakeven stock price would be the sum of the absolute values of the net premiums paid per share for both options. The resulting breakeven stock prices are $376.26 for selling the $390 call and $376.26 for buying the $394 call. These calculations assume that all options were bought on the same day, had identical terms such as expiration date and implied volatility, and that the risk-free rate was constant over the life of the options. It also assumes that no transaction costs, taxes, or slippage occurred when trading the options.

Also, the calculation assumes the current time as t=0 and r=0 since it was not provided. Furthermore, the answer provided does not take into account any dividends paid by the underlying company before expiration of options which would change the Black-Scholes model parameters (spot, strike, volatility, risk free rate, and time to expiration). This would impact both the maximum gain and maximum loss for each individual option, but will have the opposite effect on the difference between them (i.e., the net credit received when selling the lower striking OTM call minus buying the higher striking ITM call), meaning that the overall max gain/max loss remains the same. Lastly, keep in mind that this ignores bid-ask spreads and commissions that may occur based on market conditions and brokerage fees. Thus the real world results could differ slightly than calculated here. However, using realistic estimates based on historical data and/or recent market trends can get you much closer to actual numbers; thus providing more accurate predictions.
