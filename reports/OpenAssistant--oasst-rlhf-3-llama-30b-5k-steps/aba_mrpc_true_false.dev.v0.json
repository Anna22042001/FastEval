Additionally, under Rule 1.3, a lawyer has an obligation to act with diligence in representing a client, including taking reasonable measures to educate themselves about the legal issues involved in a case if they are not already familiar with them.

Therefore, a lawyer must be able to demonstrate the required level of competence before accepting representation in any matter. However, if a lawyer lacks the requisite expertise or experience but can acquire it by study or association with another lawyer who is experienced in the area, they may still accept the representation as long as they take reasonable measures to ensure their competence. This would include seeking guidance from other lawyers, taking relevant continuing legal education courses, or consulting with experts in the field. Ultimately, a lawyer has an ongoing duty to maintain their competence throughout the course of representation, and must decline or withdraw from representation if they determine that they are unable to do so. So while there are some circumstances where a lawyer might legitimately accept representation despite lacking all necessary levels of competence, they should only do so if they are willing to take appropriate steps to remedy this deficiency promptly. As a general rule, a lawyer should think carefully before accepting representation when they know or reasonably suspect that they will be unable to handle the case effectively without additional resources such as co-counsel or outside help. By doing so, they can avoid potential ethical violations and protect themselves against malpractice claims down the road.

In such cases, the lawyer may assist the client in taking actions reasonably believed to be necessary to avoid causing such harm, but only if they also advises the client about any available legal options and informs them of the potential consequences of their actions. Additionally, lawyers must take reasonable measures to prevent, mitigate, or rectify any unintended consequences resulting from giving this advice, as outlined by Rule 3.4(c).

Additionally, local rules or laws could also affect this answer in specific jurisdictions. It should also be noted that some clients may choose not to delegate these decisions entirely to their lawyer which would require further discussion between lawyer and client on how to proceed. Overall, though, the general rule holds that the lawyer does have the final say in these decisions as long as they act in good faith and without undue influence from outside sources. For example, Rule 1.2 of the Model Rules states \"A lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation.\" But note that Rule 4-1.2(d) specifies that \"in a criminal case, a lawyer should follow the defendant's decisions on all matters relating to the defense\" (Emphasis added).
