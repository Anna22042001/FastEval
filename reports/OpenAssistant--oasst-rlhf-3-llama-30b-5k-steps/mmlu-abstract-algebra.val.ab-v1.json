If a group has an element of order 10, it means that there exists at least one element in the group that generates a cycle of length 10 when acted upon. The number of such elements must divide the total number of elements in the group (by Lagrange's theorem), so if this number is 10, we have exactly two such elements - they can be represented as (0,1,2,3,...) and (5,6,7,8,...). Thus, the statement is true.\n\nStatement 2 is false. We can easily find counterexamples for this statement. Let m=2 and n=3. Then mn=6 and phi(6)=2. However, phi(2)=1 and phi(3)=2, so phi(mn)=2 which is not equal to phi(m)phi(n). There are many other examples like this. In general, phi(mn) may or may not be equal to phi(m)phi(n), depending on whether m and n share any prime factors.

The statements you have given are as follows:\n\nStatement 1: If $a$ and $b$ are elements of **finite** order in an Abelian group, then $\\left|\\, ab\\, \\right|$ is the least common multiple of their orders.\n\nThis statement can be proven using basic properties of groups such as associativity, commutativity, and cancelability, along with the definition of order of an element. To see this, notice that $ab=ba$, so if $a^{m_a}=e$ and $b^{m_b}=e$, where $e$ is the identity element of the group, then $(ab)^{m_a+m_b} =(a^{m_a})(b^{m_b})=(ab)(ab)\\cdots (ab)=e$. Therefore, $ab$ has order at most $m_a + m_b$. Similarly, we can show that it has order at least $m_a + m_b$, which gives us the desired result.\n\nStatement 2: If $g$ is a group element and $g^n=e$, then the order of $g$ divides $n$.\n\nThis statement can also be proven by considering two cases based on whether $g$ is the inverse of itself or not. In either case, we can use properties of groups to derive a contradiction when assuming otherwise. For example, suppose $g$ has order greater than one but does not divide $n$. Then there exists some prime factorization of $n$ that doesn't appear in the prime factorization of the order of $g$. But this implies that $g$ cannot raise to any power equal to $n$, since raising $g$ to powers less than its order will never give us all factors of $n$ required for $g^n$ to equal $e$.

Since each factor only has two choices of generator they are both equal to their own order as generators. Taking into account all possible combinations of orders for these groups gives the set {[2,3],[4,3],[2,6]}. We want to minimize the sum [2+3=5],[4+3=7],[2+6=8]. So then we choose [4,3] for our smallest order or 7. Therefore, the maximum possible order of any single element is 24/7=3.429.... which rounds up to 3, however 3*order of any one of the other elements in the group gives us 3*2=6 so that must be included in the list above which leaves out choice B and C.
