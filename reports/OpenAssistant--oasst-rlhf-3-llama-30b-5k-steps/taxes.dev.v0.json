This depends on various factors such as the specific tax bracket thresholds for the given year and any other relevant tax laws or regulations.

According to the Tax Foundation, California had a top marginal income tax rate of 9.3% in 2021, while Massachusetts had a top rate of 5.1%. Therefore, we can estimate that about half of the total tax paid will go towards state taxes, or around $3,151 ($6,000 / 2 = $3,075). Adding this amount to the federal tax gives us a total estimated tax bill of $9,345 ($6,000 + $3,151). Rounding down to the nearest dollar, the answer would be C. 8,393.
