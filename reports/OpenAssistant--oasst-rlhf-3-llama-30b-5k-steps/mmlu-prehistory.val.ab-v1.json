Humans (Homo sapiens) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) share a common ancestor who lived around 6–8 million years ago. Since then, several key differences in the developmental processes between humans and chimps have arisen due to separate genetic paths. For example, while human embryos undergo neural crest formation in early fetal stages, this process never occurs in chimps, leading to structural variations in their brains. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation also differentiate between these species; as adults, humans exhibit higher levels of DNA methylation than do chimps. Overall, both anatomical and molecular evidence indicate that humans and chimps diverged along different evolutionary trajectories after initially sharing similar developmental pathways. Thus, the two species are not equivalent models for studying human diseases or for testing potential therapeutic interventions.\n\nReference: Huh WH et al. (2013).

Kivas are found throughout the Pueblo region and date back more than two thousand years ago; however, their use has been abandoned or modified over time by different cultures. Although some scholars have argued that Chacoan culture is linked to Mesoamerican civilizations based on similarities between certain features such as the construction of temples facing cardinal directions (north/south), it is still unclear whether these relationships extended beyond architectural similarities. Other aspects of Chacoan culture, such as astronomy, road systems, agriculture, social hierarchy, trade networks, and religious practices also bear remarkable resemblances to later traditions of the Southwest, which may suggest that there was continuity rather than just influence across time and space. Despite these similarities, some researchers argue against direct cultural diffusion from Mexico because they see too many differences, including material culture and iconography. Still others believe that there could have been multiple waves of migrations with varying degrees of contact among diverse populations who settled and adapted to specific environments over thousands of years.

Additionally, there are other hypotheses for the abandonment of the Mogollon region such as social inequality or political instability within the communities. Archaeological evidence has suggested that there were power struggles among different groups who controlled access to resources like water, land and minerals. This might have led to violent conflicts between the Mogollons and neighboring tribes such as the Apache and Navajo who invaded their territory. However, scholars still debate whether warfare played a significant role in the decline of the Mogollon culture since most sites lack defensive structures like walls, moats or palisades.
