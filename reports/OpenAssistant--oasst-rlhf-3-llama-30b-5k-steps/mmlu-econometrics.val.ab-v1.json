The fact that the same set of firms is observed over multiple time periods makes this a time series dataset. Note also, however, that it could be considered as a panel dataset because each firm represents an observation in its own right. In either case, it would not be qualitative or cross-sectional. It might additionally be a panel if we had information about different firms at different times (e.g., their stock returns). If so, then we'd have both a time series and a panel -- which I believe is what you meant by your clarification question! Regardless of whether one considers this to be a time series or a panel, my recommendation would be to fit some model with fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity across firms. Do you want me to show how one might do that? There are many ways to estimate such models, but here's one approach: we could use Stata's `plm` command. This allows us to include individual or group specific intercept terms, as well as more general linear combinations of covariates; see [here](https://www.stata.com/manuals13/pmvi.pdf#page=96) for details.

In contrast, ex post measures rely solely on information known at the time the estimate is made, and thus cannot be used for prediction purposes. A good example would be when comparing quarterly GDP growth forecasts that use only current or lagged values of endogenous explanatory variables versus those that also include more forward looking information like survey data or leading indices.

The peakedness around its mean is not necessarily higher, but can be, depending on the shape of the distribution. For example, a uniform distribution over an interval is both platykurtic (low kurtosis/flat-topped) and symmetric; however, a triangular distribution over that interval would also have low kurtosis like the former case but it will be negatively skewed and no longer symmetric anymore due to having heavier left tail.

If the null hypothesis of no difference between the two sets of estimates cannot be rejected, it suggests that both estimators are giving similar results, so either one can be used. However, if there is a statistically significant difference between them, this indicates that they are providing different results, which means that the assumption of independent observations underlying the fixed effects estimator may be violated. In this case, the preferred estimator should be based on random effects, as it takes into account the correlation among observations due to unobserved heterogeneity. Therefore, the statement (C) is false.\n\nThe other three statements are all true. Quasi-demeaning involves subtracting each observation's mean value from its actual values before fitting the regression. This leads to individual specific intercepts for each unit, allowing the model to capture time-invariant differences across units. A random effects model assumes that there is variation in the outcomes for each unit even when the predictors are held constant, whereas a fixed effects model assumes that these variations do not exist or have been removed by some method such as differencing. As a result, random effects estimation will not be appropriate if the composite error term is correlated with one or more of the explanatory variables in the model because this would violate the assumption of exogenous regressors required for valid inference in panel data analysis. For random effects models, the use of OLS would result in consistent but inefficient parameter estimation. This occurs because OLS assumes that there is only one way to achieve the same predicted outcome, while random effects allow for multiple ways depending on the distribution of unobservables within clusters, leading to overestimation of standard errors.
