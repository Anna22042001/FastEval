This statement exaggerates the extent of the wheel wobbling, suggesting that even a significant wobble is not enough to indicate any safety issues.\n\nBased on the analysis, it is clear that statement (B) is sarcastic because it exaggerates the extent of the wheel wobbling to emphasize the absurdity of suggesting that the bike is safe despite such a significant wobble.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

However, the question asks for the statement that is sarcastic, so we need to choose the one that is more sarcastic or ironic.\n\nThe word \"wonderful\" in statement (A) is more commonly used to express genuine admiration or delight, making it a stronger contrast to the baseless accusation. Therefore, statement (A) is the more sarcastic option.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
