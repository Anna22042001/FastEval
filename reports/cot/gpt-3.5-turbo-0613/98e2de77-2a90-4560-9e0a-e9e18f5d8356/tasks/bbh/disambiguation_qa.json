In this case, the possible antecedents are \"the nurse\" and \"the laborer.\"\n\nStep 3: Analyze the sentence structure\nThe sentence structure suggests that the pronoun \"they\" refers to the noun closest to it, which is \"the laborer.\" However, we need to consider the context and meaning of the sentence to be sure.\n\nStep 4: Consider the context and meaning\nThe sentence states that \"The nurse was running from the laborer because they smelled awful.\" This implies that the nurse is running away from someone who smells bad. It is unlikely that the nurse would be running away from themselves, so it is more logical to assume that \"they\" refers to the laborer.\n\nStep 5: Determine the answer\nBased on the analysis, the antecedent of the pronoun \"they\" is (B) The laborer.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

However, this interpretation does not align with the context of the sentence, as it states that Bailey plans to meet the director at the office. Therefore, option (A) is not the correct antecedent.\n\nOption (B) suggests that \"his\" refers to the director's office. This interpretation is more logical since it matches the context of the sentence. Bailey plans to meet the director, so it makes sense that they would meet at the director's office. Therefore, option (B) is a possible antecedent.\n\nTo determine if the antecedent is ambiguous, we need to consider if there is any other possible referent for the pronoun \"his.\" In this sentence, there is no other person or thing mentioned that could be the referent of \"his.\" Therefore, there is no ambiguity in this case.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the antecedent of the pronoun \"his\" in the sentence \"Bailey plans to meet the director at his office\" is (B) the director's office. \n\n(B)",
