The orange book is the second from the left.\n\nTo determine the rightmost book, we need to establish the order of the books from left to right.\n\nLet's start by considering the second statement. If the orange book is the second from the left, it means there is at least one book to the left of it. Since there are only three books in total, this implies that the orange book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\nNow let's consider the first statement. If the blue book is to the right of the yellow book, it means the yellow book must be to the left of the blue book. Since the orange book is the second from the left, it must be to the left of both the yellow and blue books. Therefore, the order from left to right must be: orange book, yellow book, blue book.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that the blue book is the rightmost book.
