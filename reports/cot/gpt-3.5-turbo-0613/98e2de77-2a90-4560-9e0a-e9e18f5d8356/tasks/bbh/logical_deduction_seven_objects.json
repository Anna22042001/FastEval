Therefore, the cheapest fruit must be either plums or peaches.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the kiwis are not the most expensive fruit. Therefore, the most expensive fruit must be either mangoes or watermelons.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that the pears are more expensive than the plums. Therefore, the plums must be cheaper than the pears.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that the oranges are less expensive than the kiwis.
