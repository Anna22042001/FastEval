            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to understand the concept of the enlightened self-interest model of CSR.\n\nThe enlightened self-interest model of CSR suggests that organizations should act in an ethical way because it is in their own best interest to do so. This means that organizations should consider the long-term benefits and consequences of their actions, rather than solely focusing on short-term gains.\n\nOption (A) states that it is in an organization's own best interest to put itself first rather than its ethics. This contradicts the enlightened self-interest model, as it suggests that organizations should prioritize their own interests over ethical considerations. Therefore, option (A) is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (B) states that it is in an organization's best interest to consider what a shareholder would want. While considering shareholder interests is important, the enlightened self-interest model goes beyond just shareholder concerns and emphasizes the broader ethical implications of an organization's actions. Therefore, option (B) is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) states that it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way. This aligns with the enlightened self-interest model, as it suggests that organizations should prioritize ethical behavior for their own long-term benefit. Therefore, option (C) is a possible correct answer.\n\nOption (D) states that it is in an organization's own best interest to follow the legislation and abide by the law. While legal compliance is important, the enlightened self-interest model goes beyond just legal requirements and encourages organizations to act ethically even when not explicitly mandated by law. Therefore, option (D) is not the correct answer.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is (C)",

            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to understand what predatory pricing is and what steps are involved in it.\n\n1. Predatory pricing is a strategy used by a company to set very low prices for its products or services with the intention of driving competitors out of the market.\n\n2. The first step in predatory pricing is for a company to set prices below its own costs. By doing this, the company can sustain losses in the short term, but it aims to eliminate competition and gain a monopoly position in the long run.\n\n3. The second step is to maintain the low prices for an extended period. This is important to ensure that competitors cannot sustain the losses and are forced to exit the market.\n\n4. The final step is for the company to raise prices once it has eliminated competition and gained a dominant market position. This allows the company to recoup its previous losses and maximize profits.\n\nBased on the steps involved in predatory pricing, the correct answer is (C) 1,2.",
