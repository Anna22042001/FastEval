We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that the rail system had little effect on the development of American industry, as stated in option (C).\n\nThe passage also does not mention anything about the entire national system being planned before the first railway was constructed, so we cannot conclude that this statement is true, as stated in option (B).\n\nThe passage does not mention the Confederacy or the Civil War, so we cannot conclude that a more highly developed rail system gave the Confederacy a decided advantage in the Civil War, as stated in option (D).\n\nThis leaves us with option (A), which states that government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient. Although the passage does not explicitly mention government subsidy, it does mention the \"excellence of divine principles\" and the \"law of brotherhood,\" which suggests a belief in the role of government in promoting equality and cooperation. Additionally, the passage mentions the nation's \"magnificent domain of space and time,\" which implies a vision of progress and expansion. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that government support, such as subsidies, could have played a role in the development of the American rail system.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A)",

This new world order is described as an era that is freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. It is also mentioned that this era will allow nations from all parts of the world to prosper and live in harmony.\n\nNow let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) The Monroe Doctrine: The Monroe Doctrine was a U.S. foreign policy that aimed to prevent European colonization in the Americas.

They emphasized self-determination, open diplomacy, and the establishment of a League of Nations. While there are some similarities in terms of pursuing peace and cooperation, President Bush's \"new world order\" goes beyond the aftermath of a specific war and aims for a broader global harmony.
