P is invertible:\nIf P is invertible, it means there exists a linear transformation Q such that PQ = QP = I, where I is the identity transformation. However, we are given that P^2 = P. If we multiply both sides of this equation by P^(-1), we get P = I. Therefore, P is only invertible if it is equal to the identity transformation.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable:\nA linear transformation is diagonalizable if it can be represented by a diagonal matrix. To determine if P is diagonalizable, we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Let \u03bb be an eigenvalue of P and v be the corresponding eigenvector. Then, Pv = \u03bbv. Multiplying both sides of this equation by P, we get P^2v = P(\u03bbv), which simplifies to P^2v = \u03bbPv. Since P^2 = P, we have Pv = \u03bbPv. If \u03bb is nonzero, we can divide both sides of this equation by \u03bb to get v = Pv/\u03bb. This means that v is an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb. However, if \u03bb = 0, then Pv = 0v = 0, which means v is the zero vector. In this case, P does not have a corresponding eigenvector. Therefore, the only eigenvalue of P is 0, and P is diagonalizable if and only if the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 is equal to the dimension of V.\n\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation:\nWe have already determined that P can be equal to the identity transformation. To determine if P can be the zero transformation, we need to check if P = 0 satisfies the condition P^2 = P. Since the zero transformation maps every vector to the zero vector, we have P^2v = 0 for all v in V. Therefore, P^2 = 0, which satisfies the condition P^2 = P. Therefore, P can also be the zero transformation.\n\nBased on our analysis, statements I, II, and III are all true. Therefore, the answer is (A) None.",

Since K is bounded, there exists a positive real number M such that for every point x in K, ||x|| \u2264 M, where ||x|| represents the Euclidean norm of x. \n\nNow, let's consider a continuous real-valued function f defined on K. By the Extreme Value Theorem, since K is compact, f must attain its maximum and minimum values on K.

Therefore, K = A' \u222a B' is a union of closed sets. By the finite intersection property, there exists a finite subcover of K, which means that K can be covered by finitely many closed sets.
