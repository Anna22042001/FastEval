            "model_answer": "To determine the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, we need to consider the types of genetic mutations that can occur.\n\n1. Deletion: A deletion mutation involves the loss of one or more nucleotides from the DNA sequence. This type of mutation can disrupt the reading frame and lead to a non-functional protein. It is possible for a deletion mutation to be the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, but we need to consider other possibilities.\n\n2. Duplication: A duplication mutation involves the replication of one or more nucleotides in the DNA sequence. This type of mutation can also disrupt the reading frame and result in a non-functional protein. While a duplication mutation could be common in cystic fibrosis, we still need to consider other options.\n\n3. Substitution: A substitution mutation, also known as a point mutation, involves the replacement of one nucleotide with another in the DNA sequence. This type of mutation can have varying effects depending on the specific substitution. It is possible for a substitution mutation to be the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, but we should consider the last option as well.\n\n4. Insertion: An insertion mutation involves the addition of one or more nucleotides to the DNA sequence. This type of mutation can disrupt the reading frame and lead to a non-functional protein. An insertion mutation could potentially be the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, but we need to compare it with the other options.\n\nTo determine the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, we need to consider the prevalence of each type of mutation in individuals with cystic fibrosis. The most reliable way to obtain this information is through scientific research and studies conducted on cystic fibrosis patients.\n\nOutput: (C) a substitution.",

Heritability refers to the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to genetic factors.\n\nStep 3: Since there is evidence of greater than 50% heritability, it means that genetic factors play a significant role in determining BMI.\n\nStep 4: However, the question specifically asks about the proportion of variation explained by known SNPs in genome-wide association studies. SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) are variations in a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence that occur commonly within a population.\n\nStep 5: It is important to note that not all genetic factors are captured by known SNPs. There may be other genetic variations or factors that are not accounted for in genome-wide association studies.\n\nStep 6: Given that known SNPs do not capture all genetic factors and there is evidence of greater than 50% heritability, it is reasonable to assume that the proportion of variation explained by known SNPs would be less than the heritability estimate.\n\nStep 7: Based on the answer choices, the options that indicate a proportion less than 50% are (A) only 5%, (B) less than 1%, (C) only 13%, and (D) less than 2%.\n\nStep 8: Since the heritability estimate is greater than 50%, options (A) and (B) can be eliminated as they indicate proportions that are too low.\n\nStep 9: This leaves us with options (C) only 13% and (D) less than 2%.\n\nStep 10: Given that known SNPs do not capture all genetic factors, it is reasonable to assume that the proportion explained by known SNPs would be less than 13%.\n\nStep 11: Therefore, the answer is (D) less than 2%.",

            "model_answer": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. If left untreated, high levels of phenylalanine can build up in the blood and cause intellectual disability and other health problems in children.\n\nTo determine the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria, we need to consider the inheritance pattern of PKU.\n\nPKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must carry a copy of the mutated gene for their child to be affected. If only one parent carries the mutated gene, the child will be a carrier but not affected by the disorder.\n\nLet's consider the scenario where the mother has untreated phenylketonuria. This means that she has two copies of the mutated gene for PKU.\n\nNow, we need to know the genotype of the father to determine the risk of abnormality in the child. If the father is a carrier (heterozygous), meaning he has one normal gene and one mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that the child will inherit the mutated gene from the father and be a carrier, but not affected by PKU.\n\nIf the father does not carry the mutated gene (homozygous normal), meaning he has two normal genes, then the child will not inherit the mutated gene and will not be affected by PKU.\n\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria depends on the genotype of the father. If the father is a carrier, the risk is 50%. If the father does not carry the mutated gene, the risk is 0%.\n\nNow, let's output the answer:\n\n(D) Almost 100%",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to understand what familial hypercholesterolaemia is and what causes it.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of cholesterol in the blood. It is typically caused by mutations in genes that are involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism.\n\nOne of the key genes associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia is the gene that encodes the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). The LDLR is responsible for removing low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from the bloodstream by binding to LDL particles and internalizing them into cells.\n\nMutations in the LDLR gene can impair the function of the LDLR protein, leading to reduced clearance of LDL cholesterol from the blood. This results in elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the gene which encodes the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is the gene that is mutated in familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Low density lipoprotein receptor",

We need to determine which option is the most likely outcome.\n\nStep 2: Understand the concept of inbreeding coefficient\nThe inbreeding coefficient, F, measures the probability that two alleles at a given locus in an individual are identical by descent. In other words, it quantifies the level of inbreeding in a population.\n\nStep 3: Analyze option (A)\nOption (A) states that an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population. This is because inbreeding increases the probability of individuals inheriting two copies of the same allele, leading to a decrease in heterozygosity.\n\nStep 4: Analyze option (B)\nOption (B) states that an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in a higher proportion of genes that show linkage. Linkage refers to the tendency of genes to be inherited together due to their physical proximity on a chromosome. Inbreeding can increase the likelihood of genes being inherited together, thus increasing the proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\nStep 5: Analyze option (C)\nOption (C) states that an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in a higher proportion of genes with introns. Introns are non-coding regions of DNA found within genes. Inbreeding is not directly related to the presence of introns, so this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nStep 6: Analyze option (D)\nOption (D) states that an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in a higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells. Inbreeding does not directly affect the level of difference between RNA molecules in daughter cells, so this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nStep 7: Determine the correct answer\nBased on the analysis of the options, the most likely outcome of an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population (option A).\n\nAnswer: (A)",
