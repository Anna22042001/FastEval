            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider its atomic structure.\n\nStep 1: Determine the atomic number of manganese (Mn).\nThe atomic number of manganese is 25.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of 55Mn.\nThe number 55 in 55Mn represents the atomic mass of the nuclide, which is the sum of protons and neutrons. Since the atomic number of manganese is 25, the number of protons is also 25. Therefore, the number of neutrons can be calculated as 55 - 25 = 30.\n\nStep 3: Determine the energy levels based on the number of protons and neutrons.\nThe energy levels in an atom are determined by the arrangement of electrons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. Since the atomic number of manganese is 25, there are 25 electrons.\n\nThe energy levels in an atom are given by the formula 2n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number can range from 1 to infinity.\n\nTo determine the number of energy levels, we need to find the highest value of n that satisfies the condition 2n^2 \u2264 25.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the highest value of n.\nBy substituting different values of n into the inequality, we can find the highest value of n that satisfies the condition.\n\nFor n = 1: 2(1)^2 = 2 \u2264 25 (satisfied)\nFor n = 2: 2(2)^2 = 8 \u2264 25 (satisfied)\nFor n = 3: 2(3)^2 = 18 \u2264 25 (satisfied)\nFor n = 4: 2(4)^2 = 32 > 25 (not satisfied)\n\nTherefore, the highest value of n that satisfies the condition is n = 3.\n\nStep 5: Determine the number of energy levels.\nThe number of energy levels is equal to the highest value of n.\n\nTherefore, the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide is 3.\n\nAnswer: (A) 3",
