            "model_answer": "To determine the answer to this question, we need to consider the information provided and make an educated guess based on our understanding of bariatric surgery and its effects on type 2 diabetes in obese individuals.\n\nBariatric surgery is a procedure used for obesity treatment. It involves making changes to the digestive system to help individuals lose weight. One of the potential benefits of bariatric surgery is the reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) 80-90%: This option suggests a significant reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery. It seems plausible since bariatric surgery is known to have a positive impact on diabetes. However, we cannot be certain if the reduction is as high as 80-90%.\n\n(B) No reduction in the incidence: This option suggests that bariatric surgery has no effect on the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. This seems unlikely since bariatric surgery is specifically used as a treatment for obesity-related health issues, including type 2 diabetes.\n\n(C) Approximately 50%: This option suggests a moderate reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery. This could be a reasonable estimate since bariatric surgery is known to have a positive impact on diabetes, but it may not be as high as 80-90%.\n\n(D) None of the options given is correct: This option suggests that none of the provided options accurately represent the reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery. While this is a possibility, we should consider the likelihood of this being the correct answer based on our understanding of bariatric surgery.\n\nBased on our reasoning, it seems most reasonable to choose option (C) Approximately 50% as the answer. This suggests a moderate reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals after bariatric surgery.\n\nAnswer: (C)",
