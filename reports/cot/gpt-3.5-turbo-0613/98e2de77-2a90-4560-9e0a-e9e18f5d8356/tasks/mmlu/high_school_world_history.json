            "model_answer": "To determine which statement about the period 600-1450 C.E. is supported by the passage, we need to analyze the information provided.\n\nThe passage mentions a sultan named Musa who has a copper mine in a town called ZKRY. The copper ingots from this mine are brought to BYTY. The passage also states that the crude copper is the only item on which a duty is levied, and it is sent to the land of the pagan Sudan to be sold for two-thirds of its weight in gold.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) as they do not relate to the content of the passage.\n\nOption (B) suggests that international trade connections were still being developed in the period. The passage supports this statement as it describes the trade of copper from ZKRY to BYTY and the subsequent sale of the copper in the land of the pagan Sudan. This indicates that there were trade connections between different regions during this period.\n\nOption (C) suggests that diseases spread along trade routes. The passage does not provide any information about diseases or their spread, so we cannot conclude that this statement is supported.\n\nTherefore, the statement supported by the passage is (B) International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThe answer is (B).",

According to the passage, the Chamavi and Angrivarii entered the settlements of the Bructeri, drove them out, and exterminated them with the help of neighboring tribes. This suggests that the treatment of barbarian peoples during this time involved conflict, expulsion, and extermination.\n\nNow, we need to find an option that describes a similar treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 C.E. and 1450 C.E. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\nThis option suggests that barbarian peoples were assimilated into the religions of their host societies. However, the passage does not mention anything about religious conversion as a treatment of barbarian peoples during Tacitus' time. Therefore, this option is not similar to the treatment described in the passage.\n\n(B) Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\nThis option suggests that barbarian peoples were used as soldiers by their host societies. While the passage does not explicitly mention this treatment, it does mention the conflict between the different tribes, which implies the use of military force. Therefore, this option is similar to the treatment described in the passage.\n\n(C) Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\nThis option suggests that barbarian peoples were systematically made into slaves or subjected to servile status through the laws of their host societies. The passage does not provide any information about the laws or servile status of barbarian peoples during Tacitus' time. Therefore, this option is not similar to the treatment described in the passage.\n\n(D) Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\nThis option suggests that barbarian peoples were invited to rule over the societies instead of the existing ruling classes. The passage does not mention anything about barbarian peoples being invited to rule. Instead, it describes conflict and extermination. Therefore, this option is not similar to the treatment described in the passage.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that is similar to the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 B.C.E. and 600 C.E. is (B) Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\n(B)",
