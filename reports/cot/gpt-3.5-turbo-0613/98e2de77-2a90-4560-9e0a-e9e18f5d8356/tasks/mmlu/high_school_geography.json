            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which country is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the availability of resources within each country.\n\n(A) United States: The United States is known for its abundant natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and various minerals. It has a diverse range of resources and is relatively self-sufficient in terms of natural resources.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is a resource-poor country with limited natural resources. It heavily relies on imports for many of its raw materials, including fossil fuels, metals, and minerals. Japan is not self-sufficient in natural resources.\n\n(C) France: France has a diverse range of natural resources, including coal, iron ore, bauxite, uranium, and agricultural products. While it does import some resources, it also has a significant level of self-sufficiency in natural resources.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has limited natural resources, particularly in terms of fossil fuels. It relies heavily on imports for oil, gas, and coal. However, it does have some natural resources such as tin, limestone, and clay. Overall, the United Kingdom is less self-sufficient in natural resources compared to the United States and France.\n\nBased on this analysis, the country that is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry is (B) Japan.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the options one by one:\n\n(A) Contagious diffusion: This type of diffusion occurs when an idea or innovation spreads rapidly and widely from person to person, similar to the spread of a contagious disease. While fashion trends can spread quickly, they do not typically spread in a person-to-person manner like a contagious disease.\n\n(B) Relocation diffusion: This type of diffusion occurs when an idea or innovation is physically carried by individuals or groups as they move from one place to another. While fashion trends can be influenced by individuals who travel and bring new styles with them, this is not the primary process by which a new fashion design is introduced globally.\n\n(C) Innovative diffusion: This term refers to the spread of new ideas or innovations through a society or culture. It is possible that a new fashion design could be introduced globally through innovative diffusion, as it involves the adoption and acceptance of the new design by individuals and groups.\n\n(D) Hierarchical diffusion: This type of diffusion occurs when an idea or innovation spreads from a higher authority or influential group to other individuals or groups. In the context of fashion, hierarchical diffusion could occur if a new design is introduced by a well-known designer or a celebrity, and then adopted by others.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is (C) innovative diffusion, as it best describes the process by which a new fashion design is initially introduced globally.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, we need to understand the key concepts of his theory.\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation suggests that economic development is not a self-equilibrating process, but rather a cumulative one. It emphasizes the role of initial advantages and how they can lead to further growth and prosperity.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement aligns with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. It suggests that trade can lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth between developing and developed regions.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement aligns with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. It suggests that the core, which refers to regions with initial advantages, will continue to dominate the periphery, which refers to regions without such advantages.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement aligns with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. It suggests that the growth and prosperity of the core comes at the expense of the periphery, as resources and opportunities are concentrated in the core.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement aligns with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. It suggests that regions with initial advantages can attract labor, capital, and trade, which further enhances their advantage and leads to cumulative growth.\n\nBased on the analysis, statement (A) is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. It suggests a more equal distribution of wealth through trade, whereas Myrdal's theory emphasizes the concentration of wealth in regions with initial advantages.\n\nThe answer is (A).",

Many transnational corporations choose to locate their headquarters in world cities due to their global influence and connectivity.\n\n(B) World cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities.\nThis is also a characteristic of world cities. World cities are typically well connected to other world cities, including both primary and secondary-level cities, through transportation networks and communication systems.\n\n(C) World cities contain many offices of multinational organizations.\nThis is another characteristic of world cities. Multinational organizations often establish offices in world cities to take advantage of the global market and access to resources and talent.\n\n(D) World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres.\nThis statement is not accurate.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts mentioned in the options and determine which one best fits the description given.\n\n1. The substitution principle: This principle refers to the idea of replacing one factor of production with another in order to achieve the same output. It does not relate to the concentration of production activities and people spatially, so we can eliminate option (A).\n\n2. Deglomeration: This term refers to the process of dispersing or decentralizing economic activities and people away from concentrated areas. It is the opposite of agglomeration, which is mentioned in option (C). Since we are looking for the term that describes the concentration of production activities and people spatially, we can eliminate option (B).\n\n3. Agglomeration: This term refers to the concentration of production activities and people spatially in a specific area. It often occurs due to the benefits of economies of scale, knowledge spillovers, and access to resources and markets. Agglomeration fits the description given, so it is a possible answer.\n\n4. Infrastructure: This term refers to the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise. While infrastructure is important for supporting agglomeration, it does not directly describe the concentration of production activities and people spatially. Therefore, we can eliminate option (D).\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is (C) agglomeration.",
