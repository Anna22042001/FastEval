            "model_answer": "To determine which of the statements are true, let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nAt the highest point, the ball momentarily stops moving before it starts falling back down. This means that its speed is indeed zero at the highest point. Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nAcceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes. At the highest point, the ball changes its direction of motion from upward to downward, which means its velocity is changing. Therefore, the ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nDue to the presence of air resistance, the ball experiences a greater force opposing its upward motion compared to its downward motion. This means that it takes longer for the ball to reach the highest point than to fall back down. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct statements are I and III. Therefore, the answer is (D) I & III only.",

            "model_answer": "To find the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on particle A to that on particle B, we need to use Coulomb's Law. Coulomb's Law states that the magnitude of the electric force between two charged particles is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nLet's denote the magnitude of the electric force on particle A as F_A and the magnitude of the electric force on particle B as F_B.\n\nAccording to Coulomb's Law, the magnitude of the electric force between two charged particles can be calculated using the formula:\n\nF = k * (|q1| * |q2|) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the magnitude of the electric force, k is the electrostatic constant (k = 9 * 10^9 N m^2/C^2), |q1| and |q2| are the magnitudes of the charges of the particles, and r is the distance between the particles.\n\nIn this case, particle A has a net charge of 2Q and particle B has a net charge of Q. The distance between the particles is 4 m.\n\nUsing Coulomb's Law, we can write the following equations:\n\nF_A = k * (|2Q| * |Q|) / (4^2)\nF_B = k * (|Q| * |Q|) / (4^2)\n\nTo find the ratio of F_A to F_B, we can divide F_A by F_B:\n\nF_A / F_B = (k * (|2Q| * |Q|) / (4^2)) / (k * (|Q| * |Q|) / (4^2))\n\nSimplifying the equation, we can cancel out the k and the 4^2 terms:\n\nF_A / F_B = (|2Q| * |Q|) / (|Q| * |Q|)\n\nSimplifying further, we can cancel out one of the |Q| terms:\n\nF_A / F_B = |2Q| / |Q|\n\nSince we are only interested in the ratio of the magnitudes of the forces, we can ignore the signs of the charges.\n\nF_A / F_B = 2Q / Q\n\nSimplifying the equation, we can cancel out the Q terms:\n\nF_A / F_B = 2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on particle A to that on particle B is 2.\n\nThe answer is (B) 2:01.",

The velocity of the electron is given as 10^7 m/s, and the magnetic field is given as 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T.\n\nPlugging in these values, we can calculate the magnetic force on the electron:\n\nF = (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(10^7 m/s)(5 \u00d7 10^-5 T)\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\nF = -8 \u00d7 10^-17 N\n\nThe magnetic force provides the centripetal force that keeps the electron moving in a circle. The centripetal force is given by the equation:\n\nF = mv^2/r\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the mass of the electron is 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg.

Since the object is floating, the weight of the water displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the object. Therefore, the weight of the water displaced is also 6 N.\n\nWe can use Archimedes' principle to find the volume of the water displaced.

            "model_answer": "To determine which quantity is directly measured using the slope of the graph, we need to understand the relationship between the net force and acceleration.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law of motion, the net force acting on an object is directly proportional to its acceleration. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nF = m * a\n\nwhere F is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration.\n\nIf we rearrange this equation, we can see that the slope of the graph (which represents the ratio of the change in net force to the change in acceleration) is equal to the mass of the object:\n\nm = F / a\n\nTherefore, the quantity directly measured using the slope of the graph is the mass of the object.\n\nThe answer is: (A) Gravitational mass",
