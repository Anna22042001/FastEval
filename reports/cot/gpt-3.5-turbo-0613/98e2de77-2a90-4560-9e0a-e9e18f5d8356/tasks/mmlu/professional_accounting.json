            "model_answer": "To determine which of the options a successor auditor would ask the predecessor auditor to provide after accepting an audit engagement, we need to consider the purpose and responsibilities of a successor auditor.\n\nA successor auditor is the auditor who takes over the audit engagement from the predecessor auditor. The successor auditor has the responsibility to evaluate the work of the predecessor auditor and to determine whether to rely on the predecessor auditor's work.\n\nOption (A) states that the successor auditor would ask for disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management as to significant accounting policies and principles. This information would be relevant for the successor auditor to understand any potential issues or differences in opinion between the predecessor auditor and management.\n\nOption (B) states that the successor auditor would ask for the predecessor auditor's understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors. This information would be important for the successor auditor to understand the circumstances surrounding the change of auditors and any potential issues or concerns that led to the change.\n\nOption (C) states that the successor auditor would ask for facts known to the predecessor auditor that might bear on the integrity of management. This information would be crucial for the successor auditor to assess the integrity and reliability of management and to identify any potential risks or concerns.\n\nOption (D) states that the successor auditor would ask for matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years. This information would be necessary for the successor auditor to assess the consistency and comparability of financial statements between the current and prior years.\n\nBased on the responsibilities and objectives of a successor auditor, it is reasonable to conclude that all of the options listed would be relevant and important for the successor auditor to request from the predecessor auditor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (E) All of the above.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which segments are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's financial statements, we need to consider the criteria set out in the relevant accounting standards. \n\nOne common criterion for separate disclosure is if a segment's reported revenue, including both sales to external customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10% or more of the combined revenue of all operating segments. \n\nLet's calculate the percentage of revenue for each segment:\n\nSegment A revenue: $42,000\nSegment B revenue: $121,000\nSegment C revenue: $14,000\nTotal revenue: $177,000\n\nPercentage of revenue for each segment:\nSegment A: ($42,000 / $177,000) * 100 = 23.73%\nSegment B: ($121,000 / $177,000) * 100 = 68.36%\nSegment C: ($14,000 / $177,000) * 100 = 7.91%\n\nBased on the revenue criterion, Segment A and Segment B meet the requirement for separate disclosure as their revenue percentages are both above 10%. Segment C, however, does not meet the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) A and B only.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the options is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice, we need to analyze each option and consider its relevance to quality control in auditing.\n\n(A) Acceptance of a client relationship: This option refers to the process of accepting a client engagement. It is an important element of quality control as it involves assessing the client's integrity, competence, and ethical values. Acceptance of a client relationship is directly related to quality control in auditing.\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management: Professional skepticism is a fundamental principle in auditing. It refers to the auditor's questioning mindset and critical assessment of management's assertions. Professional skepticism is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of financial statements. Therefore, professional skepticism of management is an element of quality control in auditing.\n\n(C) Computer information processing: While computer information processing is an important aspect of modern auditing, it is not specifically related to quality control policies and procedures. It is more relevant to the use of technology and data analytics in auditing procedures.\n\n(D) Efficiency of organizational structures: While efficiency is an important consideration for any organization, it is not directly related to quality control in auditing. Quality control focuses on ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of audit procedures, rather than the efficiency of organizational structures.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the options that are elements of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice are:\n\n(A) Acceptance of a client relationship.\n(B) Professional skepticism of management.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A)(B).",

This statement is not entirely accurate because the ownership of a specific value of stock is not a requirement for this right.\n\n(C) The statement \"Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose\" suggests that a shareholder must have a valid reason or purpose for requesting to inspect corporate books and records. This statement is accurate because shareholders must demonstrate a proper purpose, such as investigating potential mismanagement or fraud, to exercise this right.\n\n(D) The statement \"Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged\" suggests that the right to inspect corporate books and records is only applicable when fraud or illegality is suspected.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To find the effective annual interest cost, we need to consider the interest rate, the compensating balance, and the commitment fee.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the interest expense on the borrowed amount.\nThe interest rate on the borrowed amount is 10%. Therefore, the interest expense on $200,000 for one year is $200,000 * 10% = $20,000.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the compensating balance.\nThe compensating balance is 15% of the borrowed amount. Therefore, the compensating balance on $200,000 is $200,000 * 15% = $30,000.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the commitment fee on the unused amount.\nThe commitment fee is 1% of the unused amount of the credit line. Since the firm borrowed $200,000 out of the $500,000 credit line, the unused amount is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000. Therefore, the commitment fee is $300,000 * 1% = $3,000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the effective annual interest cost.\nThe effective annual interest cost is the sum of the interest expense, the compensating balance, and the commitment fee, divided by the net amount borrowed.\nThe net amount borrowed is the borrowed amount minus the compensating balance, which is $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\nThe effective annual interest cost is ($20,000 + $30,000 + $3,000) / $170,000 = $53,000 / $170,000.\n\nNow we can calculate the percentage:\n($53,000 / $170,000) * 100 = 31.18%\n\nTherefore, the effective annual interest cost is closest to 31.18%, which is approximately 31.2%.\n\nThe answer is (C) 26.5 percent.",
