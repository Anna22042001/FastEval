            "model_answer": "To estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we can start by considering the population of the United States and the average number of movies watched per person.\n\n1. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the estimated population of the United States is around 331 million people as of 2020.\n\n2. Next, we need to estimate the average number of movies watched per person in a year. This can vary greatly depending on individual preferences and habits. Let's assume a conservative estimate of 10 movies per person per year.\n\n3. To calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we multiply the population by the average number of movies watched per person: 331 million * 10 = 3,310 million.\n\n4. However, the answer choices are given in different units (millions, billions, trillions). To convert the answer to the correct unit, we divide the result by 1,000 million (1 billion): 3,310 million / 1,000 million = 3.31 billion.\n\nTherefore, the approximate number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year is (B) 2,000,000,000.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the energy wasted by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks, we need to consider the amount of ice thrown out and the energy required to melt that ice.\n\n1. Determine the average amount of ice thrown out per drink:\n   - On average, a typical drink contains about 2-3 ice cubes.\n   - Let's assume that each ice cube has a volume of 1 cm^3.\n\n2. Calculate the mass of ice thrown out per drink:\n   - The density of ice is approximately 0.92 g/cm^3.\n   - Since the volume of each ice cube is 1 cm^3, the mass of each ice cube is 0.92 g.\n\n3. Convert the mass of ice thrown out per drink to kilograms:\n   - 1 g = 0.001 kg\n   - Therefore, the mass of each ice cube is 0.92 g * 0.001 kg/g = 0.00092 kg.\n\n4. Calculate the energy required to melt the ice:\n   - The specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.09 J/g\u00b0C.\n   - The temperature change required to melt ice is 0\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C (since it is already at its melting point).\n   - Therefore, the energy required to melt each ice cube is 0.00092 kg * 2.09 J/g\u00b0C * (0\u00b0C - 0\u00b0C) = 0 J.\n\n5. Determine the average number of drinks consumed per year by Americans:\n   - According to a survey, the average American consumes about 400 drinks per year.\n\n6. Calculate the total energy wasted per year:\n   - Multiply the energy wasted per drink (0 J) by the average number of drinks consumed per year (400):\n     0 J * 400 = 0 J.\n\nBased on the calculations, the answer is (A) 6*10^8 J.",
