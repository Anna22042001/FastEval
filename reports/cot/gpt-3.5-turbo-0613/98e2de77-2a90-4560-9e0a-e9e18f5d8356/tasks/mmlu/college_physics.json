            "model_answer": "To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the potential energy and kinetic energy.\n\n1. Potential Energy: The potential energy of the spring is given by the formula U = (1/2)kx^2, where U is the potential energy, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n2. Kinetic Energy: The kinetic energy of the mass is given by the formula K = (1/2)mv^2, where K is the kinetic energy, m is the mass, and v is the velocity.\n\n3. Total Mechanical Energy: The total mechanical energy is the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy, E = U + K.\n\nNow let's calculate the values step-by-step:\n\n1. Potential Energy:\nGiven: k = ?, x = 0.030 m\nWe need to find the spring constant, k. The spring constant can be calculated using Hooke's Law, F = -kx, where F is the force exerted by the spring and x is the displacement.\nGiven: m = 0.30 kg, g = 9.8 m/s^2 (acceleration due to gravity)\nThe force exerted by the spring is equal to the weight of the mass, F = mg.\nSubstituting the values, mg = -kx.\nSolving for k, k = -(mg/x).\nSubstituting the given values, k = -(0.30 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) / 0.030 m.\n\n2. Kinetic Energy:\nGiven: m = 0.30 kg, v = 0.040 m/s\nUsing the formula K = (1/2)mv^2, we can calculate the kinetic energy.\n\n3. Total Mechanical Energy:\nThe total mechanical energy is the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy, E = U + K.\n\nNow let's calculate the values:\n\n1. Potential Energy:\nk = -(0.30 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) / 0.030 m\n\n2. Kinetic Energy:\nK = (1/2) * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2\n\n3. Total Mechanical Energy:\nE = U + K\n\nNow let's calculate the values:\n\n1. Potential Energy:\nk = -(0.30 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) / 0.030 m\nk = -9.8 N/m\n\n2. Kinetic Energy:\nK = (1/2) * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2\nK = 0.00024 J\n\n3. Total Mechanical Energy:\nE = U + K\nE = (1/2)kx^2 + 0.00024 J\n\nNow let's substitute the values and calculate the total mechanical energy:\n\nE = (1/2)(-9.8 N/m)(0.030 m)^2 + 0.00024 J\n\nCalculating this expression gives us the total mechanical energy of the system.\n\nE = 0.00024 J\n\nConverting this to millijoules (mJ), we get:\n\nE = 0.24 mJ\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 0.24 mJ.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work and energy. \n\n1. We know that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. In this case, the work done on the box is equal to the change in its kinetic energy when the force is applied and when it is removed.\n\n2. The initial kinetic energy of the box is given by the equation KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the box (10 kg) and v is its initial velocity (1 m/s). Plugging in the values, we find that the initial kinetic energy is 5 J.\n\n3. When the force is applied and the box travels 5 m, the work done on the box is equal to the force applied multiplied by the distance traveled. Let's call the magnitude of the applied force F. The work done is then given by W = Fd, where d is the distance traveled (5 m). Therefore, the work done is 5F J.\n\n4. When the force is removed and the box has a final velocity of 2 m/s, the final kinetic energy of the box is given by KE = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass of the box (10 kg) and v is its final velocity (2 m/s). Plugging in the values, we find that the final kinetic energy is 20 J.\n\n5. The change in kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is 20 J - 5 J = 15 J.\n\n6. Since the work done on the box is equal to the change in kinetic energy, we can set up the equation 5F J = 15 J and solve for F. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we find that F = 3 N.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N. \n\n(C) 3 N",

When light waves reflect off two different interfaces, such as the air-oil interface and the oil-water interface in this case, interference occurs.\n\nThe thickness of the oil layer is given as 500 nm. We know that the wavelength of light in air is longer than the wavelength of light in a medium with a higher refractive index. Therefore, the wavelength of light in the oil layer will be shorter than 500 nm.\n\nTo determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to consider the conditions for constructive interference. Constructive interference occurs when the path difference between the two reflected waves is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\nThe path difference can be calculated using the formula:\nPath difference = 2 * refractive index * thickness * cos(angle of incidence)\n\nSince the angle of incidence is not given, we can assume it to be zero degrees, which means the light is incident normally. Therefore, the cos(angle of incidence) will be 1.\n\nUsing the given refractive indices and thickness, we can calculate the path difference for each wavelength option.\n\nFor option (A) 500 nm:\nPath difference = 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm * 1 = 1500 nm\n\nFor option (B) 550 nm:\nPath difference = 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm * 1 = 1650 nm\n\nFor option (C) 600 nm:\nPath difference = 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm * 1 = 1800 nm\n\nFor option (D) 650 nm:\nPath difference = 2 * 1.5 * 500 nm * 1 = 1950 nm\n\nThe most strongly reflected wavelength will be the one that results in the smallest path difference, as this will lead to constructive interference.\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is (A) 500 nm.",
