            "model_answer": "To translate the statement \"Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian\" into predicate logic, we need to represent the individuals and the property of being Egyptian.\n\nLet's assign the variable \"a\" to represent Abdul and the variable \"c\" to represent Cleopatra. We can use the predicate \"E(x)\" to represent the property of being Egyptian.\n\nNow, let's break down the original statement:\n\n1. Abdul is Egyptian: E(a)\n2. Cleopatra is Egyptian: E(c)\n\nTo represent both statements together, we can use the logical operator \"and\" (\u2227) to connect them:\n\nE(a) \u2227 E(c)\n\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\n\n(A) Ea \u2022 Ec: This answer choice uses the wrong logical operator. It uses a dot (\u2022) instead of the correct operator (\u2227).\n\n(B) Ea \u2022 c: This answer choice is incorrect because it does not represent the property of being Egyptian for both Abdul and Cleopatra. It only represents that Abdul is Egyptian (E(a)) and that Cleopatra is represented by the variable \"c\".\n\n(C) Ae \u2228 Ce: This answer choice uses the wrong logical operator. It uses a \"\u2228\" (or) instead of the correct operator (\u2227).\n\n(D) Ex \u2022 Ey: This answer choice is incorrect because it uses the wrong variables. It uses \"x\" and \"y\" instead of \"a\" and \"c\" to represent Abdul and Cleopatra.\n\nBased on our reasoning, the correct translation into predicate logic is:\n\nE(a) \u2227 E(c)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

Since there are four variables, there will be 2^4 = 16 rows in the truth table.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth value of each proposition in the set based on the truth values of the variables.
