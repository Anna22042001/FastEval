            "question": "An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?\n\n(A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",

However, it does not consider any other factors or potential negligence on the part of the developer.\n\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved: This option acknowledges that the developer cannot be held liable solely based on the removal of support. It suggests that negligence needs to be proven for the developer to be held liable.\n\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support: This option states that once a building is constructed on the land, the owner cannot claim the right of lateral support. However, this does not consider the potential negligence of the developer or any other legal factors.\n\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisfy all local, state, and federal safety regulations: This option suggests that the developer's only obligation was to meet safety regulations. It does not consider the potential liability for damages caused by the developer's actions.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer is:\n\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.",

            "question": "An incumbent was running for re-election as the mayor of a city. During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\n(B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n(C) inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\n(D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",

The opponent's statement about the mayor propositioning a prostitute is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. This is considered hearsay.\n\n2. Hearsay is generally not admissible in court unless it falls within a recognized exception.\n\n3. The television correspondent's testimony is based on her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech. It is not the opponent's statement itself, but rather her interpretation and memory of it.\n\n4. The notebook entry made by the television correspondent is a record of her recollection, but it is not the best evidence. The best evidence would be the actual statement made by the opponent.\n\n5. The fact that the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity does not automatically make her testimony admissible. It may be relevant to establish her credibility, but it does not address the issue of hearsay.\n\nBased on these considerations, the television correspondent's testimony would be inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",

They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway.

Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\n(A) No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\n(B) No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\n(C) Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\n(D) Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.",

The rancher acquired title to a 200-acre tract in a rural area in July 1990.\n2. In 1997, the rancher conveyed the 200-acre tract to their uncle for a consideration of one dollar.\n3. The conveyance was made \"to my uncle, his heirs, and assigns, but if my uncle's wife dies without issue, to my personal assistant and her heirs and assigns.\"\n4.

A defeasible fee simple is an ownership interest that can be terminated if certain conditions are not met. However, the scenario does not provide any information about conditions or limitations on the uncle's ownership interest. Therefore, this answer choice is not supported by the facts.\n\n(B) The personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract.\n- This answer choice suggests that the personal assistant has no legal interest in the 200-acre tract and, therefore, no right to an accounting or injunction. The scenario states that if the uncle's wife dies without issue, the property goes to the personal assistant. This indicates that the personal assistant has a contingent interest in the property. Therefore, this answer choice is not supported by the facts.\n\n(C) There was no showing that the uncle acted in bad faith.\n- This answer choice suggests that the uncle's actions are relevant to the decision. Bad faith refers to dishonesty or a lack of fair dealing. The scenario does not provide any information about the uncle's intentions or whether he acted in bad faith. Therefore, this answer choice is not supported by the facts.\n\n(D) The right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n- This answer choice suggests that the uncle's right to remove oil is connected to his right to possess the property. In general, the right to remove oil is considered an incident of ownership and possession of the land. Since the uncle acquired title to the 200-acre tract, he has the right to possess the property and, therefore, the right to remove oil. The personal assistant's contingent interest does not grant her the right to possess the property or control the uncle's activities. Therefore, this answer choice is supported by the facts.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is (D).",

However, in this case, there is no mention of any unforeseen circumstances or frustration of purpose. Therefore, this answer choice is not applicable.\n\n(B) No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\n- This answer choice suggests that for a contract to be valid, the parties must agree on essential terms. In this case, the client asked for the attorney's opinion, and the attorney provided it along with a bill for their services. This can be seen as an implied agreement between the parties. Therefore, this answer choice is not correct.\n\n(C) Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.\n- This answer choice suggests that the attorney took action based on the client's note, which resulted in a detriment to the attorney. The attorney reviewed the document, provided their opinion, and sent a bill for their services. If the client refuses to pay, it can be argued that the attorney suffered a detriment. Therefore, this answer choice is a possible contender.\n\n(D) Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n- This answer choice suggests that an implied-in-fact contract was created based on the client's note and the attorney's performance.
