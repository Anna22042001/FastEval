            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature, we need to consider the physiological responses that help regulate body temperature.\n\n1. Decreasing salt retention: When the environmental temperature increases, the body may increase sweating to cool down. Sweating helps regulate body temperature by evaporative cooling. However, decreasing salt retention is not a direct response to increased environmental temperature.\n\n2. Increasing respiration rate: When the body is exposed to higher temperatures, it may increase respiration rate to facilitate heat loss through exhaled air. This helps cool down the body by increasing the evaporative surface area. Increasing respiration rate is a possible response to increased environmental temperature.\n\n3. Increasing heart rate: In response to increased environmental temperature, the body may increase heart rate to enhance blood circulation. This can help distribute heat more efficiently throughout the body and facilitate heat loss through the skin. Increasing heart rate is a possible response to increased environmental temperature.\n\n4. Increasing water lost through the skin: When the body is exposed to higher temperatures, it may increase sweating to cool down. Sweating helps regulate body temperature by evaporative cooling. Increasing water lost through the skin is a direct response to increased environmental temperature.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) increasing water lost through skin",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understanding the question\nThe question is asking about the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation. We need to determine what happens to lactate once it leaves the muscle.\n\nStep 2: Lactate production in muscles\nLactate is produced in muscles during intense exercise or when there is insufficient oxygen supply to meet the energy demands of the muscle cells. This process is known as anaerobic glycolysis.\n\nStep 3: Fate of lactate leaving muscle\nOnce lactate leaves the muscle, it can be metabolized or processed in different ways by various organs and tissues in the body. We need to determine the main fate of lactate.\n\nStep 4: Conversion to urea in the liver\nUrea is a waste product formed in the liver as a result of protein metabolism. While the liver plays a role in lactate metabolism, lactate is not converted to urea in the liver. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nStep 5: Conversion to glucose in the heart\nGlucose is the primary source of energy for most cells in the body. While the heart can use lactate as an energy source during certain conditions, lactate is not converted to glucose in the heart. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.\n\nStep 6: Excretion via the kidneys\nThe kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and excreting them in the urine. While lactate can be excreted via the kidneys to some extent, it is not the main fate of lactate leaving the muscle. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.\n\nStep 7: Uptake and oxidation by other tissues\nLactate can be taken up by other tissues, such as the liver, heart, and brain, and oxidized to produce energy. This is the main fate of lactate that leaves the muscle and enters the circulation. Therefore, option (D) is correct.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, not the transcription of DNA.\n\n(B) Transcription does not occur in the cytosol. The cytosol is the fluid portion of the cell, and while some steps of protein synthesis occur in the cytosol, transcription takes place in a specific location within the cell.\n\n(C) Transcription occurs in the nucleus. The nucleus is the control center of the cell and contains the DNA. Transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, and this process occurs in the nucleus.\n\n(D) Transcription does not only occur during cell division.

According to the base pairing rules, adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T) and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C).\n\n3. Since the base pairing is specific (A with T and G with C), the number of purines (A and G) should be equal to the number of pyrimidines (C and T) in a double stranded DNA molecule.\n\n4. This means that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is always 1:1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) always 1:1.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which molecule will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, we need to understand the different metabolic pathways and their dependence on oxygen.\n\n1. Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate is an intermediate molecule in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). This cycle occurs in the mitochondria and is dependent on oxygen. Without oxygen, the citric acid cycle cannot proceed, and therefore, oxaloacetate production will stop.\n\n2. Pyruvate: Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm. Glycolysis does not directly require oxygen, so pyruvate production can continue even in the absence of oxygen. However, under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is further metabolized in the mitochondria through the citric acid cycle. Since the citric acid cycle requires oxygen, pyruvate production will eventually stop when oxygen is no longer supplied.\n\n3. Water: Water is not directly produced in any metabolic pathway. It is a byproduct of cellular respiration, specifically the electron transport chain (ETC) in the mitochondria. The ETC is the final step of aerobic respiration and requires oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Without oxygen, the ETC cannot function properly, and water production will cease.\n\n4. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP): ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is produced through various metabolic pathways. While ATP production is closely linked to oxygen availability, it can still be generated through anaerobic processes such as glycolysis and fermentation. Therefore, ATP production can continue for a short period even without oxygen.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is:\n\n(A) Oxaloacetate",

However, this statement does not provide any information about the changes in blood lactate concentration throughout the game.\n\n(B) is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half: This statement suggests that the blood lactate concentration tends to decrease from the end of the first half to the end of the game.

ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a molecule that stores and releases energy in cells. It is often referred to as the \"energy currency\" of the cell.\n\n2. During intense exercise, ATP is rapidly broken down to release energy for muscle contraction. However, the amount of ATP stored in the muscles is limited and can be quickly depleted.\n\n3. Phosphocreatine (PCr) is another high-energy molecule that can be rapidly broken down to produce ATP. It acts as a backup energy source when ATP levels are low.\n\n4.
