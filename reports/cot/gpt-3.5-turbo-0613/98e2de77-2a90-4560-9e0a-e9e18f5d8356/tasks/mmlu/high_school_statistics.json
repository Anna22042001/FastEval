            "question": "The director of a local food bank asks for data on all donations given during the month of November. Of the 100 checks received, the average donation is $155 with a standard deviation of $32. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement?\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155.\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of average, standard deviation, and confidence interval.\n\n1. Average: The average donation is the sum of all donations divided by the number of donations. In this case, the average donation is $155.\n\n2. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the data. A larger standard deviation indicates more variability in the donations. In this case, the standard deviation is $32.\n\n3. Confidence Interval: A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter. In this case, we want to estimate the average donation in November.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155.\nThis statement is true based on the given information. The average donation is indeed $155.\n\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\nWe cannot determine this based on the given information. The average donation does not provide information about the distribution of donations.\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\nThis statement is plausible because it mentions a confidence interval. To determine if it is correct, we need to calculate the confidence interval using the average and standard deviation.\n\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula:\nConfidence Interval = Average \u00b1 (Z * Standard Deviation / \u221an)\n\nWhere Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case), and n is the sample size (100 in this case).\n\nUsing a Z-score table or calculator, we find that the Z-score for a 95% confidence level is approximately 1.96.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nConfidence Interval = $155 \u00b1 (1.96 * $32 / \u221a100)\nConfidence Interval = $155 \u00b1 $6.27\nConfidence Interval \u2248 $148.73 to $161.27\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect. The correct confidence interval is approximately $148.73 to $161.27, not $91 to $219.\n\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\nThis statement is correct based on the calculation of the confidence interval in the previous step.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators.

Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statistic the teachers' union would be most likely to quote during negotiations, we need to consider the information given in the scenario.\n\n1. The teachers want more money, indicating that they are concerned about their own salaries.\n2. The district claims budget constraints and wants to pay as little as possible.\n3. The district has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators.\n\nGiven this information, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote a statistic that represents the typical salary of the teachers, rather than the overall average or range of salaries. This is because they want to emphasize the need for higher salaries for the majority of teachers who are moderately paid.\n\nNow let's consider each option:\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries: This statistic would take into account the salaries of both teachers and administrators. However, since the district has a few highly paid administrators, the mean would be skewed towards the higher end. The teachers' union would be less likely to quote this statistic because it does not accurately represent the typical salary of the teachers.\n\n(B) The mode of all the salaries: The mode represents the most frequently occurring salary. Since the district has a large number of moderately paid teachers, it is possible that there is a salary that occurs more frequently than others. The teachers' union may quote this statistic to highlight the typical salary of the teachers.\n\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries: The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the salaries. While this statistic provides useful information about the range of salaries, it may not be the most relevant for the teachers' union's argument for higher salaries.\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries: The median represents the middle value when the salaries are arranged in ascending order. This statistic is not affected by extreme values, such as the highly paid administrators. The teachers' union would be most likely to quote this statistic because it represents the typical salary of the teachers.\n\nTherefore, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

The \u03c72 test is based on the assumption that the expected values in each cell of the table are reasonably large. A common rule of thumb is that the expected value should be at least 5 for each cell.\n\nStatement II: In order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\n- This statement is false. The number of degrees of freedom required for a \u03c72 test depends on the size of the table. For a one-way table, the degrees of freedom is equal to the number of categories minus 1. For a two-way table, the degrees of freedom is equal to (number of rows - 1) multiplied by (number of columns - 1). There is no minimum requirement of 2 degrees of freedom.\n\nStatement III: In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.\n- This statement is true. In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, there are 4 rows and 2 columns. The degrees of freedom for a two-way table is calculated as (number of rows - 1) multiplied by (number of columns - 1).
