In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).\n\nThe given DNA strand is 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032. To find the complementary sequence, we need to replace each base with its complementary base.\n\nThe first base is C, which pairs with G. So, the first base in the complementary sequence is G.\n\nThe second base is G, which pairs with C. So, the second base in the complementary sequence is C.\n\nThe third base is A, which pairs with T. So, the third base in the complementary sequence is T.\n\nThe fourth base is T, which pairs with A. So, the fourth base in the complementary sequence is A.\n\nThe fifth base is T, which pairs with A. So, the fifth base in the complementary sequence is A.\n\nThe sixth base is G, which pairs with C.

This could be a benefit as it helps plants survive in harsh conditions.\n\n(B) They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.\nThis option suggests that mycorrhizal fungi fix nitrogen, which is important for plants in habitats where nitrogen is limited. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth, so this could be a benefit.\n\n(C) They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\nThis option suggests that mycorrhizal fungi provide plants with access to phosphorus, which is limited in many soils. Phosphorus is another essential nutrient for plant growth, so this could be a benefit.\n\n(D) They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.\nThis option suggests that mycorrhizal fungi provide plants with carbon in exchange for fixed nitrogen. This could be a benefit as it helps plants obtain the necessary carbon for energy.\n\nBased on the evaluation of each option, it appears that all of them could be benefits provided by mycorrhizal fungi. However, we need to select the option that is specifically mentioned as a benefit in the question.\n\nThe benefit that mycorrhizal fungi confer to many plants is that they provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is correct, we need to evaluate each statement one by one.\n\nStatement (A) states that the Golgi apparatus is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. The cis face of the Golgi apparatus is the side that is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum, and the trans face is the side that is farthest from the endoplasmic reticulum. This statement is correct.\n\nStatement (B) states that the Golgi apparatus is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. Secretory vesicles are small membrane-bound vesicles that transport proteins and other molecules from the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane for secretion. This statement is correct.\n\nStatement (C) states that the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are continuous with one another. The Golgi apparatus is composed of a series of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. These cisternae are indeed continuous with one another, allowing for the movement of molecules through the Golgi apparatus. This statement is correct.\n\nStatement (D) states that glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into the Golgi apparatus lumen. Glycosylation is the process of adding sugar molecules to proteins, and it typically occurs in the Golgi apparatus. However, glycosylation actually occurs after the protein enters the Golgi apparatus lumen, not prior to entry. This statement is incorrect.\n\nBased on our evaluation, statements (A), (B), and (C) are correct, while statement (D) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement concerning the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote is (C).",

A zygote is the fertilized egg, which is the first cell of a new individual.\n\nStep 4: The second sperm in double fertilization unites with the polar nuclei. The polar nuclei are two nuclei located in the central cell of the female gametophyte.\n\nStep 5: The union of the second sperm and the polar nuclei initiates the formation of something. This means that it starts a process or development.\n\nStep 6: The options given are (A) megagametophyte, (B) endodermis, (C) embryo, and (D) endosperm.\n\nStep 7: The megagametophyte is the female gametophyte, which is the structure that contains the egg cell and the polar nuclei. However, the megagametophyte is already present before fertilization occurs, so it is not initiated by the second sperm.\n\nStep 8: The endodermis is a layer of cells in the root that controls the movement of water and nutrients. It is not related to double fertilization.\n\nStep 9: The embryo is the developing plant inside the seed.

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Irreversibly forming covalent links with the enzyme, effectively preventing the enzyme's dissociation from it: This option suggests that the competitive inhibitor forms covalent bonds with the enzyme, permanently preventing the enzyme from dissociating. However, competitive inhibitors are typically reversible, meaning they can bind and unbind from the enzyme. Therefore, option (A) is unlikely to be correct.\n\n(B) Irreversibly modifying some of the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site: This option suggests that the competitive inhibitor modifies the amino acid residues in the enzyme's active site, which would prevent the substrate from binding. However, competitive inhibitors typically do not irreversibly modify the enzyme. They bind reversibly and can be displaced by increasing the concentration of the substrate. Therefore, option (B) is unlikely to be correct.\n\n(C) Competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site: This option suggests that the competitive inhibitor competes with the substrate for binding to the enzyme but at a different site. This is the characteristic behavior of a competitive inhibitor. It binds reversibly to the enzyme, competing with the substrate for the active site. Therefore, option (C) is a plausible answer.\n\n(D) Reversibly decreasing the number of enzyme molecules that are available to bind substrates: This option suggests that the competitive inhibitor reversibly decreases the number of enzyme molecules available for substrate binding. However, competitive inhibitors do not directly affect the number of enzyme molecules. They simply compete with the substrate for binding to the enzyme. Therefore, option (D) is unlikely to be correct.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible answer is (C) competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the options is NOT affected by antibiotics that affect bacterial cells, we need to consider the mechanisms of action of antibiotics.\n\n(A) Peptidoglycan synthesis: Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells can interfere with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is a major component of the bacterial cell wall. This disruption weakens the cell wall and can lead to cell lysis. Therefore, peptidoglycan synthesis can be affected by antibiotics.\n\n(B) Protein synthesis: Many antibiotics target the ribosomes in bacterial cells, which are responsible for protein synthesis. By binding to the ribosomes, antibiotics can inhibit protein synthesis and disrupt bacterial growth. Therefore, protein synthesis can be affected by antibiotics.\n\n(C) DNA synthesis: Some antibiotics can interfere with the replication of bacterial DNA. By targeting enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, these antibiotics can prevent the bacteria from replicating their genetic material. Therefore, DNA synthesis can be affected by antibiotics.\n\n(D) Reverse transcriptase: Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme found in retroviruses, not bacterial cells. It is responsible for the synthesis of DNA from RNA. Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells do not target reverse transcriptase because it is not present in bacteria.
