This is because the instructions can be processed faster, allowing more instructions to be executed in a given time frame.\n\nII. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline:\n- Forwarding in the pipeline allows data to be passed directly from one stage to another without waiting for it to be written to memory and then read again.

The memory for these variables is fixed and does not change during program execution.\n\nStack-based allocation, on the other hand, refers to the allocation of memory for variables at runtime. The memory for these variables is allocated on the stack, which is a region of memory that grows and shrinks as functions are called and return.\n\nNow let's analyze each of the language features:\n\n(A) Recursive procedures:\nRecursive procedures are functions or procedures that call themselves. Each time a recursive call is made, a new instance of the function is created, and its local variables are allocated on the stack. Since the number of recursive calls can vary, stack-based storage allocation is required to handle the dynamic allocation of memory.\n\n(B) Arbitrary goto's:\nGoto statements allow for unconditional jumps to different parts of the code. While goto statements can be used to jump to different sections of the code, they do not inherently require stack-based storage allocation. The allocation of memory for variables in this case can still be done statically.\n\n(C) Two-dimensional arrays:\nTwo-dimensional arrays are arrays with two dimensions, typically represented as rows and columns. The memory for two-dimensional arrays can be allocated statically, as the size of the array is known at compile-time. Therefore, stack-based storage allocation is not required for two-dimensional arrays.\n\n(D) Integer-valued functions:\nInteger-valued functions are functions that return an integer value.

If condition codes are set by every instruction, it means that the pipeline would need to wait for the outcome of each instruction before proceeding to the next one. This would introduce dependencies and potentially stall the pipeline. Therefore, condition codes set by every instruction can be considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.\n\n(B) Variable-length encoding of instructions: \nVariable-length encoding means that instructions can have different lengths. This can make it more challenging to fetch and decode instructions in a pipelined architecture. However, modern processors have techniques to handle variable-length instructions efficiently, such as using instruction caches and branch prediction. While it adds complexity, variable-length encoding is not generally considered a significant obstacle to aggressive pipelining.\n\n(C) Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute: \nIf instructions require widely varying numbers of cycles to execute, it means that the pipeline stages would need to be adjusted dynamically to accommodate the longest instruction. This can lead to inefficiencies and potential pipeline stalls. Therefore, instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can be considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining.\n\n(D) Several different classes (sets) of registers: \nHaving several different classes or sets of registers does not necessarily impact pipelining directly. Registers are used for temporary storage of data during instruction execution, and the number of registers or their classification does not inherently affect the pipelining process.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the instruction-set feature that is NOT generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining of an integer unit is (D) Several different classes (sets) of registers.\n\nAnswer: (D)",
