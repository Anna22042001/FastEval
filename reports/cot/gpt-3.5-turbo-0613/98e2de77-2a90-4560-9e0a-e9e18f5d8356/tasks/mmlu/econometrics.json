Non-normality refers to the departure of the distribution of residuals from a normal distribution. Residual non-normality can indicate that the assumptions of the regression model are violated.\n\n2. Potential solutions:\n   (A) Use a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one: This solution suggests transforming the variables in the regression model using a logarithmic function. Logarithmic transformations can help address non-linear relationships between variables and potentially improve the normality of residuals.\n   (B) Add lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model: This solution involves including lagged values of the independent variables in the regression model. Adding lags can capture the temporal dependencies in the data and potentially improve the normality of residuals.\n   (C) Estimate the model in first differenced form: This solution suggests differencing the variables in the regression model. Differencing can remove trends and seasonality in the data, which can contribute to non-normality in residuals.\n   (D) Remove any large outliers from the data: This solution involves identifying and removing extreme values (outliers) from the dataset.

We are given four statements labeled (A), (B), (C), and (D) to choose from.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate statement (A).\nStatement (A) claims that mean squared error is usually highly correlated with trading rule profitability. Mean squared error is a measure of the average squared difference between the forecasted values and the actual values. Trading rule profitability, on the other hand, refers to the ability to make profitable trades based on the forecasts. There is no inherent correlation between mean squared error and trading rule profitability. Therefore, statement (A) is false.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate statement (B).\nStatement (B) states that mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function. Mean absolute error is a measure of the average absolute difference between the forecasted values and the actual values. A quadratic loss function, however, penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller errors. Mean absolute error does not have this property, as it treats all errors equally. Therefore, statement (B) is false.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate statement (C).\nStatement (C) suggests that mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts. Mean absolute percentage error is a measure of the average absolute percentage difference between the forecasted values and the actual values. It is commonly used in forecasting to assess the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, statement (C) is true.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate statement (D).\nStatement (D) claims that mean squared error penalizes large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors. Mean squared error does indeed penalize larger errors more heavily than smaller errors because it squares the differences between the forecasted values and the actual values. Therefore, statement (D) is true.\n\nStep 6: Determine the correct statement.\nBased on the evaluations in steps 2-5, we have found that statement (C) and statement (D) are both true.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

Significance level: The significance level, denoted by \u03b1, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It represents the maximum allowable probability of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true). In this case, the significance level is 5%.\n\n2. Power: The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It represents the ability of the test to detect a true alternative hypothesis. The power is influenced by factors such as the sample size, effect size, and significance level.\n\n3. Tail rejection regions: In a hypothesis test, the rejection region is the set of values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is rejected.

The GARCH(1,1) model is not specifically designed to capture fat tails, as it assumes a normal distribution for the returns. Therefore, this feature cannot be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model.\n\nii) Leverage effects: Leverage effects refer to the phenomenon where negative returns have a larger impact on volatility than positive returns of the same magnitude. The GARCH(1,1) model is capable of capturing leverage effects, as it allows for the conditional variance to be influenced by both positive and negative returns. Therefore, this feature can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model.\n\niii) Volatility clustering: Volatility clustering refers to the tendency of high volatility periods to be followed by high volatility periods and low volatility periods to be followed by low volatility periods. The GARCH(1,1) model is specifically designed to capture volatility clustering, as it includes an autoregressive term that captures the persistence of volatility. Therefore, this feature can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model.\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns: Volatility affecting returns refers to the phenomenon where changes in volatility have an impact on future returns.

Including lagged values of the dependent variable in a regression equation is known as an autoregressive model.\n2. Autoregressive models are commonly used when there is a time series relationship between the dependent variable and its lagged values.\n3. However, including lagged values of the dependent variable can introduce endogeneity into the regression model.\n4. Endogeneity occurs when the independent variables are correlated with the error term in the regression equation.\n5. In the case of including lagged values of the dependent variable, the error term will be correlated with the lagged values themselves.\n6. This correlation violates the assumption of exogeneity, which states that the independent variables are not correlated with the error term.\n7. When endogeneity is present, the coefficient estimates become biased and inconsistent.\n8. Biased means that the estimated coefficients do not accurately reflect the true population coefficients.\n9. Inconsistent means that the estimated coefficients do not converge to the true population coefficients as the sample size increases.\n10.
