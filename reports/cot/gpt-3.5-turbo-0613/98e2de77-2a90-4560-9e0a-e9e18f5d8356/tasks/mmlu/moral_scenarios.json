            "model_answer": "To determine which scenario, if any, involves the main character doing something morally wrong, we need to analyze each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character fills the patron's cup with regular coffee instead of decaf because they knew he preferred decaf. This action can be seen as a deception or a violation of the patron's preferences. However, it is important to consider whether the act of filling the cup with regular coffee is considered morally wrong in ordinary moral standards. In general, it is not considered morally wrong to provide someone with regular coffee instead of decaf, unless there are specific circumstances or agreements that make it morally wrong. Therefore, Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character hands their brother the toilet brush so he can clean his teeth. This action can be seen as unhygienic and potentially harmful to the brother's health. In ordinary moral standards, it is generally considered morally wrong to use a toilet brush for any purpose other than cleaning the toilet. Therefore, Scenario 2 involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong",

According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, infidelity is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I copied and pasted so I could write my paper with sources found on the internet.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character is engaging in plagiarism by copying and pasting sources from the internet without proper attribution. Plagiarism is widely regarded as morally wrong and a violation of academic integrity.\n\nBased on the analysis of each scenario, both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (A) Wrong, Wrong",

While it may not be the most conventional way to store popcorn, it does not seem to be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I consoled my sick and helpless dog after he vomited on the carpet.\" This action involves showing care and compassion towards a sick and helpless animal. Providing comfort and support to a pet in distress is generally considered morally right and aligns with ordinary moral standards.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be concluded that Scenario 1 does not involve the main character doing something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not involve the main character doing something morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

From an ordinary moral standpoint, this action can be considered morally wrong as it violates the principle of respecting others' property and boundaries.\n\nScenario 2: \"I shop for cheap items at the Salvation Army because I know the money goes to a good cause.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character shops for inexpensive items at the Salvation Army, knowing that the money spent goes towards supporting a good cause. From an ordinary moral standpoint, this action is not considered morally wrong. In fact, it can be seen as a positive action since it contributes to a charitable organization and helps those in need.\n\nBased on the analysis, the main character does something morally wrong in Scenario 1 but not in Scenario 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong",

Reading someone else's Bible without their permission is generally not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. People often read religious texts out of curiosity or to gain knowledge about different beliefs. Therefore, the main character's action in Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character discovers that their toddler has peed on the hotel mattress. Instead of ignoring the situation or leaving without informing anyone, the main character decides to turn that information in before they leave. This action demonstrates a sense of responsibility and consideration for others. It is generally considered morally right to take responsibility for one's actions and to inform others when something has been damaged or soiled. Therefore, the main character's action in Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nBased on the analysis of both scenarios, the main character does not do something clearly morally wrong in either scenario.

In the US, it is generally considered morally acceptable to report a crime and seek help from law enforcement when one's property is being violated. Therefore, the main character's action of calling the cops on the stranger does not appear to be morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"As my parents laid in bed, I went to their safe deposit box.\"\nIn this scenario, the main character goes to their parents' safe deposit box while they are in bed. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the main character's intentions or the nature of their relationship with their parents. However, in general, accessing someone else's safe deposit box without their permission or a legal right to do so would likely be considered morally wrong. It is important to respect others' privacy and property rights. Therefore, the main character's action of going to their parents' safe deposit box could be morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in Scenario 2, while their action in Scenario 1 does not appear to be morally wrong.\n\nThe answer is: (C) Not wrong, Wrong",
