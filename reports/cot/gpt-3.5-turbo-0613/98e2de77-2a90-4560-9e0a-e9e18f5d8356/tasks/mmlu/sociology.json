            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze each statement and determine if it is supported by the study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978.\n\nStatement (A) claims that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. To determine if this statement is supported by the study, we need to look for evidence that links women's susceptibility to stress with their levels of social support in the study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978.\n\nStatement (B) states that self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. To determine if this statement is supported by the study, we need to look for evidence that shows higher levels of self-reported depression among men and the relatively affluent in the study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978.\n\nStatement (C) suggests that men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. To determine if this statement is supported by the study, we need to look for evidence that indicates similar levels of diagnosed depression between men and women in the study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978.\n\nStatement (D) claims that men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. To determine if this statement is supported by the study, we need to look for evidence that links men's vulnerability to depression with conventional gender roles in the study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978.\n\nNow, let's analyze the study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978 to determine which statements are supported.\n\nThe study conducted by Brown & Harris in 1978 focused on the relationship between social factors and depression in women. They found that women's susceptibility to depression was influenced by their levels of social support. This supports statement (A) that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.\n\nHowever, the study did not specifically address self-reported depression among men and the relatively affluent, so statement (B) cannot be supported.\n\nThe study did not provide specific data on diagnosed depression levels between men and women, so statement (C) cannot be supported.\n\nThe study did not specifically address men's vulnerability to depression due to conventional gender roles, so statement (D) cannot be supported.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement supported by the study is (A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.\n\nAnswer: A",

This fits the definition of a new form of community as it is formed based on a shared identity and experiences.\n\nOption (B) mentions gay villages, which are formed in certain parts of large cities. This also fits the definition of a new form of community as it is a specific community formed by individuals with a shared sexual orientation.\n\nOption (C) refers to sociological communities formed by unpopular lecturers. This is an interesting option, but it does not fit the definition of a new form of community. Sociological communities formed by unpopular lecturers are not commonly recognized as a distinct form of community.\n\nOption (D) mentions virtual communities that exist only in cyberspace. This also fits the definition of a new form of community as it is a community formed online, where individuals interact and share common interests or goals.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) is the one that is not identified as a new form of community.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

This option does not align with the embourgeoisement thesis, as it implies a shift in power within the capitalist class rather than a transformation of the working class.\n\n(B) The option suggests that the affluent working class is adopting middle-class values and ways of life. This aligns with the embourgeoisement thesis, as it implies a blurring of the boundaries between the working class and the middle class.\n\n(C) The option suggests that white-collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace. This option does not align with the embourgeoisement thesis, as it focuses on changes in the nature of work rather than changes in class structure.\n\n(D) The option suggests that the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes. This option does not align with the embourgeoisement thesis, as it implies a complete dissolution of social classes, which is not the main idea behind the thesis.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (B) is the most accurate representation of the embourgeoisement thesis, as it captures the idea of the working class adopting middle-class values and ways of life.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

We are then asked to identify the missing ideal type.\n\nTo do this, we can eliminate options (C) effective and (D) infected, as they do not fit the context of the question. \n\nThis leaves us with options (A) affectual and (B) affective. Both words are similar in meaning and can be used interchangeably in some contexts. However, to determine the correct answer, we need to consider the language used in the question.\n\nThe question asks for the missing ideal type of social action that Weber identified.

This option implies that men who have undergone a personal transformation or change in their attitudes towards gender roles may be more likely to contribute more to housework. However, this option is based on a subjective assumption and lacks concrete evidence.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when their wives were at home and nagged them all the time. This option implies that men are more likely to do housework when they are constantly reminded or pressured by their wives. However, this option relies on a negative stereotype and assumes that nagging is an effective motivator for men to do housework.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented. This option implies that the introduction of time-saving and convenient household appliances may have increased men's participation in housework. This option aligns with the idea that technological advancements can influence gender roles and responsibilities.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time. This option implies that men may take on more housework when they have more free time due to unemployment or when both partners are equally occupied with work. This option suggests that the division of household chores may be influenced by the availability of time and the distribution of work responsibilities.\n\nBased on the analysis, option (C) seems to be the most plausible answer as it aligns with the idea that the introduction of time-saving gadgets can influence men's participation in housework.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

While exploitation is certainly a factor in class dynamics, it does not encompass the entirety of Weber's definition.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a 'class situation' is a social group's consciousness of their status and life chances.

This aligns with the core principles of feminist theory, which aim to understand and challenge gender inequalities. It is a plausible interpretation of the term.\n\n(C) The recognition of difference and diversity in women's lives: This option suggests that the term 'feminist standpoint' involves acknowledging and valuing the diverse experiences and perspectives of women.

Therefore, it is generally recommended to avoid asking short questions in a survey.\n\n(C) Leading questions: Leading questions are worded in a way that suggests a particular answer or influences respondents' opinions. They can introduce bias and lead to inaccurate or skewed results. To maintain objectivity and obtain unbiased responses, it is generally recommended to avoid asking leading questions in a survey.\n\n(D) Funnelled questions: Funnelled questions are a series of questions that progressively narrow down the scope or specificity of the topic.
