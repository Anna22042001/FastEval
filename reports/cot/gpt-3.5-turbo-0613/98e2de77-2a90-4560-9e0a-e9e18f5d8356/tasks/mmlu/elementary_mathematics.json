Since 68 is closer to 70 than 60, we round it up to 70.\nStep 3: Multiply the rounded numbers together: 30 x 70 = 2100.\n\nTherefore, the product of 32 x 68 is approximately 2100.\n\nThe product is between 1,800 and 2,800.

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement about the values of the digits in the distance is true, we need to analyze the place value of each digit.\n\nThe distance between Miriam's house and Debbie's house is given as 444.44 meters. Let's break down the place value of each digit:\n\n- The first 4 is in the hundreds place.\n- The second 4 is in the tens place.\n- The third 4 is in the ones place.\n- The fourth 4 is in the tenths place.\n- The fifth 4 is in the hundredths place.\n\nNow let's evaluate each statement:\n\n(A) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to compare the place values. The tenths place is one place to the right of the tens place. In the decimal system, moving one place to the right means dividing by 10. Therefore, the value of the 4 in the tenths place is indeed 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n\n(B) The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to compare the place values. The hundredths place is two places to the right of the ones place. In the decimal system, moving two places to the right means dividing by 100. Therefore, the value of the 4 in the hundredths place is indeed 1/100 (not 1/10) the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n\n(C) The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to compare the place values. The hundreds place is two places to the left of the ones place. In the decimal system, moving two places to the left means multiplying by 100. Therefore, the value of the 4 in the hundreds place is indeed 100 (not 10) times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\n\n(D) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to compare the place values. The tenths place is one place to the left of the hundredths place. In the decimal system, moving one place to the left means multiplying by 10. Therefore, the value of the 4 in the tenths place is indeed 10 (not 1/10) times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\n\nBased on our analysis, the only statement that is true is (A) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",
