            "model_answer": "To find a movie similar to The Lion King, The Fugitive, Schindler's List, and The Shawshank Redemption, we need to consider the genre, themes, and/or storytelling elements of these movies. \n\nStarting with The Lion King, it is an animated film that tells a coming-of-age story, features talking animals, and has a strong emphasis on family and the circle of life. \n\nMoving on to The Fugitive, it is a suspenseful thriller that follows a man on the run, wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit. It involves a cat-and-mouse chase, investigation, and suspenseful moments. \n\nSchindler's List is a historical drama set during World War II and the Holocaust. It tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved over a thousand Jews from being deported to concentration camps. It is a powerful and emotionally charged film.\n\nLastly, The Shawshank Redemption is a drama set in a prison and follows the story of a man wrongly convicted of murder and his experiences inside the prison walls.
