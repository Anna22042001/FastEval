The phrase \"You are right\" is often used sarcastically to convey the opposite meaning. In this case, the sarcasm is directed towards the idea that someone should let their assailants go unpunished.

However, the use of the phrase \"totally different\" suggests that the speaker may not genuinely believe the two actions to be completely distinct. This could be a hint of sarcasm.\n\nStatement B says, \"He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; totally different.\" Similar to Statement A, this statement compares pleading and threatening and emphasizes their supposed difference. Again, the use of the phrase \"totally different\" could indicate sarcasm, suggesting that the speaker does not think the two actions are genuinely distinct.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two statements side by side. Both statements use the same structure and emphasize the difference between two actions. However, since sarcasm often involves the intention of mocking or expressing the opposite of what is stated, we can identify the sarcastic statement by considering which action is more commonly associated with sarcasm.\n\nIn general, threatening someone is often associated with sarcasm, as sarcastic remarks can sometimes be veiled threats or expressions of disapproval. On the other hand, pleading is not typically associated with sarcasm.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sarcastic statement is likely Statement A, which suggests that urging and threatening are \"totally different\" when the speaker may not genuinely believe that to be the case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A)",
