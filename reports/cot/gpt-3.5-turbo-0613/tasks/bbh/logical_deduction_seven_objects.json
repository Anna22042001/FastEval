In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.\nOptions:\n(A) Ana finished third\n(B) Eve finished third\n(C) Ada finished third\n(D) Dan finished third\n(E) Rob finished third\n(F) Amy finished third\n(G) Joe finished third",

Dan finished third.\nSince Dan finished third, we can eliminate the options (A), (B), (C), (E), (F), and (G) because they do not involve Dan finishing in the third position.\n\n2. Ana finished above Ada.\nThis statement does not provide any information about who finished third, so it does not help us eliminate any options.\n\n3. Amy finished last.\nSince Amy finished last, she cannot be the one finishing third. We can eliminate option (F) - Amy finished third.\n\n4. Dan finished below Rob.\nThis statement is consistent with option (B) - Eve finished third. However, since we haven't considered all the statements yet, we should continue analyzing.\n\n5. Eve finished below Ada.\nThis statement is consistent with option (C) - Ada finished third. However, since we haven't considered all the statements yet, we should continue analyzing.\n\n6. Rob finished below Joe.\nThis statement is consistent with option (G) - Joe finished third. However, since we haven't considered all the statements yet, we should continue analyzing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining options: (B), (C), and (G).\n\nIf option (B) - Eve finished third is true, then the order would be:\n1. Amy\n2. Dan\n3. Eve\n4. Ada\n5. Ana\n6. Rob\n7. Joe\n\nIf option (C) - Ada finished third is true, then the order would be:\n1. Amy\n2. Dan\n3. Ada\n4. Eve\n5. Ana\n6. Rob\n7.

The kiwis are the third-cheapest.\n\nTo determine the third-most expensive fruit, we need to find the fruit that falls in the middle when arranged in order from cheapest to most expensive.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that watermelons are the cheapest. This means watermelons will be at the beginning of the arrangement.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that peaches are more expensive than mangoes. This means mangoes will come before peaches in the arrangement.\n\nFrom statement 3, we know that cantaloupes are the second-most expensive. So, the arrangement so far is: watermelons, mangoes, cantaloupes.\n\nFrom statement 4, we know that oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes. So, the arrangement now becomes: watermelons, mangoes, cantaloupes, oranges.\n\nFrom statement 5, we know that peaches are less expensive than plums. So, the arrangement now becomes: watermelons, mangoes, cantaloupes, oranges, peaches, plums.\n\nFrom statement 6, we know that kiwis are the third-cheapest. So, the final arrangement is: watermelons, mangoes, kiwis, cantaloupes, oranges, peaches, plums.\n\nFrom the arrangement, we can conclude that the third-most expensive fruit is (C) The peaches are the third-most expensive.",
