In the translated sentence, however, Charles Borromeo is translated as Karl. Karl is a German equivalent of Charles, but Karl Borrom\u00e4us is not a proper Germanized variant for Charles Borromeo.\nModifiers or Adjectives (A) pertain to the way that nouns and pronouns are described (i.e. adjectives) or grouped together into phrases (i.e. modifiers). The error here is that the nouns are not being correctly modified  or grouped together, with F\u00fcrst (meaning prince) being replaced by Karl.

(F) Facts is also unlikely since the word \"oberbayerische\" was swapped with \"mainland\" in the translation which can be considered to be a significant inaccuracy.\nThat leaves us with the options (B) Numerical values or (E) Dropped Content. However in this case if \"mainland\" meant for example \"island\" then \"mainland\" certainly is a numerical contrast to \"island\", since \"island\" is derived from the word insula which means \"not connected to the mainland\". That leaves us with (E) Dropped Content. This error classification is further supported by the fact that the text mentions \"baudenkm\u00e4ler\" which translates to \"monuments\" but in the translation only \"architectural monuments\" is used.
