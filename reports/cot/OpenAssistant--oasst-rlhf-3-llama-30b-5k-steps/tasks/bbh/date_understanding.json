Looking at the options, we can eliminate option A and B immediately, since the current date cannot be earlier than August 2010.\n5.

Since she ran out of eggs, we know that she must have eaten the last egg on May 9th, 2017.\n3. Therefore, we must first find the number of days between February 9th, 2017 (when the year first day was on a Thursday, like the year 2017) and May 9th, 2017 (which is a Tuesday).\n4. Counting the days between the two dates shows that there are 63 days.\n5. Since Jane eats an egg per day, we can subtract those 63 days from the total number of days in the year.\n6. However, we must remember to also subtract the 64 days in February from the total number of days in the year (28/31) *365, because February is part of the year, but there are less days in it.\n7. Subtracting 63 days from 365, or 366 in a leap year (whereas this problem states, \"2017, the \"year first day was on a Thursday,\" so it's not a leap year), we get the answer, \"7/30/2017.\"\n8.

If we are to assume that each month has 30 or 31 days, then either (3|5)4 or 365 days make little sense, because there are many numbers greater than 31 that divide 354 and many numbers less than 365 that divide 365, but there are no numbers greater than 31 that divide both 365 and 354.

May 6, 1992 was ten years ago, which means it was in the year 1992 - 10 = 1982.\nSo, we need to find the current date from the options, that is closest to 1982.\nLet's start by removing the options which are obviously not close to 1982:\n\n* (A) 05/06/2095: way too far in the future\n* (B) 05/06/1935: too far in the past\n\nThis leaves us with options D, E and F.\nWe also know that from the year 2002, the current year 2022 is only 18 years ahead, not ten. So D, E and F are all closer to the current date than to 1982.\nTherefore the answer must be one of D, E or F.\nBut we still can't determine which one is exactly right.\nHowever, we also know that May 6, 1992 is \"like yesterday to Jane\".\nThus, Jane must have been born close to 1992 or may be still alive today.\nIf we choose the closest option from the three, D which has a date in August, it seems unlikely that Jane must have been born in August, because that would mean she had her birthday in the yesterday, which is not a very common occurance.\nOption E seems to be a more likely candidate than D, as May is arguably a more popular month for births than August. Option F's year of 1964 is too far from our target year for it to be a good candidate.\nSo the most likely option among",
