At the start of the semester, they each buy one new book: Alice gets The Great Gatsby, Bob gets Frankenstein, and Claire gets Ulysses.\nAs the semester proceeds, they start trading around the new books. First, Alice and Claire swap books. Then, Bob and Claire swap books. Finally, Claire and Alice swap books. At the end of the semester, Alice has\nOptions:\n(A) The Great Gatsby\n(B) Frankenstein\n(C) Ulysses",

She instead takes a new one, which Alice and Bob now want.\n\nTherefore, there are only two possible end results:\n\nEither Alice gets Frankenstein, Bob gets Ulysses and Claire gets The Great Gatsby. Since Alice previously had that, the answer is not (A).\nOr, Alice gets Ulysses, Bob gets The Great Gatsby and Claire gets Frankenstein. In that scenario, Alice got her initial Great Gatsby returned to her. Thus, the answer is (A) in final iteration.",
