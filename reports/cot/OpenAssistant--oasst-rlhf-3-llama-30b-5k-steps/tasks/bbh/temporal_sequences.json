To find out when Betty could have gone to the art show, we need to consider their other activities.\nWe know that:\nBetty woke up at 8am,\nElizabeth saw Betty buying lunch at the deli from 8am to 10am,\nTiffany saw Betty fixing their computer at the electronic store from 10am to 1pm,\nSusan saw Betty taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm,\nBetty saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe from 7pm to 10pm,\nand the art show was closed after 10pm.\n3. We eliminate the times when Betty was doing other activities as possible times for the art show. The remaining options are:\nA) 8am to 10am: eliminated because Elizabeth saw Betty during this time.\nB) 10am to 3pm: eliminated because Tiffany saw Betty during this time and the art show was closed after 10pm.\nC) 3pm to 7pm: eliminated because Susan saw Betty at the Eiffel Tower during this time.\nD) 10pm to 11pm: eliminated because Betty saw Betty getting a coffee at the cafe during this time.\n4. The remaining possible times are:\n(E) 8am to 3pm\n(F) 3pm to 7pm\n(G) 8pm to 10pm\nIn step 2, we found that Betty was doing other activities during the times listed in alternatives E, F, and G.

Between 5am and 11am, Leslie could have gone to the clothing store before heading to the airport. And between 7am and 6pm, there is a window of time where Leslie could have gone to the clothing store after leaving the electronics store.\n\nFinally, between 6pm and 10pm, there is a window of time when Leslie could have gone to the clothing store after attending class.\n\nOption A is incorrect because we know Leslie was at the airport during that time. Option B is incorrect because we know Leslie was at the electronics store during that time. Option C is incorrect because we know Leslie was at the airport during that time. Option D is actually the correct answer because there is a window of time between 6pm and 10pm when Leslie could have gone to the clothing store after attending class.\n\nAnswer: (D) 6pm to 10pm",

            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "To determine the time frame within which Jessica could have gone to the basketball court, we start by considering the time when Michael saw her shopping at the mall: 5am to 6am.\n\nThis means that Jessica was definitely awake and active before 6am, which rules out any time after 6am as a possibility for her to go to the basketball court.\n\nNext, we consider the time when Steven saw her buying a bike: 6am to 7am.\n\nSince Jessica was able to buy a bike within an hour, it is likely that she was already awake and active before 6am. This means that any time after 6am would also rule out the possibility of Jessica going to the basketball court.\n\nThe train station sighting narrows down the time even further. If Sean saw Jessica from 7am to 2pm, this means that she could not have arrived at the basketball court before 2pm.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower sighting confirms this, since Elizabeth saw her taking photos until 6pm. This means that any time between 2pm and 6pm is ruled out for Jessica to go to the basketball court.\n\nFinally, we consider the last sighting of Jessica walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 6pm to 9pm. This means that any time after 6pm is also ruled out for her to go to the basketball court since it would not be safe for her to travel across the city and still make it to the gym within the remaining time frame.\n\nThe final time frame for Jessica to go to the basketball court includes the time between her activities, which excludes any time between 6pm and 10pm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 5am to 6am.
