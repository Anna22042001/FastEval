            "model_answer": "(A) 12 Angry Men is similar to Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Braveheart, and The Usual Suspects in that it features strong acting performances and deals with themes of justice, morality, and personal sacrifice. The film also has a small, claustrophobic setting, and explores difficult moral questions that force characters to examine their beliefs and values.\n(B) Mo' Better Blues is a Spike Lee film that is known for exploring the lives of musicians and their struggles. While it is not as similar as 12 Angry Men, it still explores themes of personal sacrifice and is character driven.\n(C) Mindhunters is different in tone than the other options, as it is a horror/thriller film. It does not explore deep themes and is not character driven.\n(D) Shawshank Redemption is similar to 12 Angry Men in its themes of hope, personal sacrifice, and exploration of the human spirit. The film boasts a great acting performance by Tim Robbins and is memorable due to its ending.\n\nSo, the answer is: (A) 12 Angry Men.\n\nNote: The reasons for choosing 12 Angry Men over The Shawshank Redemption are not due to quality but due to the closer match in tone and themes to the other three choices whereas The Shawshank Redemption is quite different from Pulp Fiction. It could be a fifth option on its own. 12 Angry Men is closer to these three in general.
