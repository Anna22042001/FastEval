It's possible that the statement is sarcastic, but without additional context, we cannot be certain.\n\nIn (B), the speaker presents the individual as \"a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\" This statement contains a contradiction; if the individual's actions raised millions for a charity stream, that suggests that the person must have done something right.

Sarcasm is a witty way of saying words that convey the opposite of the message that they actually state, often with the intent of criticizing someone.\n3.

If the alternatives were actually choices,\nthe sarcasm would be less likely as people would be able to connect to the idea that height is charm.\nThere is less sarcasm in \"at six feet, he must be wonderful\" because \"at six feet\" gives more reason whereas \"being over six feet\" is a very low standard, perhaps being an average height. It is a more outrageous sarcasm but still true sarcasm.\nThe use of \"over six feet\" and \"must be\" betrays discontent about what must be the case. He must be tall, he must be tall, he doesn't have to be anything else. If the speaker said it, that is sarcasm: he is satirizing height. In other words he is saying you only matter if you are tall. Sarcasm and satire can be mistaken so I have to make the point that the sarcasm does not come from being six feet tall but of \"must be something by itself\".\nThere are better examples of sarcasm.
