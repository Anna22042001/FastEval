We need to determine which penguin is the oldest based on the information in the table.\n\nWe know that the age of a penguin is equal to the number of years that have passed since its birth. As each new year passes, the age increases by 1. The age of a penguin is a positive integer.\n\nTo determine which penguin is the oldest among the choices provided, we can compare the ages that are listed in the table.\n\n(A) Louis is listed as 7 years old, which is less than (B) Bernard, who is listed as 5 years old. Therefore, Louis is not the oldest penguin.\n\n(B) Bernard is listed as 5 years old, which is less than (A) Louis. At this point, we have eliminated both Louis and Bernard as the oldest penguin.\n\n(C) Vincent is listed as 9 years old, which is more than either Louis or Bernard. Therefore, Vincent cannot be the oldest penguin.\n\n(D) Gwen is listed as 8 years old, which is less than Vincent.\n\n(E) James is listed as 12 years old, which is more than Vincent and Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the oldest penguin is (E) James, who is 12 years old. The answer is a single letter, \"E.\"\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this question requires the reader to analyze the information in the table and compare the ages of the penguins to select the oldest one.

Identify the elements of the table that are names (e.g. \"Louis\", \"Bernard\", etc.) and those that are not (e.g. \"7\", \"80\", etc.) by considering their positions in the table and their relationships with each other. You may discover that the names are the headers of each column except for the last column, which is the name itself.\n2. Identify the names of the penguins with the lowest and highest values in terms of age, height and weight, respectively. For example, you may discover that \"Louis\" has the lowest value in terms of age and that \"Gwen\" has the highest value in terms of weight, but \"Bernard\" has the largest value in terms of height.\n3. Select the name of the row that has the lowest value among those that has the lowest value, or the second lowest value if tied. For example, you may select \"Louis\" because it has the least number of values among the rows with the lowest values of age, height and weight, so it's the best choice for the penguin.\n4. Check if the row you selected has the lowest or second lowest value on each column of the table. For example, you may check if the age of \"Louis\" is smaller than that of any other penguin, and you may find that \"Louis\" has the lowest age among all the penguins.\n5. If the row you selected still has the lowest or second lowest value in all the columns, then you may have found the penguin you are looking for. Otherwise, continue checking the other rows that satisfy the conditions mentioned above until you find the penguin you are looking for.\n6.

To start, we need to look at the heights of all the penguins.\n\nThe heights of the penguins in the table are: 50, 80, 60, 70, 90, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.\n\nTo find the average, we add up all the heights and divide by the number of penguins. The sum of the heights is 450. The number of penguins is 4.\n\n450/4=112.5. But we need to round this number to the nearest whole number, since heights cannot be split in half.\n\nHere are the possible numbers that could be rounded up to based on the given options:\n112.5 (A) 113 would round up to 12.\n112.5 (B) 114 would round up to 12.\n112.5 (C) 114 would round up to 13.\n112.5 (D) 114 would round up to 12.\n112.5 (E) 114 would round up to 13.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 70.

I need to find out which penguin is the youngest based on the table provided.\n\nMy next step is to look at the information in the table and see if there is anything that stands out that could help me answer the question. I notice that there is a column for each penguin's age.\n\nMy next step is to examine the ages of each penguin. I notice that the youngest penguin listed is Louis, whose age is 7. This tells me that the answer is either (A) Louis or (E) James, as those are the only options that include Louis as a possible answer.\n\nHowever, since the task states that we delete the penguin named Bernard from the table, I should re-examine the ages to see if James is still the youngest penguin. After deleting Bernard's row, I see that Louis is still the youngest penguin with age 7. Since James is not included among the options, I conclude it must refer to Louis.\n\n(A) Louis is the youngest penguin, so my answer will be \"A\".\n(A) Louis is the youngest penguin. There is no penguin named James in the table, so my final step is to output the answer using only a single letter with parentheses.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: (A) Louis.\n\nPlease note that this procedure can take time for you do to the reasoning, if you have doubts, feel free to ask any question, also, this procedure is done to provide an explanation step-by-step, if you want me to not do the step-by-step procedure and just give the answer, I can do that.",
