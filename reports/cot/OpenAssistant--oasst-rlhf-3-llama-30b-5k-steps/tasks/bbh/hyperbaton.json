            "model_answer": "I would choose option (B) midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat.\nThe reasoning behind this choice is that I adhere to the norm of adjective order as grey, Mexican and rubber could be considered a sub-modifiying phrase, while the combination of midsize and walking function more like a sub-modifying phrase for the noun phrase \"cat\", but since walking does not modify an object, it is grammatically incorect for it to be placed before the determiner \"midsize\". I would then apply the general rule that goes from the general to the specific, in order from left to right: first element, then adjective (grey), then determiner (midsize) then submodifier (walking). Thus the order is from left to right grey, midsize, walking and finally the noun, which is cat.\n\n(B) midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat.\n\nThis answer might be disputed and is certainly open to another interpretation, but should give an idea of the process I would follow in answering the question.",

            "model_answer": "A) Because \"big smoking mysterious Indian iron motorcycle\" is the correct version, the answer is A.\n\nReasoning:\nIn English adjectives are generally placed so that adjectives which describe a noun's appearance are placed before functional or descriptive adjectives.\nSo when we start from the first appearance adjective that is \"mysterious\" it should be placed after the origin or country of motorcycle that is \"India\" or \"Indian\" so the answer is A.

This is likely to be a regional language phenomenon. In most circumstances, adjectives will be placed before the item they are modifying a noun. \nHowever, I will acknowledge that there is a possible alternative to this order depending upon the interpretation. Thus, there might be some ambiguity here for which option is correct depending upon the intended meaning. However, given the limited context provided I cannot make any assumptions about the intended meaning without additional information about the source text. \nTherefore, of the available options, (B) rectangular cloth smoking motorcycle is the best answer.
