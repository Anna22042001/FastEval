Both films portray characters who use their intelligence and cunning to achieve their goals, often relying on their relationships with others to gain their trust.\n\nIn \"Forrest Gump,\" Forrest is helped by his friends and neighbors, including his stepfather, who provides him with guidance and support. Similarly, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" features a smart and resourceful detective, FBI agent Lecter, who partners with a brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. Lecter, to solve a murder case.\n\nAnother similarity between the two movies is the use of the setting as a character. \"Forrest Gump\" is set in the 1960s, a time when America was going through a significant cultural and political change. Similarly, \"The Silence of the Lambs\" is set in the 1980s, a time when America was struggling with several significant social and political issues, such as crime, drugs, and censorship.\n\nIn both movies, the atmosphere and setting play a major role in the story. \"Forrest Gump\" takes place in a small town where life is simple and idyllic, while \"The Silence of the Lambs\" takes place in a high-security mental hospital where intense and secretive activities take place.\n\nOverall, while \"Forrest Gump\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs\" are different films with their own unique stories and characters, they both engage in the same kind of psychological manipulation and use the setting as a character to achieve their objectives.",

Soze is a cool, calculated criminal who leaves no witnesses and always seems to know exactly what he's doing.\n\nThe film's themes of justice and morality are mirrored in The Fugitive, where FBI agent Jack Malone is trying to track down a fugitive criminal who has evaded capture for over 20 years. Like Roth, Malone is determined to bring the criminal to justice, even if it means breaking the law.\n\nThe film Pulp Fiction has a similar theme of violence and criminality, as well as a strong sense of style and attitude. The main character, John 'Jules' Eccles, is a cool and sardonic criminal who is always one step ahead of his pursuers.\n\nFinally, Terminator 2 Judgment Day is known for its intense action scenes and strong themes of technology and genetics.
