To answer this question step-by-step, we first need to determine which animals are included in the list of giraffes.\n\nSince the list includes only giraffes, we can eliminate (B), (C), and (D). That leaves us with (A), (E), and (A) + (B) + (C).\n\nTo check whether giraffes are more than 5 years old, we can look at the age of the giraffe. In the first table, the age of Louis is 7, the age of Bernard is 5, and the age of Vincent is 9. If we add the ages of these three giraffes, we get 14, which is more than 5 years old. Therefore, (A) + (B) + (C) is the answer.",

We then use that row number to determine the corresponding column number (i.e., the age, weight, height, or name column), and then we use that column number to delete the corresponding value in the table. \n\nFor example, if we want to delete the penguin named Bernard from the table, we would first identify the row number of Bernard (which would be 9). We would then look up the age of Bernard in the age column (which would be 9), and then we would delete the value in the age column associated with Bernard (i.e., 11). \n\nTherefore, after deleting Bernard, the table would look like this:\n\nname, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n\nNow, to determine the number of penguins in the table, we simply subtract the number of penguins we removed (i.e., Bernard) from the total number of penguins in the table (i.e., 16). \n\nTherefore, the number of penguins in the table is equal to 16 - 1 = 15.",
