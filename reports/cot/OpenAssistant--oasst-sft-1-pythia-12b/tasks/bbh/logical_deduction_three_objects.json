Ada finished second, so it can be deduced that Ada is better than Mel. Similarly, Ana finished second, which implies that Ana is better than Ada. Therefore, Ada and Ana are in a tie for second place.\n\nNext, I compared Ada and Ana to Mel. Ada finished second, while Mel finished last. Therefore, Ada is better than Mel. Ana finished second, while Mel finished last. Hence, Ana is better than Mel.\n\nFinally, I combined Ada and Ana together to form a new set of objects, called Team Ana. Team Ana includes Ada and Ana, who are tied for second place. Therefore, Team Ana is also tied for second place. It follows that Mel finished last, which is the correct answer.",
