Richard saw Leslie between 7am and 8am, so the earliest option for when Richard could have seen Leslie walk to the garden would be between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.\n\nNext, we can look at the times when Leslie saw Richard. On the morning of March 6th, she saw Richard between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM, so the earliest option for when Leslie could have seen Richard would be between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.\n\nFinally, we can look at the times when Jason, Samantha, and Linda saw Leslie. On the morning of March 8th, she saw Samantha between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM, so the earliest option for when Leslie could have seen Samantha would be between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. On the afternoon of March 8th, she saw Jason between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, so the earliest option for when Leslie could have seen Jason would be between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM. And on the evening of March 8th, she saw Linda between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM, so the earliest option for when Leslie could have seen Linda would be between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM.\n\nBased on these calculations, we can say with certainty that Leslie went to the orchestra hall between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM on March 8th, as that is the earliest possible timeframe that all four people could have seen her in the garden, seen Richard in the morning, seen Samantha in the afternoon, and seen Linda in the evening.",
