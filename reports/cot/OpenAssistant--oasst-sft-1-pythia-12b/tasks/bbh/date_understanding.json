Therefore, there are six full days between today and tomorrow.\n\nStep 3: Divide the number of days by the number of days in a month.\n6 divided by 12 is half. Therefore, tomorrow's date will be a week from today's date.\n\nStep 4: Convert the week number to a month and day.\nIf tomorrow is a week from today, then tomorrow is a Sunday. Therefore, tomorrow's date will be the 12th of December.\n\nStep 5: Convert the day of the week to a string.\nSunday = 0, Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, Wednesday = 3, Thursday = 4, Friday = 5, Saturday = 6.\n\nStep 6: Convert the month and day to a two-digit number.\nThe month will be December, and the day will be the 12th.

We can use the date function in Excel to do this: =date(2014,4,19).\n\n2. Add one week to this value. We can do this by adding the number seven to the value: =date(2014,4,19)+7.\n\n3. Convert the sum to a date value. We can do this using the date function again: =date(2014,4,26).\n\n4. Find the day of the week that the date falls on. We can do this using the day of the week function: =day(date(2014,4,26)).\n\n5. Convert the day of the week to a numerical value. We can do this using the modulo function: =mod(day(date(2014,4,26)),7)=1.\n\n6. Add the day of the week to the numerical value of the date one week from today. We can do this by adding the number one to the value: =date(2014,4,26)+1.\n\n7. Convert the result to a string. We can do this using the TEXT function: =text(date(2014,4,26)+1,\"MM/DD/YYYY\").\n\n8. Add the parentheses and the single letter to the result. We can do this using the LEFT and RIGHT functions: =LEFT(text(date(2014,4,26)+1,\"MM/DD/YYYY\"),2)=(\"19\"&RIGHT(text(date(2014,4,26)+1,\"MM/DD/YYYY\"),2))\n\n9.

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to know what the current time is. The current time in 5/4/2004 is 3:02 PM.\n\nTo find one year ago from today, we need to minus the current time by one year. So, one year ago from today is March 4, 2004, which is denoted by (M), or (3)/4.\n\nNow we need to convert the date to a month, date, and year format. To do this, we can use the date functions in Python. The `month()` function will return the current month, and the `date()` function will return the current day. Finally, the `year()` function will return the current year.\n\nSo, March 4, 2004 is denoted by `(3) / 4` and `(M)`, or `03/04`.\n\nFinally, we just need to format the date in the desired format. We can do this with the `str.format()` method, which takes a `string`, `formatting info`, and `args`. In this case, we want to format the date as a month, date, and year, which can be specified as `'MMM d, YYYY'`.\n\nSo, the final answer is `'MMM d, YYYY'`.",
