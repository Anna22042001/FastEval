Because \"walking\" comes before \" Mexican\", it is the correct adjective order.\n\nHowever, it may be possible to identify a more specific pattern of correct adjective order.

The rule for adjective order is called the \" nominative case order rule\" and it says that theNominal Case adjectives come before the In Determining Order adjectives.\n\nIn this sentence, the Nominal Case \"mysterious\" comes before the In Determining Order \"big\".
