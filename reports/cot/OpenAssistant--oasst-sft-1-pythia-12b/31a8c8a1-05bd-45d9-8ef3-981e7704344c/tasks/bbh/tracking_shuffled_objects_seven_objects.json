In this case, the directed graph is formed by the books that the friends have traded.\n\nWe can start by identifying the vertices of the graph. There are five vertices: Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve. We can also identify the edges of the graph. There are six edges: Alice-Bob, Bob-Claire, Bob-Dave, Dave-Claire, Dave-Eve, and Eve-Alice.\n\nNext, we can use the transitive reduction algorithm to find a minimal set of edges that connects all the vertices. This set of edges will form a spanning tree of the graph. In this case, the spanning tree is formed by the edges: Alice-Bob, Bob-Claire, Bob-Dave, Dave-Claire, Dave-Eve, and Eve-Alice.\n\nThe final step is to look at the books that each friend has traded. We can use this information to determine which book is the most common among the friends. In this case, the most common book is Moby Dick, as it is traded by all five friends.",
