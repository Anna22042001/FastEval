In the sentence, \"they\" is used to refer to the designers and the carpenter, who are collaborating on a project. The blueprint is a document that the designers and the carpenter will use to create the project.\n\nBased on the context of the sentence and the role of \"they,\" we can conclude that \"they\" refers to the designers and the carpenter.
