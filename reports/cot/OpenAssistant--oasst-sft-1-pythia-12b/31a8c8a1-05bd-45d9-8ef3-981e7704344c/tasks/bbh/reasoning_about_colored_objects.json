These objects include the mauve cat toy, the purple cat toy, the grey cat toy, the mauve notebook, the grey notebook, the burgundy cat toy, and the purple notebook.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of objects in each group.

In the second group, there are two purple notebooks and three grey notebooks, for a total of four objects. In the third group, there are two mauve notebooks and three burgundy cat toys, for a total of three objects.\n\nFinally, we need to add up the number of objects in each group to determine the total number of objects remaining on the floor after removing the notebooks. The total number of objects in the first group is six + four = 10. The total number of objects in the second group is three + four = 7.
