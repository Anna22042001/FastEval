The diameter of a circle with a radius of 25.26 is 26.13.\n\n(B) heptagon: The path element is a heptagon, so the length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the seven sides of the heptagon. The length of each side is 7.14, so the total length of the path is 14.28.\n\n(C) hexagon: The path element is a hexagon, so the length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the six sides of the hexagon. The length of each side is 6.56, so the total length of the path is 12.72.\n\n(D) kite: The path element is a kite, so the length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the four sides of the kite. The length of each side is 7.14, so the total length of the path is 14.28.\n\n(E) line: The path element is a line, so the length of the path is the length of the line. The length of the line connecting the two points (25.26,65.86) and (39.41,66.15) is 39.41 - 25.26 = 14.27.\n\n(F) octagon: The path element is an octagon, so the length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the eight sides of the octagon. The length of each side is 8.28, so the total length of the path is 16.56.\n\n(G) pentagon: The path element is a pentagon, so the length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the five sides of the pentagon. The length of each side is 5.56, so the total length of the path is 10.72.\n\n(H) rectangle: The path element is a rectangle, so the length of the path is the length of one of the four sides of the rectangle. The length of one side of the rectangle is 25.26, so the total length of the path is 25.26.\n\n(I) sector: The path element is a sector, so the length of the path is the length of one of the four sides of the sector. The length of one side of the sector is 7.14, so the total length of the path is 14.28.\n\n(J) triangle: The path element is a triangle, so the length of the path is the length of one of the three sides of the triangle. The length of one side of the triangle is 7.14, so the total length of the path is 14.28.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",
