            "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is \"res ipsa loquitur.\"\n\nThe Latin phrase \"res ipse loquitur\" means \"the thing itself speaks\" or \"the thing itself shows.\" This legal concept applies when a specific injury or harm is caused by an event or condition that is so unusual or unlikely to occur that it suggests negligence on the part of the person responsible for the event.\n\nIn the case of the patient with the surgical sponge in her pelvis, the fact that the sponge was left behind after a surgical procedure is highly unusual and suggests that there was negligence on the part of the medical team. This is because the presence of a foreign object in the body is a serious and potentially life-threatening event, and it is highly unlikely that it would occur without someone's negligence.\n\nTherefore, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, the patient can establish negligence on the part of the medical team by showing that the presence of the surgical sponge in her body was an unusual and unexpected event that could only have been caused by negligence.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nIBS is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation or diarrhea. The exact cause of IBS is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including genetics, stress, diet, and the microbiome.\n\nThe patient's diet and bowel habits can be important factors in the diagnosis of IBS. She reports being a picky eater, which could be a contributing factor to her constipation. Additionally, a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or family history of IBS could also be contributing factors.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of IBS, a comprehensive medical evaluation, including a physical examination, laboratory tests, and a gastrointestinal evaluation, is necessary.

Additionally, adjusting the patient's medication regimen may also be necessary to manage her underlying medical conditions. Warfarin therapy is not recommended in this patient population due to the risk of bleeding.

The symptoms of B-CLL can vary depending on the severity of the disease and the age of the patient. Some common symptoms of B-CLL include fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and a decreased ability to fight infections.\n\nThe laboratory findings in a patient with B-CLL include a low white blood cell count, which is typically between 4.5 and 11.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL. The percentage of mature-appearing B cells in the blood can also be elevated, which is typically between 70 and 97%.
