The initial potential energy of the spring is equal to its final kinetic energy after the mass has passed through its equilibrium position.\n\nThe initial potential energy is given by:\n\nU = mgh, where m is the mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the mass above the table.\n\nThe final kinetic energy is given by:\n\nK = (1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the mass after it has passed through its equilibrium position.\n\nSetting U = K, we have:\n\nmgh = (1/2)mv^2\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2gh)\n\nSo the total mechanical energy of the system is equal to:\n\nU = mgh = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)sqrt(2gh)mv^2\n\n= (1/2)mv^2 = 0.48 mJ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D (0.75 mJ).",

When white light is incident on the water/oil interface, it will be reflected at a different angle depending on the index of refraction of the material it encounters.\n\nThe wavelength of light that is reflected will be the same as the wavelength of light that is incident, plus or minus a small amount depending on the index of refraction of the material.
