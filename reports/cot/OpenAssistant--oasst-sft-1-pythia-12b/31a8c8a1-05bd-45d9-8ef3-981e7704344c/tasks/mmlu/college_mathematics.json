            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the work done by the force F on the particle. The work done by a force F on a particle is given by the formula W = F * d, where d is the distance that the particle travels.\n\nIn this case, the particle will travel along the path given by (t, t^2, t^3). To calculate the distance that the particle travels, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. The length of the path can be calculated as follows:\n\nd = sqrt(t^2 + t^3)\n\nNow, we can calculate the work done by the force F on the particle. The force F is parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1), so we can write it as F = k * (-1, 0, 1).\n\nThe work done by the force F on the particle can be calculated as follows:\n\nW = F * d = k * (-1, 0, 1) * sqrt(t^2 + t^3) = -k * t^2\n\nNow, we can compare the work done by the force F to the potential energy of the particle. The potential energy of the particle is given by:\n\nU = mg * h, where m is the mass of the particle, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the particle.\n\nThe work done by the force F on the particle is negative, so the potential energy of the particle must also be negative. This means that the particle is experiencing a net force that is pushing it upward, and it will continue to move upward until it reaches a height h that satisfies U = 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nThe work done by the force F on the particle is -k * t^2, where k is a constant unit force that is parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1) in xyz-space.\n\nNote that the answer can also be expressed as W = -k * d^2, where d is the distance that the particle travels. This form of the answer is more useful when working with vectors and matrices, as it allows for a more compact representation of the work done by the force.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the method of intersecting circles. We can start by finding the equation of the circle that passes through the point (1, 4). This circle will have the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = r^2\n\nwhere r is the radius of the circle.\n\nWe can then find the equation of the parabola that passes through the point (1, 4). This equation is:\n\ny = -4\n\nWe can then use the point-circle intersection formula to find the number of points of intersection between the circle and the parabola. This formula is:\n\nn = (x - x_1) * (x - x_2) * (y - y_1) * (y - y_2) / (r^2 - (x_2 - x_1)^2)\n\nwhere (x_1, y_1) is the point of intersection on the circle, (x_2, y_2) is the point of intersection on the parabola, and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nApplying the formula to our problem, we get:\n\nn = (1 - 1) * (1 - 2) * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) / (9 - (2 - 1)^2)\nn = 4 * 4 * 9 / (16 - 4^2)\nn = 16\n\nTherefore, the number of points of intersection between the circle and the parabola is 16. This means that the circle with the greatest number of points of intersection with the parabola is the circle with the equation:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 16\n\nNote that this is just one way of solving the problem.
