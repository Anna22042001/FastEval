            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"D\".\n\nThe reason is that \"diastema\" is a Greek word that means \"gap\" or \"split\", which is a common feature of the mandible, where two bones meet at a point but do not form a complete joint. The mandible is a complex structure that plays a crucial role in chewing and speaking, and having a forward-thrusting lower face is necessary for these functions.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **C**.\n\nThe Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes, which allowed for a more efficient production of tools and weapons. This shift was made possible by the development of new techniques for flaking stone, such as the use of a core tool to shape the flake and the use of a hammerstone to strike the flake. This technology also allowed for the production of more intricate and precise tools, such as the spear points and arrowheads produced by the Levallois culture.\n\nIn contrast, the production of pottery and clothing remained important aspects of the Levallois technology throughout the period, as they provided a means of storing and transporting food and other resources. The use of pottery also allowed for the creation of more elaborate and durable artifacts, such as the pottery vessels used for cooking and storage.\n\nIn conclusion, the Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes, which allowed for a more efficient production of tools and weapons. This shift was made possible by the development of new techniques for flaking stone, as well as the continued importance of pottery and clothing in the Levallois culture.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **C**. Primateology is the study of primates, which are the closest living relatives of humans. This field aims to better understand the biology, behavior, and evolution of primates, as well as their role in the ecosystem. paleoanthropology is also a subfield of anthropology, but it focuses on the study of ancient human populations, including their physical characteristics, behavior, and culture. archaeology is also a subfield of anthropology, but it focuses on the study of ancient human cultures and artifacts, rather than their biology. Finally, linguistics is a separate field that studies the structure, development, and use of language, but it is not directly related to anthropology.",

            "model_answer": "The wild progenitor of maize is likely teosinte, a species of grass that is native to Mexico and Central America. Teosinte is a close relative of maize and is thought to be the species from which maize was domesticated.\n\nTeosinte is a diploid species, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes. It is also an annual plant that grows in fields and is capable of self-pollination. This makes it an excellent candidate for the wild progenitor of maize.\n\nAnother candidate for the wild progenitor of maize is emmer, a diploid species that is also native to Mexico and Central America. Emmer is also a close relative of maize and is thought to be the species from which maize was domesticated.\n\nHowever, the exact wild progenitor of maize is not known for certain.

This period was marked by a sharp increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, which caused widespread drought and wildfires in Europe and North America. This cooling event was followed by a period of warming that allowed glaciers to expand and recede, which had a significant impact on the landscape and the lives of humans.\n\n(B) a period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago.\n\nThis is the most likely explanation for the Younger Dryas. During this time, the glaciers in Europe and North America expanded, causing widespread glacial advance and retreat. This period of glacial expansion was followed by a period of glacial retreat that allowed the glaciers to recede, which is what is seen during the Younger Dryas.\n\n(C) a period of glacial retreat between 10,900 and 9,000 years ago.\n\nThis is also a possible explanation for the Younger Dryas. During this time, the glaciers in Europe and North America began to retreat, causing the glaciers to recede and the climate to cool. This period of glacial retreat was followed by a period of warming that allowed the glaciers to expand, which is what is seen during the Younger Dryas.\n\n(D) a period of environmental change that caused humans to temporarily abandon much of northern Europe.\n\nThis is not a plausible explanation for the Younger Dryas. The Younger Dryas was a period of rapid climate change that had a significant impact on the environment and the lives of humans. It is unlikely that environmental change would have caused humans to abandon much of northern Europe during this time.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the Younger Dryas is (A), a warming period at the end of the Pleistocene.",
