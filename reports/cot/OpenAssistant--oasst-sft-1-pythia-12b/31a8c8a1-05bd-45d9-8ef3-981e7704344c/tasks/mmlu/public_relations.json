            "question": "Which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue?\n\n(A) Interpersonal\n(B) Media\n(C) Group\n(D) Public",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is interpersonal communication. Interpersonal communication involves communicating directly with individuals, rather than through media or groups, which can have a more limited impact on shaping opinions and beliefs.\n\nInterpersonal communication can be effective in changing minds because it allows individuals to hear and understand the perspectives of others, which can help them to see the issue from a different angle and develop a more nuanced understanding. It can also help individuals to form stronger relationships with those they are communicating with, which can increase the likelihood that they will be more open to hearing new perspectives and considering alternative solutions.\n\nIn contrast, media and group communication can have a more limited impact on shaping opinions and beliefs. Media messages can be easily ignored or forgotten, and group discussions can be dominated by a few vocal individuals who may not represent the views of the majority of group members. In addition, media and group communication can create a sense of community and belonging, which can be positive, but it can also lead to groupthink and a lack of critical thinking.\n\nIn conclusion, interpersonal communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue because it allows individuals to hear and understand the perspectives of others, which can help them to see the issue from a different angle and develop a more nuanced understanding. It can also help individuals to form stronger relationships with those they are communicating with, which can increase the likelihood that they will be more open to hearing new perspectives and considering alternative solutions.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The objectives of a program are typically decided at the beginning of the planning process. This is when the program team defines the specific goals and objectives of the program. This includes defining the problem or issue that the program is intended to solve and the specific outcomes that the program is expected to achieve.\n\nOnce the objectives have been defined, the program team then begins to plan the program. This involves developing a detailed plan that outlines the steps and activities that will be used to achieve the objectives. The plan should include a timeline, budget, and resource allocation.\n\nOnce the plan has been developed, the team takes action and implements the ideas. This involves putting the plan into action and making decisions about the resources that will be used to achieve the objectives. The team may also conduct evaluations to track the progress of the program and make adjustments as needed.\n\nThe final stage of the planning process is evaluation. This is where the program is evaluated to determine if it has achieved the goals and objectives set out in the plan. This evaluation may involve conducting surveys, collecting data, or conducting other research to gather information about the program's success. The results of the evaluation are used to make adjustments to the program and ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the stakeholders.",

            "model_answer": "The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented by British computer scientist and researcher Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. Berners-Lee developed the concept of a \"hypertext\" document, which is a document that can contain links to other documents, and the WWW was the first web browser that implemented this concept.\n\n Berners-Lee began working on the WWW in the late 1980s, and in 1990 he released the first version of the web browser, called \"WorldWideWeb,\" which was based on the NeXT computer platform. The browser was designed to be easy to use and was quickly adopted by the internet community.\n\nIn 1991, Berners-Lee released the second version of the web browser, called \"HTTP,\" which is the protocol that is used to communicate on the web. HTTP allowed for the creation of more sophisticated web pages, and it was a major step towards the development of the web as a universal platform for communication and information.\n\nIn 1993, Berners-Lee released the final version of the web browser, called \"Mosaic,\" which was a groundbreaking web browser that was designed to be easy to use and to support a wide range of web technologies. Mosaic was a major step towards the development of the web as a universal platform for communication and information, and it helped to establish the web as a major player in the world of online communication and information.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"When was the Web effectively invented?\" is \"In 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.\"",
