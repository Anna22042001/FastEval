            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D): 6*10^17 J.\n\nThe reason is that the volume of a cube of ice is V = L^3, where L is the length of one side of the cube. The mass of one cube of ice is m = V * density, where density is the density of ice (0.92 g/cm^3).\n\nThe energy required to melt one cube of ice is E = m * k * T, where k is the thermal conductivity of ice (0.92 W/m/K), T is the temperature of the ice (0\u00b0C), and m is the mass of one cube of ice.\n\nSetting E = 6*10^17 J, we have:\n\nm = V * density = 1.08*10^17 kg * (0.92 g/cm^3) = 1.08*10^17 J\nk = 0.92 W/m/K = 0.92 * 10^3 J/K\nT = 0\u00b0C = 0 K\n\nSetting E = 6*10^17 J and solving for V, we get:\n\nV = L^3 = 1.08*10^17 J * (10^3 m/J)^3 = 1.08*10^17 J * 10^9 m^3 = 1.08*10^17 J\n\nSo the volume of one cube of ice that would be melted is 1.08*10^17 J, which is approximately 1.4*10^21 cubic meters.\n\nThe energy required to melt 1.4*10^21 cubic meters of ice is approximately 1.4*10^21 J, which is approximately 1.4*10^24 J.\n\nSo the energy wasted by Americans each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks is approximately 1.4*10^24 J.",

They are the largest animal on earth and can produce sounds that can be heard from hundreds of miles away.\n\nBlue whales have a loud vocalization that can range from a low growl to a high-pitched whine. The sound is created by a combination of airflow and muscle contractions in the whales' throat and chest.\n\nThe blue whale's vocalization is used for communication and navigation, and can be heard by other whales, dolphins, and seals. The sound is so loud that it can be heard from deep in the ocean, and can be heard from as far as 200 miles away.\n\nIn addition to their loud vocalization, blue whales are also known for their size and color. They are a dark blue or black color on the back and a lighter blue on the belly, and can grow up to 60 feet long and weigh up to 80 tons.\n\nOverall, the blue whale is a fascinating animal that is both large and loud, and is considered one of the most important species in the ocean ecosystem.",
