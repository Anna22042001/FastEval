            "question": "An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?\n\n(A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The best comment on the investor's action to recover damages from the developer would be:\n\nC) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n\nThis comment correctly states that once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support. The right of lateral support is a common-law right that allows an owner of land to rely on the support of adjacent land to prevent the collapse of a building. However, once a building is constructed on land, the owner no longer has a right of lateral support against the building. This is because the building is now a permanent structure that is no longer supported by the ground beneath it.\n\nTherefore, in this case, the investor cannot invoke the right of lateral support against the developer's building, because the building is a permanent structure that is no longer supported by the ground beneath it. The developer is therefore not responsible for any damage to the investor's building that may have been caused by subsidence.",

            "question": "An incumbent was running for re-election as the mayor of a city. During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\n(B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n(C) inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\n(D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",

This makes the recording a business record, which is an exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nThe opponent's statement is relevant to the mayor's character and reputation, and the television correspondent's testimony is necessary to provide a full and accurate account of what was said. The notebook entry is not the best evidence, as it is an imperfect record of the conversation. The opponent's statement is also not within any recognized exception to the hearsay rule, such as the exception for statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\n\nTherefore, the television correspondent's testimony is the only appropriate way to provide a full and accurate account of what was said during the campaign speech.",

They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely\n\n(A) recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.\n(B) recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.\n(C) not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.\n(D) not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **C**.\n\nThe president of a pharmaceutical firm received a report from his testing bureau that a manufactured lot of the firm's anti-carcinoma prescription medication was well below strength. Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\nThe president's argument can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. The distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense, not a criminal one.\n2. The cancer, not the president's conduct, was the cause of death of the patient.\n\nRegarding the first part, the president is correct that distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense. This is because the distribution of prescription medication is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Drug Administration (Drug Administration). The distribution of adulterated or mislabeled drugs is a violation of the FDA's regulations and can result in significant fines and criminal penalties.\n\nHowever, the president's argument that the distribution of the defective lot was not a criminal offense does not necessarily mean that his conviction should be reversed. The president's intent in distributing the defective lot is an important factor in determining whether his conduct was criminal. If the president intended to harm the patient by distributing the defective lot, his conduct could still be considered criminal.\n\nRegarding the second part of the president's argument, the medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength. However, this does not necessarily mean that the president's conduct was the cause of death. The cause of death could have been the cancer, which was the underlying condition that required the medication to be taken in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, the president's argument that his conviction should be reversed is based on a misinterpretation of the law. Distribution of the defective lot was a criminal offense, and the president's intent in distributing the lot is an important factor in determining whether his conduct was criminal. The president's argument that the cancer, not his conduct, was the cause of death is not persuasive. Therefore, the court should not reverse the president's conviction.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the most likely answer is (C) bilateral contract.\n\nA bilateral contract is a contract in which both parties have obligations and rights. In this case, the man and woman entered into a bilateral contract in which the woman agreed to repair the man's speakers and the man agreed to pay her $20. The fact that the woman performed the repair work in her spare time does not change the nature of the contract, as the parties' obligations and rights remained the same.\n\nIn contrast, a unilateral contract is a contract in which only one party has obligations and rights. In this case, the man entered into a unilateral contract with the woman, in which the woman agreed to repair the man's speakers but the man did not agree to pay her. This type of contract is often used in situations where one party is providing a service and the other party is accepting the service without any agreement or promise to pay.\n\nA contract governed by the UCC is a contract for the sale of goods, which is typically governed by the UCC. In this case, the speakers were not goods, so the contract was not governed by the UCC.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the contract, but it is likely that it was a bilateral contract governed by the UCC.",
