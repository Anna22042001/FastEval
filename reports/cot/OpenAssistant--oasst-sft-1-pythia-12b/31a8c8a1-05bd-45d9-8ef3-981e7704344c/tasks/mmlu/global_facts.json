            "model_answer": "The global fertility rate is the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime. As of 2015, the global fertility rate was about 1.5 children per woman. This rate has been declining over the past few decades and is expected to continue to decline in the future.\n\nThe reasons for the decline in fertility rates are complex and multifaceted, but some of the main factors include:\n\n1. advances in healthcare and family planning services, which have led to increased access to reproductive healthcare and the ability to prevent and treat pregnancy-related complications\n2. changes in social and cultural norms, including increased gender equality, reduced poverty, and improved education and employment opportunities\n3. improved access to information and technology, which has allowed individuals to make informed decisions about family size and planning\n4. increased awareness of the negative environmental impacts of large family sizes, such as resource depletion and environmental degradation\n\nIt's important to note that the global fertility rate is just one measure of population growth and does not take into account differences in birth rates between different countries or regions. In addition, the decline in fertility rates is not uniform and varies by country, region, and individual.",

The economic costs of anxiety disorders are significant, as they can lead to lost productivity, increased healthcare costs, and reduced quality of life. Additionally, anxiety disorders can have a negative impact on relationships and social interactions, leading to isolation and depression.\n\nWhile there are several different types of anxiety disorders, the most prevalent is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which is characterized by excessive worry and anxiety about a variety of situations and events. Other common anxiety disorders include obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder.\n\nIt's important to note that mental disorders are complex and can have a significant impact on a person's life, and it's important for individuals to seek professional help if they are experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total population of Brazil: It is estimated to be around 209 million people.\n\n2. Calculate the number of people who used the internet in the past three months: This can be calculated by subtracting the number of people who did not use the internet from the total population. The latest data from the Brazilian government shows that there were around 77 million active internet users in Brazil in January 2021. So, we can estimate that there were around 74 million people who used the internet in the past three months.\n\n3. Divide the number of people who used the internet in the past three months by the total population: This gives us the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months. According to the data provided, this fraction is approximately 18%.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is \"A\", which represents 18% of the population in Brazil.",

            "model_answer": "The percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were obese in 2016 was estimated to be approximately 27%. This estimate was made by considering the total number of adults aged 18 years or older in the United States in 2016 and the percentage of those adults who were obese according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\nThe total number of adults aged 18 years or older in the United States in 2016 was estimated to be approximately 236 million. This estimate was based on the U.S. population of approximately 330 million people in 2016 and the assumption that the population of adults aged 18 years or older would not change significantly over the next 10 years.\n\nThe percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were obese in the United States was estimated to be approximately 32% based on the results of the NHANES. This estimate was calculated by dividing the total number of adults who were obese in the NHANES by the total number of adults aged 18 years or older in the United States, and then multiplying the result by 100.\n\nBased on these estimates, it can be concluded that about 27% of adults aged 18 years or older were obese in 2016 in the United States. This estimate is likely to change over time as the population of adults aged 18 years or older changes and as new data are collected from the NHANES.",

This can be done by dividing the number of children who reported physical punishment by teachers by the total number of children who reported any form of punishment by teachers in the past week.\n\nAccording to the data provided, there were approximately 1.3 million children who reported any form of punishment by teachers in the past week. Of these, about 8% (or about 128,000 children) reported physical punishment by teachers.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of children who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009 was about 8% (or about 128,000 children).\n\nOption A: 38%\n\nThis is the correct answer. We can verify this by dividing the number of children who reported physical punishment by teachers by the total number of children who reported any form of punishment by teachers in the past week.\n\n 128,000 / 1.3 million = 38%\n\nOption B: 58%\n\nThis is also a possible answer. We can verify this by dividing the number of children who reported physical punishment by teachers by the total number of children who reported any form of punishment by teachers in the past week.\n\n 128,000 / 1.3 million = 58%\n\nOption C: 78%\n\nThis is also a possible answer.
