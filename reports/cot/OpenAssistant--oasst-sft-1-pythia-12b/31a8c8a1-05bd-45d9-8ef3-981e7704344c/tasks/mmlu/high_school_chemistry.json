If the concentration of one of the reactants or products increases or decreases, the reaction rate will also change in response, because the reaction will become more or less favorable.\n\nIn the case of the question, the statement \"at equilibrium there are more products than reactants\" indicates that the reaction is not spontaneous, because the reaction rate would be affected by changes in the concentration of the reactants.\n\nThe statement \"the value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero\" is not a sufficient condition for spontaneity, because the value of \u0394G\u00b0 only provides information about the total energy of the system, and not about the specific changes in energy that occur during the reaction.\n\nThe statement \"the value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero\" is also not a sufficient condition for spontaneity, because the value of \u0394S\u00b0 only provides information about the total entropy of the system, and not about the specific changes in entropy that occur during the reaction.\n\nFinally, the statement \"the value of Keq is less than one\" is not a sufficient condition for spontaneity, because the value of Keq only provides information about the equilibrium constant for the reaction, and not about the specific changes in concentration that occur during the reaction.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"the value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero\" is not sufficient to indicate that a reaction is spontaneous, and the statement \"the value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero\" is not sufficient to indicate that a reaction is spontaneous.

The repulsive force is due to the electron cloud of the atoms, which tries to avoid overlap. When the attractive and repulsive forces are equal, the electrons are in a stable configuration and the atoms are held together by a strong chemical bond.\n\nIn nonmetals, the electrons are typically arranged in a sp3 hybridization, which means that they are arranged in a tetrahedron around the central atom. When the orbitals of two nonmetal atoms overlap, the electrons from the orbitals of one atom can transfer to the orbitals of the other atom, resulting in the formation of a chemical bond.\n\nIn condition (C), the attractive and repulsive forces are equal because the orbitals of the two atoms are arranged in a tetrahedron around the central atom, which results in a stable configuration.
