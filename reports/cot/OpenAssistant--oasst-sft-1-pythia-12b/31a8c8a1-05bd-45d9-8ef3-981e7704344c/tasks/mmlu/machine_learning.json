            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nThe choice of the number of hidden nodes has a significant impact on the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network. A larger number of hidden nodes can lead to a better model fit, but it can also increase the risk of overfitting.\n\nA smaller learning rate can help prevent overfitting by allowing the network to converge more quickly, but it can also lead to underfitting if the network is not trained enough.\n\nThe initial choice of weights can also affect the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. If the initial weights are too small, the network may not be able to learn the underlying patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. If the initial weights are too large, the network may overfit the data and not generalize well to new data, leading to overfitting.\n\nThe use of a constant-term unit input can also affect the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network. A constant-term unit input adds a constant input to each layer of the network, which can help prevent the network from learning any complex patterns in the data. However, a constant-term unit input can also lead to underfitting if the network is not trained enough.\n\nIn summary, the choice of the number of hidden nodes, the learning rate, the initial choice of weights, and the use of a constant-term unit input all can affect the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network, and the best choice will depend on the specific requirements of the problem and the training data.",

            "question": "You are training a linear regression model for a simple estimation task, and notice that the model is overfitting to the data. You decide to add in $\\ell_2$ regularization to penalize the weights. As you increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, what will happen to the bias and variance of the model?\n\n(A) Bias increase ; Variance increase\n(B) Bias increase ; Variance decrease\n(C) Bias decrease ; Variance increase\n(D) Bias decrease ; Variance decrease",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nThe effect of adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to a linear regression model can be understood through the concept of bias and variance. Regularization aims to reduce the complexity of the model by penalizing large weights, which can lead to a reduction in the model's bias. However, it can also lead to an increase in the model's variance, as the regularization penalty forces the model to fit the training data less accurately.\n\nIn the case of a linear regression model with $\\ell_2$ regularization, as the regularization coefficient increases, the model's bias will likely increase, as the regularization penalty will push the weights towards zero, which can result in a model that is too simple and cannot accurately capture the underlying patterns in the data. At the same time, the model's variance may also increase, as the regularization penalty may cause the model to fit the training data more accurately, but at the cost of overfitting the data and having high variance.\n\nIn summary, the effect of adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to a linear regression model can be understood through the balance between bias and variance. As the regularization coefficient increases, the model's bias will likely increase, while its variance may also increase. The optimal regularization coefficient will depend on the specific problem and the training data, and it is often necessary to experiment with different values to find the best combination of bias and variance.",
