            "question": "Bariatric surgery is used for obesity treatment but how much is the incidence of type 2 diabetes reduced in obese individuals after surgery?\n\n\n(A) 80-90%\n(B) No reduction in the incidence\n(C) Approximately 50 %\n(D) None of the options given is correct",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **D**.\n\nBariatric surgery is a surgical procedure that aims to reduce the size of the stomach and/or intestine to limit the amount of food that can be consumed. This can lead to significant weight loss and improvement in overall health, including the reduction of type 2 diabetes. However, the exact effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of type 2 diabetes is not well established.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that bariatric surgery can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. For example, a study published in the journal Obesity found that individuals who had undergone bariatric surgery had a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who had not undergone surgery. However, the study was limited by its small sample size and the fact that it was not a randomized controlled trial.\n\nAdditionally, a meta-analysis of studies published between 1990 and 2015 found that bariatric surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to non-operative treatments. However, the authors of the meta-analysis noted that the quality of the studies included in the analysis was generally low, and that the results should be interpreted with caution.\n\nOverall, while there is some evidence to suggest that bariatric surgery can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals, more research is needed to fully understand the effects of this procedure on the incidence of this condition.",

Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement is: **C**. Consumption of soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol.\n\nThis is because soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols are known to reduce the absorption of dietary fat and increase the production of bile acids, which can lead to increased levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Ammonia is the main nitrogenous compound in urine. Ammonia is produced in the liver and is released into the bloodstream as a result of protein breakdown. When the body breaks down protein, it releases nitrogenous waste products, including amino acids and nitrogenous bases such as uric acid and creatine. Urea is a byproduct of protein breakdown and is also a nitrogenous waste product. However, unlike ammonia, which is quickly excreted in the urine, the level of urine urea increases as the body processes more protein. Urea is also produced in the kidney and is used to regulate the amount of water in the body. Creatinine is a final byproduct of muscle metabolism and is also a nitrogenous waste product. However, unlike the other nitrogenous compounds in urine, creatinine is not produced by the body and is instead derived from the breakdown of creatine in the muscles.",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement is:\n\n(C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe amount of oxygen available in the headspace of canned food is kept at a high level so as to limit losses of vitamin C. This is because vitamin C is sensitive to oxygen and can be easily destroyed by exposure to air.\n\nHowever, the amount of oxygen in the headspace of canned vegetables is typically lower than that of canned fruits, so the vitamin C in canned vegetables is more susceptible to loss during storage.\n\nIn addition, some fruits, such as cherries and blueberries, are naturally high in vitamin C and can withstand longer periods of storage without significant loss. On the other hand, many canned vegetables, such as tomatoes and beans, are low in vitamin C and can lose significant amounts of vitamin C during storage.\n\nTherefore, the statement correctly notes that the losses of vitamin C in canned fruits are generally lower than those in canned vegetables.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The primary lipoprotein secreted from the liver that is at least partially composed of dietary derived lipids is likely to be high-density lipoprotein (HDL).\n\nHDL is a complex particle made up of several proteins and lipids. One of the main lipids found in HDL is cholesterol, which is transported to the liver for processing and storage. Dietary lipids are also found in HDL, and these lipids are used by the liver to produce more HDL.\n\nThe main protein found in HDL is apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which helps to stabilize the particle and promote its transport to the liver and other tissues. Other important proteins found in HDL include apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), and lecithin-cholesterol acetyl transferase (LCAT).\n\nOverall, the combination of dietary lipids, proteins, and other substances found in HDL helps to transport excess cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, where it can be used for energy or other purposes. Therefore, it is likely that the primary lipoprotein secreted from the liver that is at least partially composed of dietary derived lipids is HDL.",

Glutamate is a neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in various neurological processes, while the other amino acids are primarily used for protein synthesis. In conditions of metabolic or other stress, the body may require more protein synthesis to support cellular repair and survival, which could require increased production of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. However, the production of other amino acids, such asalanine and glycine, which are also used in protein synthesis, may be able to be maintained or increased to meet the demands of the body. Therefore, in this case, it is likely that the body would require a greater amount of the dispensable amino acid D, which can be produced from the other amino acids in the body.",

            "model_answer": "The most correct statement is:\n\n\"C: Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.\"\n\nThis is because both galactose and fructose are monosaccharides, which are simple sugars that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the small intestine via the brush border membrane. The sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGLT1) is the primary transporter responsible for glucose absorption, and it is known to transport both glucose and fructose. Therefore, it makes sense that the same transporter is responsible for the absorption of both galactose and fructose.",
