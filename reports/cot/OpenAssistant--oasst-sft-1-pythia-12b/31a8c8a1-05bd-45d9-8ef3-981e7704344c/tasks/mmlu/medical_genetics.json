            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C).\n\nThe reason is that the heritability of BMI is approximately 50%, which means that half of the variation in BMI is due to genetic factors. However, the observed heritability from genome-wide association studies is only about 13%, which means that only 13% of the variation in BMI is due to genetic factors. This suggests that the remaining variation is due to other factors, such as environmental factors or the effects of non-genetic factors.\n\nTo estimate the proportion of variation due to genetic factors, we can use the formula for heritability:\n\nh^2 = (Variance among relatives) / (Variance among individuals)\n\nwhere h^2 is the heritability, Variance among relatives is the variance among relatives due to genetic factors, and Variance among individuals is the variance among individuals due to all factors.\n\nIn this case, Variance among relatives is equal to the sum of the squares of the differences between the BMI of each relative and the mean BMI of the relatives, divided by the number of relatives:\n\nVariance among relatives = (Sum of squared differences between BMI of each relative and mean BMI of relatives) / (Number of relatives)\n\n= ( BMI of each relative - mean BMI of relatives )^2 / (Number of relatives)\n\n= ( BMI - mean BMI )^2 / (Number of relatives)\n\n= ( BMI^2 - (mean BMI)^2 ) / (Number of relatives)\n\n= ( BMI^2 - (1/2) * BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives)\n\n= ( BMI^2 - 0.5 * BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives)\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.5 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.5 * (1/2) * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.5 * 0.25 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.25 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.25 * 0.5 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.25 * 0.25 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.5 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * BMI^2\n\n= ( BMI^2 ) / (Number of relatives) - 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.25 * 0.5 * BMI^2\n\n= 0.0625 * BMI^2\n\nTherefore, the proportion of variation due to genetic factors is approximately 0.0625 * BMI^2, or 6.25% of the variation in BMI.",

            "model_answer": "The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is:\n\n(A) 1%\n\nThe risk of phenylketonuria (PKU) is 1 in 10,000 to 15,000 newborns. If a mother has PKU, her child has a 1% chance of inheriting the condition.\n\nHowever, if a mother with PKU does not receive treatment, her child has a 25% chance of inheriting the condition. This is because PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that a child must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition. If a mother with PKU does not receive treatment, her child will inherit one copy of the mutated gene from her and one copy from her father, who does not have PKU.\n\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is 1% (1 in 10,000 to 15,000 newborns).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **D**.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). These mutations result in reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor, leading to increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the blood.\n\nHigh density lipoprotein (HDL) is a protein that plays a role in removing excess cholesterol from the blood. However, in familial hypercholesterolaemia, mutations in the gene that encodes the HDL receptor (HDLR) result in reduced binding of HDL particles to the receptor, leading to decreased clearance of cholesterol from the blood.\n\nHMG-CoA reductase is a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. However, mutations in the gene that encodes HMG-CoA reductase can also lead to familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major form of cholesterol in the blood, and its levels are closely linked to the risk of heart disease. In familial hypercholesterolaemia, mutations in the gene that encodes the LDL receptor result in reduced binding of LDL particles to the receptor, leading to increased levels of LDL in the blood.\n\nOverall, the mutations in the genes that encode the LDLR, HDLR, and HMG-CoA reductase are responsible for the development of familial hypercholesterolaemia, which is a risk factor for heart disease.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross\n\nQTL analysis is a statistical method used to identify genetic regions that are associated with a complex trait. In a genetic cross, individuals are randomly mated to produce offspring that inherit different combinations of genetic factors. By analyzing the segregation of the trait in the offspring, researchers can identify regions of the genome that are likely to contain genes that are involved in the trait.\n\nQTL analysis can be used to identify regions that are associated with a variety of traits, including height, weight, disease risk, and response to drugs. For example, researchers can use this method to identify regions of the genome that are associated with height, which is a complex trait that is influenced by multiple genetic factors.\n\n(B) Determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage\n\nQTL analysis can also be used to determine which genes are expressed at a particular developmental stage. For example, researchers can use this method to determine which genes are expressed during the development of a plant, and whether these genes are associated with the trait of interest.\n\nThis information can be used to identify genes that are important for the development of the trait, and to identify potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve the trait.\n\n(C) Map genes in bacterial viruses\n\nQTL analysis can also be used to map genes in bacterial viruses. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and they often contain genes that are similar to those found in bacteria. By analyzing the segregation of genes in a viral population, researchers can map the location of these genes on the viral genome, and potentially identify genes that are important for the survival and replication of the virus.\n\n(D) Identify RNA polymerase binding sites\n\nQTL analysis can also be used to identify RNA polymerase binding sites. RNA polymerases are enzymes that are responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA, and they bind to specific sequences of DNA known as transcription factor binding sites. By analyzing the segregation of transcription factor binding sites in a genetic cross, researchers can identify regions of the genome that are likely to contain genes that are involved in the regulation of transcription.\n\nThese are some of the ways that QTL analysis can be used to identify genetic regions that are associated with complex traits, determine which genes are expressed at a particular developmental stage, and map genes in bacterial viruses and RNA polymerases.",

The DNA sequence is inserted into the vector and then transformed into a host cell where it is amplified. The amplified DNA is then used to make many copies of the DNA sequence for study or use.\n\n(B) A bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted\n\nA bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted means that a gene from a human has been inserted into the bacterial DNA. This can be done by using a vector to insert the gene into the bacterial DNA, and then transforming the bacteria with the modified DNA. The modified bacteria are then grown in a culture medium to allow the gene to be expressed, and the resulting protein is studied or used.\n\n(C) A bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted\n\nThe F factor is a type of transposon that can move from one location in a bacterial DNA to another location. In the case of E.coli, the F factor has been inserted into the bacterial DNA, allowing it to move around and insert itself into other locations in the DNA. The presence of the F factor in the bacterial DNA does not necessarily mean that a human gene has been inserted, as the F factor can move around and insert itself into other locations in the DNA.\n\n(D) A human chromosome with a transposable element inserted\n\nA transposon is a type of genetic element that can move from one location in a DNA sequence to another location. In the case of E.coli, a transposon called a mariner element has been inserted into the human DNA, allowing it to move around and insert itself into other locations in the DNA. The presence of the mariner element in the human DNA does not necessarily mean that a human gene has been inserted, as the mariner element can move around and insert itself into other locations in the DNA.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population\n\nInbreeding can lead to the loss of genetic diversity within a population, as the probability of having two copies of a gene that is not in Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium (HWE) increases. This can result in reduced ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.\n\n(B) Higher proportion of genes that show Linkage\n\nLinkage refers to the tendency for genes to be inherited together in close proximity. Inbreeding can lead to the formation of linked genes, which can increase the likelihood of the expression of these genes being affected by a mutation or other genetic variation.\n\n(C) Higher proportion of genes with introns\n\nIntronless genes are genes that do not have introns, which are sections of DNA that are removed during the process of translation. Inbreeding can lead to the retention of introns in genes, which can increase the complexity of the gene and make it more difficult to understand its function.\n\n(D) Higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells\n\nInbreeding can lead to the formation of gametes that are more similar to each other than would be expected under random mating, which can result in increased levels of genetic variation within a population.
