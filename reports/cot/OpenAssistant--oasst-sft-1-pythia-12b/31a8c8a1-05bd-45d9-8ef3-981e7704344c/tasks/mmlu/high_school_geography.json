            "model_answer": "The least self-sufficient natural resource in the modern industry is likely to be energy. While all of the countries listed above are major oil producers, only the United States and Japan are major natural gas producers. France, the United Kingdom, and Japan also have significant coal resources, while the United States and Japan have significant nuclear capacity.\n\nIn terms of other natural resources, all of the countries listed above are major producers of forests and agricultural products, but the United States and Japan are also major exporters of these resources. In terms of mineral resources, Japan is the only country listed that is a major producer of iron and steel, while the United States, France, and the United Kingdom are major producers of other minerals such as copper, zinc, and aluminum.\n\nIn conclusion, while all of the countries listed are major producers of natural resources, the least self-sufficient natural resource in the modern industry is likely to be energy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **C**.\n\nInnovative diffusion refers to the process by which new ideas, products, and services are introduced and adopted by individuals and organizations. This process involves a series of steps, including:\n\n1.  Identification of a new idea or product that has potential to be successful.\n2.  Development of a marketing and sales strategy to introduce the idea or product to the target audience.\n3.  Building brand awareness and establishing a reputation for the new idea or product.\n4.  Establishing distribution channels and partnerships with key players in the market.\n5.  Continuously improving and updating the product or idea over time to meet changing customer needs and expectations.\n\nInnovative diffusion is different from other diffusion processes, such as contagious diffusion and relocation diffusion, in that it involves a deliberate and planned effort to introduce and promote a new idea or product. This approach can help organizations to differentiate themselves from competitors and capture a larger share of the market, leading to long-term success.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **D**.\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is a theory that argues that economic, social, and political developments in a given society are the result of a series of cumulative causes, rather than a single cause. The theory holds that the development of a society is influenced by a combination of factors, including the distribution of resources, the level of education and technology, the distribution of power and wealth, and the nature of the political and economic institutions.\n\nWhile statements (A), (B), and (C) are all part of Myrdal's theory, statement (D) is not. This is because statement (D) suggests that the initial advantage of a region will be maintained and expanded, which is not consistent with the theory of cumulative causation, which holds that the development of a society is influenced by a combination of factors and that initial advantages can be lost or overcome through further economic and social development.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is D. World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres. The reason is that the Earth is an oblate spheroid shape, meaning it is roughly spherical in shape but slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This shape makes it difficult for world cities to exist in the southern hemisphere, as they would not be able to reach the equator without traveling through countries that are significantly larger in area than they are in height. Additionally, the climate in the southern hemisphere is much different from that in the northern and western hemispheres, making it difficult for people to live and work in these regions.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **D**.\n\nThe substitution principle states that if a good or service is produced by a process that requires a certain input, then the same input can be used to produce a substitute good or service that provides the same level of utility. In the case of production activities and people, the input would be space and resources, and the substitute good or service would be the concentration of production activities and people in a specific location to benefit everyone.\n\nHowever, the deglomeration principle states that the concentration of production activities and people should be decentralized to reduce the costs of transportation, communication, and other factors that can limit the efficiency of production. This would result in a more decentralized and less centralized production system, which would not necessarily benefit everyone equally.\n\nThe agglomeration principle states that the concentration of production activities and people should be increased to benefit from economies of scale and to reduce the costs of production. This would result in a more centralized and highly specialized production system, which would benefit those in the production chain who have access to the specialized resources and knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, the concentration of production activities and people spatial to benefit everyone is called **D** because it follows the substitution principle, which states that the same input can be used to produce a substitute good or service, but it does not necessarily follow the deglomeration principle, which states that the concentration of production activities and people should be decentralized to reduce costs, and it does not follow the agglomeration principle, which states that the concentration of production activities and people should be increased to benefit from economies of scale and to reduce the costs of production.",

This is because peripheral countries often have limited resources and infrastructure, which makes it difficult to support a diverse range of economic activities.
