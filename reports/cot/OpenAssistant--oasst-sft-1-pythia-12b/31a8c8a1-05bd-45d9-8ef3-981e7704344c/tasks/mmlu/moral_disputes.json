            "question": " What two problems does individualism lead us into, according to Hourdequin?\n\n(A) It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n(B) They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.\n(C) It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods.\n(D) We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in \"tragedy of the commons\" situations.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n\nHourdequin argues that individualism leads to a breakdown of social cohesion and integration, as individuals prioritize their own interests and values over the interests and values of the group. This can result in a lack of cooperation and collaboration, as individuals act in their own self-interest and prioritize their own needs over the needs of the group.\n\nFor example, in a tragedy of the commons situation, an individual may choose to use a resource that is shared by the group, even if it means that the resource is used less effectively or that the group as a whole is worse off. This can lead to a breakdown of social cohesion and integration, as the individual prioritizes his own interests over the interests of the group.\n\nIn conclusion, individualism leads to failures of developing integration and integrality, as individuals prioritize their own interests over the interests of the group, which can result in a breakdown of social cohesion and integration.",

In the case of the killing/letting die distinction, Foot argues that the decision to kill or let die should be left to the individual, as it is a personal and moral choice that only the individual can make.\n\n(B) Rights to goods and services.\n\nThis principle states that individuals should be provided with the goods and services that they need to lead fulfilling lives. In the case of the killing/letting die distinction, Foot argues that individuals have a right to life, and that the decision to kill or let die should be made in a way that takes this right into account.\n\n(C) Both A and B\n\nThis principle states that individuals should be provided with both the goods and services that they need to lead fulfilling lives, and that their rights should be protected. In the case of the killing/letting die distinction, Foot argues that both the right to life and the right to make personal decisions should be protected.\n\n(D) Neither A nor B\n\nThis principle states that individuals should not be interfered with, and that their rights should be protected.

He argues that attempts to engineer moral behavior through social policies or individual behaviors can lead to a loss of individual freedom and autonomy.\n\n(B) Ethics of prima facie duty: This approach to ethics is based on the idea that individuals have a moral duty to act in ways that are consistent with their own moral character. Sandel applies this approach to the question of moral engineering, arguing that individuals have a moral duty to act in ways that are consistent with their own values and beliefs.\n\n(C) Virtue ethics approach: Sandel also applies a virtue ethics approach to the question of moral engineering. He argues that virtuous individuals are naturally motivated to act in ways that are morally right, and that attempts to engineer moral behavior through social policies or individual behaviors can actually harm moral character.\n\n(D) Natural law theory approach: Finally, Sandel also applies a natural law theory approach to the question of moral engineering. He argues that natural law provides a framework for understanding the moral principles that govern human behavior, and that attempts to engineer moral behavior through social policies or individual behaviors can actually violate natural law.\n\nIn conclusion, Sandel's case against moral engineering can best be considered a Kantian approach, where he argues that moral values and duties are inherent to human nature and cannot be imposed from without.
