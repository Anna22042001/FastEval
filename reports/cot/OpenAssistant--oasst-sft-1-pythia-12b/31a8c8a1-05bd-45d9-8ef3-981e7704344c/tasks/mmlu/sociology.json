            "model_answer": "(A) women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support\n\nBrown & Harris (1978) found that women who had higher levels of social support were less likely to develop depression after experiencing a stressful event. This suggests that social support is a protective factor against depression.\n\n(B) self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent\n\nBrown & Harris (1978) found that self-reported depression was highest among men and the relatively affluent. This suggests that there may be a relationship between income and depression.\n\n(C) men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression\n\nBrown & Harris (1978) found that the levels of diagnosed depression were similar between men and women. This suggests that the gender gap in depression is not due to differences in diagnosis.\n\n(D) men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles\n\nBrown & Harris (1978) found that men were more vulnerable to depression than women. This may be because of traditional gender roles that place men in a more stressful and demanding role.\n\nOverall, the study by Brown & Harris (1978) suggests that social support, income, and conventional gender roles may be important factors in the development of depression.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucracy authority\n\nCapitalists are typically individuals or small businesses who own capital, such as money, equipment, or land, and use it to generate income or to invest in new projects. Salaried managers, on the other hand, are individuals who are employed by organizations to manage and direct the operations of the organization. They typically have more specialized training and experience than traditional managers, and often have more authority and responsibility than their counterparts in the traditional workforce.\n\nIn the context of the embourgeoisement thesis, the replacement of capitalists by salaried managers with bureaucracy authority could be seen as a sign of the increasing economic and political power of the middle class. This could occur because salaried managers are more likely to be drawn from the affluent working class, which has been experiencing economic growth and social advancement in recent decades. As a result, salaried managers are able to exert greater control over the operations of the organization and to influence the policies and practices of the organization.\n\n(B) the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life\n\nThe affluent working class is a group of individuals who have a high level of income and wealth relative to the rest of the population. They are often characterized by a focus on material comfort, consumption, and status-seeking. In the context of the embourgeoisement thesis, the adoption of middle class values and ways of life by the affluent working class could be seen as a sign of their increasing economic and political power. This could occur because the middle class values such as material comfort, consumption, and status-seeking are associated with greater social and economic stability and security, and are often associated with a sense of stability and security in the face of economic uncertainty.\n\n(C) white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace\n\nWhite collar occupations are those that require a high level of education and technical expertise, such as lawyers, doctors, and engineers. In recent years, there has been a growing concern that the increasing use of new technologies in the workplace is leading to the deskilling of white collar occupations and the loss of job opportunities for workers in these fields. In the context of the embourgeoisement thesis, the deskilling of white collar occupations could be seen as a sign of the increasing economic and political power of the middle class. This could occur because the middle class values such as technical expertise and education are associated with greater economic and political power, and are often associated with a sense of stability and security in the face of economic uncertainty.\n\n(D) the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes\n\nThe class structure is a system of social inequality in which different groups of people are ranked according to their economic and political power. In the context of the embourgeoisement thesis, the breakdown of the class structure and the loss of distinct social classes could be seen as a sign of the increasing economic and political power of the middle class. This could occur because the middle class values such as stability and security are associated with a sense of social cohesion and the maintenance of social order, and are often associated with a sense of stability and security in the face of economic uncertainty.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) It has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture\n\nThe data suggests that the use of illegal drugs has increased in recent years. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including the growing popularity of drugs such as ecstasy and methamphetamine. The use of these drugs is often associated with a hedonistic lifestyle and a desire for social connection, which has led to their widespread adoption by young people.\n\nAdditionally, the legalization of some drugs such as cannabis has also contributed to the increase in use. This has led to a more relaxed approach to drug use, which has made it easier for people to experiment with new substances.\n\n(B) The most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy\n\nThe data suggests that ecstasy is the most commonly used recreational drug in Britain. This is not surprising, as it is one of the most popular drugs in the world and is widely available.\n\nThe use of ecstasy has increased in recent years, and it is widely believed that this is due to its popularity among young people. The drug is known for its intense feelings of pleasure and energy, and it is often used to enhance social interactions and parties.\n\n(C) Teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys\n\nThe data suggests that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including the fact that hard drugs are often associated with a more illicit and underground lifestyle.\n\nAdditionally, girls may be more susceptible to the effects of drugs due to their hormonal makeup. During puberty, girls experience a significant increase in the levels of hormones such as estrogen and prolactin, which can lead to changes in their brain chemistry and make them more susceptible to the effects of drugs.\n\n(D) Despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare\n\nThe data suggests that despite a series of moral panics surrounding the use of illegal drugs, the use of these substances is very rare. This can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the fact that many people are afraid of the legal consequences of using drugs and the fact that many people are simply not interested in experimenting with illegal substances.\n\nIn summary, the data suggests that the use of illegal drugs has increased in recent years, and that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with these substances than teenage boys. Despite a series of moral panics surrounding the use of these substances, the use of these substances is very rare.",

            "question": "Weber defined a 'class situation' as:\n\n(A) the exploitation of the working class by their capitalist employers\n(B) a social group's consciousness of their status and life chances\n(C) a person's position in the capital, product and labour markets, based on their economic resources\n(D) the lifestyle of a social class, as defined by patterns of consumption",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) Exploitation of the working class by their capitalist employers:\n\nCapitalism is a system of economic organization in which ownership of the means of production is concentrated in the hands of a minority capitalist class that exists through the exploitation of a working class majority. The working class is made up of individuals who sell their labor for a living, and are subject to economic and social inequality.\n\nThe capitalist employers use their control over the means of production to maximize their profits, which are often obtained through the exploitation of workers. This can occur through a variety of means, including:\n\n1. Wage Slavery: The working class is paid low wages and is forced to work long hours for little or no benefits.\n\n2. Job Security: The capitalist class has a stronghold on the labor market, and can use their control over the means of production to threaten workers with firings or other forms of punishment if they attempt to unionize or protest against their conditions.\n\n3. Exploitation of Labor: The capitalist class uses their control over the means of production to maximize the output of workers, without regard for their well-being or the environment. This can result in dangerous and unhealthy working conditions, as well as environmental degradation.\n\n4. Inequity in the Distribution of Wealth: The capitalist class holds a large amount of wealth and power, while the working class struggles to make ends meet. This inequality is a result of the exploitation of workers by the capitalist class.\n\nOverall, the exploitation of the working class by their capitalist employers is a fundamental aspect of capitalism, and is a key factor in maintaining the economic and social inequality that exists in society.\n\n(B) Social group's consciousness of their status and life chances:\n\nThe concept of social class refers to the different economic and social positions that individuals hold within society. These positions are determined by a combination of factors such as income, wealth, education, and occupation.\n\nSocial classes are often divided into different groups based on these factors, with some groups having more opportunities and resources than others. This can lead to feelings of resentment and inequality among members of different social classes.\n\nFor example, members of the working class may feel that they are being exploited by the capitalist class, while members of the upper class may feel that they are being unfairly rewarded for their hard work.\n\n(C) Person's position in the capital, product and labor markets, based on their economic resources:\n\nThe concept of capital refers to the resources and tools used to produce goods or services. Capital is a crucial factor in determining a person's economic position in society, as it allows individuals to invest in their skills, knowledge, and resources, and to generate income through the sale of their products or services.\n\nIn the capital, product, and labor markets, individuals are often classified based on their economic resources. For example, individuals may be classified as high-, middle-, or low-income earners, depending on their income levels.\n\nThe distribution of economic resources within society can lead to feelings of inequality and resentment, as some individuals may have more resources than others. This can be especially true in the labor market, where individuals may be subject to discrimination based on their economic background.\n\n(D) The lifestyle of a social class, as defined by patterns of consumption:\n\nThe concept of lifestyle refers to the way in which individuals live their daily lives, including their consumption patterns. Lifestyle is a significant factor in determining a person's social class, as it can influence their access to resources and opportunities, and can influence their sense of identity and sense of community.\n\nFor example, members of the working class may have different consumption patterns than members of the upper class, with the working class often preferring to spend their money on basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter, while the upper class may prefer to spend their money on luxury goods and services.\n\nOverall, the concept of social class is complex and multifaceted, and is a key factor in understanding the social and economic inequalities that exist in society. By understanding the ways in which social classes are defined and interact with each other, individuals can work to reduce feelings of resentment and inequality, and to promote a more equitable and just society.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) Not being able to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations is a potential ethical issue with covert participant observation. Covert participant observation is a method of conducting research where the researcher is not openly observed by the participants, but rather covertly observes them through a hidden camera or other means. This can make it difficult for the researcher to gather detailed information about the participants' experiences and perspectives.\n\nIn order to mitigate this issue, it is important for the researcher to take detailed notes during the observation and to record any conversations that occur. This can help to provide a comprehensive record of the research process and ensure that the information collected is accurate and unbiased.\n\nAdditionally, it is important for the researcher to be honest and transparent about their presence and the reason for their observations. This can help to build trust and ensure that the participants are comfortable with being observed.\n\n(B) Deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence is also a potential ethical issue with covert participant observation. Covert participant observation is often used in sensitive or sensitive research contexts, such as social science or psychology research. In these cases, it is important for the researcher to be honest and transparent about their purpose for being there, and to ensure that the participants are aware of the nature of the research.\n\nHowever, it is also possible for the researcher to deceive the participants as to the true nature of the research. For example, the researcher could present themselves as a fellow participant or a member of the research team, and then secretly gather information or make recordings without the participants' knowledge.\n\nIn order to mitigate this issue, it is important for the researcher to be transparent about their true intentions and to ensure that the participants are aware of any deception that may occur. This can help to ensure that the participants are not misled or deceived, and that the research is conducted in a ethical and responsible manner.\n\n(C) Observing people outside of their natural setting is also a potential ethical issue with covert participant observation. Covert participant observation is often used in sensitive or sensitive research contexts, such as social science or psychology research. In these cases, it is important for the researcher to be aware of the potential for harm or discomfort that may be caused by their presence.\n\nHowever, it is also possible for the researcher to observe people in their natural setting, without their knowledge or consent. For example, the researcher could secretly film people in a public space or at a private event, without their consent.\n\nIn order to mitigate this issue, it is important for the researcher to be aware of the potential for harm or discomfort that may be caused by their presence, and to take steps to minimize any potential harm or discomfort. This may include seeking permission from the people being observed or using appropriate ethical research practices, such as informed consent or privacy protection.\n\n(D) Subjecting the participants to physical harm is a serious ethical issue with covert participant observation. Covert participant observation is often used in sensitive or sensitive research contexts, such as social science or psychology research. In these cases, it is important for the researcher to be aware of the potential for harm or discomfort that may be caused by their presence.\n\nHowever, it is also possible for the researcher to cause physical harm to the participants. For example, the researcher could physically assault or threaten the participants, or engage in other forms of physical or emotional abuse.\n\nIn order to mitigate this issue, it is important for the researcher to be aware of the potential for harm or discomfort that may be caused by their presence, and to take steps to minimize any potential harm or discomfort. This may include seeking permission from the people being observed or using appropriate ethical research practices, such as informed consent or privacy protection.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible for the researcher to mitigate some of the ethical issues with covert participant observation by being transparent and taking steps to minimize harm or discomfort, it is important to be aware of all potential ethical issues and to take appropriate steps to ensure that the research is conducted in a ethical and responsible manner.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with that. Here's how you can answer the question step-by-step:\n\nExplain your reasoning:\n\nA survey should avoid asking fixed-choice questions because they are not useful for measuring attitudes or preferences. A fixed-choice question only allows for one answer, which may not accurately reflect the true opinion of the participant.\n\nA survey should avoid asking short questions because they are not comprehensive enough to capture the full range of opinions or attitudes. Short questions may not provide enough information for the participant to provide a well-informed answer.\n\nA survey should avoid asking leading questions because they can bias the responses. Leading questions suggest a certain answer, which may not be true.\n\nA survey should avoid asking funnelled questions because they are not easy to answer. Funnelled questions may lead the participant to give an answer that they think is correct, but it may not be the truth.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\nA survey should avoid asking questions that ask for a single answer. Instead, it should ask multiple questions that allow the participant to provide a more comprehensive response.\n\nFor example, a survey could ask the participant to rate their agreement with a statement on a scale of 1 to 5, or to provide written comments. This type of question allows the participant to provide a more nuanced response that takes into account their individual perspectives and experiences.\n\nAnswer the question with a single letter:\n\nTo answer the question, you would need to look at the different types of questions that were asked and determine which type of question best fits the survey's objectives.\n\nFor this question, I believe that the best type of question to ask is a multiple-choice question. A multiple-choice question allows the participant to select the best answer from a list of options, which provides a more accurate representation of their opinion.\n\nHere's an example of a multiple-choice question that would fit the criteria:\n\n\"Do you think that a survey should avoid asking questions that ask for a single answer?\"\n\nAnswer: A\n\nNote: This is just one example of a multiple-choice question that could be used in a survey. It's important to consider the objectives of the survey and choose the type of question that will provide the most accurate and useful information.",
