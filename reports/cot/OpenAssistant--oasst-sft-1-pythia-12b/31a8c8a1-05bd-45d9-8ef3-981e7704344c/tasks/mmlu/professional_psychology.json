            "model_answer": "The Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's (1993) Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model suggests that people in the \"integrative awareness\" stage begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture. This stage involves a gradual process of integration and recognition of one's own cultural identity, as well as a willingness to engage with and learn from the dominant culture.\n\nIn this stage, individuals may begin to question their beliefs and values about race and ethnicity, and may begin to recognize the ways in which their own cultural background has influenced their experiences and perspectives. They may also begin to explore their own cultural identity and to seek out opportunities to engage with the dominant culture in a positive and meaningful way.\n\nIn contrast, individuals in the \"dissonance\" stage may continue to reject all aspects of the dominant culture, but may also experience a sense of tension and conflict between their own cultural identity and the expectations of the dominant culture. They may feel torn between their loyalty to their own culture and their desire to fit in and be accepted by the dominant culture.\n\nIn the \"introspection\" stage, individuals may further explore their own cultural identity and may begin to develop a deeper understanding of the ways in which their own cultural background has influenced their experiences and perspectives. They may also become more comfortable with their own cultural identity and may begin to integrate it more fully into their daily lives.\n\nOverall, the Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's (1993) Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model suggests that individuals in the \"integrative awareness\" stage are more likely to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and to seek out opportunities to engage with and learn from the dominant culture in a positive and meaningful way.",

The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test that does not assume that the data follow a particular distribution.\n\n(B) Form of the distribution of scores in the investigated population is not known\n\nIn this case, it is not known what distribution the scores follow.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **C**.\n\nThe explanation is as follows:\n\n    Electrical stimulation of the brain for the treatment of chronic pain can produce its effects by promoting the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. This mechanism is thought to involve the activation of specific neurons in the brain, which in turn leads to the release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.\n\n    Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of pain and stress responses. It is known to play a role in the transmission of pain signals from the nociceptive neurons to the brain, and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and headaches.\n\n    Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that electrical stimulation of the brain for the treatment of chronic pain may promote the release of norepinephrine, which in turn may lead to the reduction of pain and stress symptoms.\n\n    However, it is important to note that the use of electrical stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain is still considered experimental and has not been widely accepted by the medical community. Additionally, there are potential risks and side effects associated with the use of electrical stimulation, such as seizures and brain damage. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of electrical stimulation before pursuing this treatment option.",

The test is based on the chi-square distribution, which is a special distribution that is used to test whether two or more populations have the same or different proportions.\n\nThe CHI-SQUARE test is used when the data is categorical, meaning that the categories are not measured on a continuous scale. For example, in a study on the effectiveness of a new medication, the data could be recorded as \"success\" or \"failure\" for each patient.\n\nThe CHI-SQUARE test is not used when research involves rank-ordered data, meaning that the data is ordered from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. For example, in a study on the effectiveness of a new medication, the data could be recorded as \"success\" or \"failure\" for each patient, but the order of the patients would not be important.\n\nThe CHI-SQUARE test is not used when two correlated groups are being compared using rank-ordered data. This means that the data from both groups is ordered from lowest to highest or highest to lowest, and the groups are correlated, meaning that the data from one group is dependent on the data from the other group.\n\nThe CHI-SQUARE test is used when an analysis of variance for rank-ordered data is being performed.

It is a way to measure the uncertainty of a score. When reporting test results, it is important to focus on the confidence interval rather than the obtained score itself. This helps to communicate the uncertainty of the score to readers.\n\nFor example, if a test has a 95% confidence interval of [2, 4], this means that there is a 95% chance that the true score of the test lies within the range of [2, 4].

Declarative memory is the type of memory that is used for storing facts, procedures, and concepts. It is also known as explicit memory. This type of memory is not based on the current context, but rather on the knowledge and experiences that the individual has already acquired.\n\nThe reason why declarative memory is considered to be more automatic than the other types of memory is that it requires more effort to retrieve information from memory. This is because declarative memory is based on the individual's knowledge and experiences, which can be stored in a specific way and can be retrieved with effort.\n\nFor example, if you want to remember the capital of a state, you need to recall the name of the state and its capital city. This type of information is stored in declarative memory, and it requires effort to retrieve it. In contrast, if you want to remember the lyrics of a song, you do not need to recall the entire song. This information is stored in semantic memory, which is more automatic and can be retrieved with less effort.\n\nIn conclusion, declarative memory is considered to be the most automatic of the proposed memory systems because it requires more effort to retrieve information than the other types of memory, and it is based on the individual's knowledge and experiences.",
