            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"C\".\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by breaking down the number into its individual digits. The MSD is the sum of the squares of the individual digits.\n\nThe first digit from left to right is \"1\". Squaring it gives us \"1 squared = 1\".\nThe first digit from right to left is \"9\". Squaring it gives us \"9 squared = 81\".\nThe middle digit is \"7\". Squaring it gives us \"7 squared = 49\".\nThe mean of all digits is the average of the squares of the individual digits. In this case, the mean is (1 + 9 + 7) / 3 = 4.5.\n\nSo, the MSD is \"C\", which is the average of the squares of the individual digits.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **D**.\n\nTo answer this question step-by-step, we need to understand the basic principles of induction heating. In an induction heating system, a current is passed through a coil of wire, which generates a magnetic field. When the magnetic field interacts with the metal being heated, it generates heat and causes the metal to melt.\n\nIn a direct core type induction heating system, the primary coil is wound around the core of the heating coil. This creates a strong magnetic field that is focused on the core, where it heats the metal. The secondary coil is wound around the outside of the heating coil, and it provides a return path for the heat generated by the primary coil.\n\nIn order to prevent the stirring action caused by the electromagnetic forces, a low frequency supply is used. This low frequency supply generates a magnetic field with a frequency that is lower than the frequency of the current in the primary coil. This magnetic field interacts with the metal in a way that minimizes stirring, and it allows the metal to be heated more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, to ensure that the magnetic field is properly coupled between the primary and secondary circuits, a magnetic material is used to fill the gap between the primary and secondary coil. This material helps to ensure that the magnetic field is strong and consistent, and it helps to ensure that the heat is transferred efficiently from the primary coil to the metal being heated.\n\nFinally, to ensure that the molten metal does not become contaminated, a protective barrier is used to cover the heating coil. This barrier prevents the metal from coming in contact with the air, and it helps to ensure that the metal is heated in a clean and safe manner.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The lowest critical frequency (fc) of an electrical network is the frequency at which the network becomes unstable and begins to exhibit oscillations. This frequency is determined by the network's topology, including the number and location of nodes and branches.\n\nIn an electrical network, the critical frequency is typically determined by the number and location of poles and zeros in the network's transfer function. A pole is a point in the frequency domain where the network's gain (the ratio of output to input) is infinite, and a zero is a point where the network's gain is zero.\n\nThe type of network can be determined by analyzing the network's transfer function and identifying the presence of poles and zeros. If the network has a single pole or zero at the origin, it is an RL network. If the network has two poles or zeros at the origin, it is an RLC network. If the network has three poles or zeros at the origin, it is an RLC network with a low-pass filter. If the network has more than three poles or zeros at the origin, it is an RLC network with a high-pass filter.\n\nIn conclusion, the lowest critical frequency of an electrical network is due to a pole at the origin or near the origin, and the type of network is determined by the presence of poles and zeros in the transfer function.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) 40\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nThe total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is the sum of the electric displacement due to the surface charge and the electric displacement due to the induced charge. The surface charge density is 20 coulombs/m2, which gives a surface charge of 20 coulombs.\n\nThe induced charge is equal to the product of the surface charge density and the surface area of the cube. The surface area of the cube is 10 m * 10 m = 100 m2, so the induced charge is 100 coulombs/m2 * 100 m2 = 10,000 coulombs.\n\nThe total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is 40 + 10,000 = 50,000 coulombs.\n\nTherefore, answer (A) is correct.",
