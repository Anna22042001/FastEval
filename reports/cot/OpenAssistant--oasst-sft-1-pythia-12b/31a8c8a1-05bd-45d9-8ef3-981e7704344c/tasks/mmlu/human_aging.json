            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **C**.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Older workers are more likely to have experience in the workforce, which could make them more knowledgeable and comfortable with their jobs.\n2. Older workers may also have more seniority and greater access to resources and training, which could make them more valuable to their employers and increase their chances of being retained.\n3. Older workers may also have more life experience and perspectives, which could make them more open to new ideas and approaches and help them adapt to changes in the workplace.\n4. On the other hand, older workers may also have more health problems, which could make them more susceptible to job loss or other economic challenges.\n\nOverall, the more experience an older worker has in the workforce, the more likely it is that they will be satisfied with their jobs and remain in the workforce, rather than retiring or seeking employment in another field.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is \"C\".\n\nThe reason is that a casket is a container that is used to protect the body during funeral services, and a naturalistic cemetery is designed to allow the body to decompose naturally without the use of a casket. A green cemetery, on the other hand, uses natural materials to bury the bodies, and rapid decay is a term used to describe the process of decomposition where the body quickly breaks down into smaller pieces. Sunshine, on the other hand, is not a factor in the decomposition of a body.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The reason for the increase in the number of older adults is complex and multifaceted, and the reasons can vary depending on the context and the specific population being considered. Here are some of the major reasons for the increase in the number of older adults:\n\n1. The Baby Boom generation: The Baby Boom generation, which was born between 1946 and 1964, has led to a significant increase in the number of older adults. This generation was born during a time of rapid economic growth, technological advancements, and social change, and they have had a significant impact on society and the economy.\n\n2. The steadily increasing birth rate: Over the past several decades, the birth rate in many countries has increased, which has led to a larger population of young people and a smaller population of older adults. This has contributed to the overall increase in the number of older adults.\n\n3. Increases in life expectancy at birth: Life expectancy at birth has increased over the past several decades, due to advances in medical technology and public health efforts. This has led to a larger population of older adults who have lived longer than previous generations.\n\n4. Increases in life expectancy at a specified age: In some countries, life expectancy at a specified age has increased significantly, which has led to a larger population of older adults who have lived longer than previous generations. For example, in the United States, life expectancy at age 65 has increased from about 7 years in the 1960s to about 20 years today.\n\nOverall, the increase in the number of older adults is a result of a combination of factors, including the Baby Boom generation, the steadily increasing birth rate, increases in life expectancy at birth, and increases in life expectancy at a specified age.",
