            "model_answer": "The DNA strand with the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 would be complementary to the sequence (A).\n\nThe DNA strand is made up of four nucleobases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 consists of three nucleobases: C, G, and T. The nucleobases C and T are complementary to each other, meaning that they pair up to form a base pair (C-T). Similarly, the nucleobases G and A also form a base pair (G-A).\n\nTherefore, the DNA strand with the sequence 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 would be complementary to the sequence (A), because the sequence (A) consists of three nucleobases: A, U, and G, which are also complementary to each other.",

            "model_answer": "(A) They protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with plants, where the fungi live in the soil and provide nutrients to the plant through their roots. In extremely dry habitats, such as deserts or high elevations, the fungi can help protect the plant's roots from dehydration by providing a humid environment around the roots. This can help the plant survive in these harsh conditions.\n\n(B) They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.\n\nNitrogen is an essential element for plant growth, and it is often limited in nutrient-deprived soil. Mycorrhizal fungi can help plants obtain nitrogen by fixing it from the atmosphere through a process called nitrogen fixing. This means that the fungi convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by plants, such as nitrates or amino acids.\n\n(C) They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n\nPhosphorus is an essential element for plant growth, and it is often limited in nutrient-deprived soil. Mycorrhizal fungi can help plants obtain phosphorus by providing it to the plant through their roots. This can help the plant survive in these harsh conditions.\n\n(D) They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi can help plants obtain carbon by providing it to the plant through their roots. This can help the plant survive in these harsh conditions. In exchange for this carbon, the fungi obtain fixed nitrogen from the atmosphere, which can be used by the plant.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement is:\n\n(C) Its composite flattenedcisternae are continuous with one another.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is a complex organelle that plays a key role in the sorting and modification of proteins in the cell. It is composed of a series of flattenedcisternae that are connected by tubules and vesicular structures. The flattenedcisternae are made up of a stack of membrane sheets that are stacked one on top of another, with the outermost sheet being covered in a layer of golgi proteins.\n\nThe continuity of the flattenedcisternae is important because it allows for the transfer of materials between the different parts of the organelle. For example, proteins that have been modified by the addition of sugar molecules are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi where they are further modified and sorted.\n\nIn conclusion, the continuity of the flattenedcisternae is a key feature of the golgi apparatus, and is necessary for the proper function of the organelle.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D): Endosperm.\n\nDouble fertilization occurs in angiosperms, a group of plants that includes many important crops, such as tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. In this process, one sperm from the male flower fertilizes the egg from the female flower, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The second sperm then fertilizes the polar nuclei of the zygote, leading to the development of the endosperm, a specialized storage organ that provides nutrients to the developing embryo.\n\nEndosperm is formed from the fusion of two sperm cells, one from the male flower and one from the female flower. The endosperm then provides nutrients to the developing embryo, including proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. In angiosperms, the endosperm is the largest organ in the plant and is essential for the development of a healthy seedling.",
