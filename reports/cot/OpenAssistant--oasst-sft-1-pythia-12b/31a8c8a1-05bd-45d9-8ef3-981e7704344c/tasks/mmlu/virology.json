            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The most common use of next generation sequencers (NGS) is to identify newly discovered viruses. This is because NGS can quickly and accurately sequence large amounts of DNA or RNA, which is essential for identifying the genetic makeup of a virus. Additionally, NGS can also be used to search for drug resistant mutants, as NGS can detect small changes in DNA that may indicate the presence of a resistant strain. Finally, NGS can also be used to identify quasi species viruses, which are viruses that have evolved to be able to infect different species. However, NGS cannot be used to identify viruses that have already been discovered.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Placebo effect\n\nRandomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for the placebo effect, which is the psychological effect of receiving a treatment that is expected to have no effect. Placebo effects can occur for any treatment, including medications and lifestyle changes. Randomization helps to ensure that all study subjects receive the same treatment, reducing the likelihood that the treatment effect is due to the patient's expectations rather than the actual treatment.\n\n(B) Recall bias\n\nRecall bias is the tendency to remember or report past events more positively than current events. In a clinical trial, recall bias can occur if study subjects are asked to recall their experiences during the study period, and these memories are influenced by their expectations or beliefs about the treatment. Randomization can help to reduce recall bias by ensuring that all study subjects receive the same treatment, reducing the likelihood that their memories are influenced by their expectations.\n\n(C) Non-compliance\n\nNon-compliance is the failure to take the medication or follow the lifestyle recommendations as prescribed by the study protocol. In a clinical trial, non-compliance can occur if study subjects are unable or unwilling to follow the study protocol, which can result in differences in the treatment effect between study subjects. Randomization can help to reduce non-compliance by ensuring that all study subjects receive the same treatment, reducing the likelihood that their treatment effect is due to differences in compliance.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction)\n\nEffect modification (interaction) is the phenomenon in which the effect of a treatment on an outcome is different for different groups of study subjects. In a clinical trial, effect modification can occur if the treatment has different effects on different groups of study subjects. Randomization can help to identify and account for effect modification by ensuring that all study subjects receive the same treatment, reducing the likelihood that the treatment effect is due to differences in other factors.",

The data is then analyzed to see if there are any patterns or changes in the participants' health that may be related to the exposure to the toxin.\n\nIn this study, the participants would be followed over time to see if they develop any symptoms or health problems related to the exposure to the toxin. The data collected would be used to determine the potential effects of the toxin and to identify any patterns or changes in the participants' health.\n\nThis type of study design is important because it allows researchers to gather a large amount of data over a long period of time, which can help them better understand the relationship between the exposure to the toxin and the participants' health.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is **C**.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections, including the common cold and more severe diseases such as SARS and MERS. While SARS and MERS were both severe global health emergencies, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses were not considered to be \"emergent\" viruses, as they had been known to cause similar symptoms for many years.\n\nHowever, in late 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to many countries around the world, causing a global pandemic. While the exact number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 is still being calculated, it is estimated that the virus has caused thousands of deaths around the world, including in countries such as China, Italy, and the United States.\n\nTherefore, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be an \"emergent\" virus, as it has caused a significant and sudden increase in the number of deaths and cases of COVID-19 around the world.",

This integration leads to the activation of cellular genes that promote cell growth and division, which can lead to the development of cancer. The three viral proteins encoded by the papilloma family of viruses, E5, E6, and E7, have been shown to contribute to the development of cancer by disrupting the normal cell cycle and promoting cell growth. Additionally, the viral proteins can act as co-factors for cellular oncogenes, further contributing to the development of cancer. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **C**. The rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo.\n\nThe rabies vaccine is a live virus vaccine that is given in multiple doses over a period of time to provide protection against rabies. The vaccine is made from a strain of the rabies virus that is grown in human diploid cells, which are derived from an aborted embryo. This process allows for the production of a highly effective and safe vaccine.\n\nThe original rabies vaccine was produced from the spinal cord of infected rabbits, which was then dried and stored. However, this vaccine was not very effective and required multiple doses to provide protection. In the late 1800s, L. Pasteur developed a killed rabies vaccine that was more effective and easier to store.\n\nOver the years, the rabies vaccine has been improved and modified to make it more effective and easier to use. The current rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells and is highly effective in providing protection against rabies. The vaccine is given in a single dose and is easy to use, making it a popular choice for preventing rabies in humans and animals.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Adaptive immunity is a type of immune system that is capable of responding quickly and accurately to foreign proteins. This is achieved through the creation of specialized cells called B cells and T cells.\n\nB cells are responsible for producing antibodies, which are proteins that can recognize and bind to foreign substances. When an organism is exposed to a foreign protein, B cells are activated and produce antibodies that can bind to the protein and neutralize it.\n\nT cells, on the other hand, are responsible for cell-mediated immunity. They recognize and attack foreign cells that have invaded the body, such as viruses and bacteria. T cells are also capable of memory, which means that they can remember the presence of a foreign substance and respond more quickly and effectively if it is encountered again.\n\nAdaptive immunity is unique in its ability to distinguish self and non-self proteins. This is because B cells and T cells are specifically designed to recognize and respond to molecules that are unique to the body, such as those found on the surface of cells.\n\nAdaptive immunity is also able to distinguish viruses and bacteria, as B cells and T cells can recognize and respond to different types of viruses and bacteria. This helps to prevent the spread of infections and protect the organism from harm.\n\nIn conclusion, adaptive immunity is a unique and powerful type of immune system that is capable of responding quickly and accurately to foreign proteins, distinguishing self and non-self proteins, and distinguishing viruses and bacteria.",

By inoculating individuals with vaccines, we can reduce the risk of an outbreak and prevent the spread of diseases.\n\nVaccines work by introducing a harmless piece of a virus or a piece of a protein from a virus to the body's immune system.
