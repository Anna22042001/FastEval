            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: **C**.\n\nTo answer this question step-by-step, we need to understand the different strategies of pricing. Premium pricing is where the price of a product is higher than its competitors, which can attract more customers and increase market share. Price skimming is where the price of a product is lower than its competitors, but the product is still considered to be of high quality and is sold at a high price to maximize profit. Economy pricing is where the price of a product is lower than its competitors, but the product is still of good quality and is sold at a low price to meet market demand. Penetration pricing is where the price of a product is lower than its competitors, but the product is sold in a niche market and has a high profit margin.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can determine that the strategy used by the company is price skimming. The company is setting the price of its product low relative to its competitors to gain market share and attract more customers. However, the product is still considered to be of good quality and is sold at a high price to maximize profit. This strategy is often used by companies that are trying to establish themselves in a new market or to compete against well-established competitors.",
