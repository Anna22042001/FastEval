            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The Egyptian composition \"Ludul Belnemequi\" (\"I will praise the Lord of wisdom\") portrays Marduk in a way that can be best described as \"transcendent and immanent\".\n\nThe first line of the composition, \"Ludul Belnemequi\", is a declaration of praise to the god Marduk. The word \"ludul\" means \"love\" in ancient Egyptian, and the phrase \"belnemequi\" is a combination of the words \"Marduk\" and \"wisdom\". This suggests that the composer is expressing his love and admiration for Marduk, the god of wisdom and power.\n\nThe second line of the composition, \"ki n-nefer\", is a phrase that translates to \"I am the god of wisdom\". This suggests that Marduk is the god of wisdom and that the composer is expressing his belief in his power and authority.\n\nThe third line of the composition, \"s-s-s-s-s\", is a series of sounds that are difficult to translate into English. However, based on the context of the composition, it is likely that the sounds represent the sound of Marduk's thundering voice.\n\nThe fourth line of the composition, \"n-n-n-n-n\", is a phrase that translates to \"I am the judge of the earth\". This suggests that Marduk is the god of justice and that the composer is expressing his belief in his power and authority.\n\nThe fifth line of the composition, \"n-n-n-n-n\", is a phrase that translates to \"I am the god of vengeance\". This suggests that Marduk is the god of vengeance and that the composer is expressing his belief in his power and authority.\n\nThe final line of the composition, \"m-m-m-m-m\", is a phrase that translates to \"I am the god of the universe\". This suggests that Marduk is the god of the universe and that the composer is expressing his belief in his power and authority.\n\nOverall, the Egyptian composition \"Ludul Belnemequi\" (\"I will praise the Lord of wisdom\") portrays Marduk as a god who is both transcendent and immanent, who is loved and feared by his followers, and who exercises his power and authority to bring order and justice to the world.",
