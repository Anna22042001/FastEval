This suggests that the practitioner is the one who is taking action, rather than the patient. Therefore, it is unlikely that the pronoun \"she\" refers to the patient.\n\nThe patient, on the other hand, is the object of the sentence, and the sentence states that the practitioner made a house call for the patient because the patient felt gravely ill. This suggests that the patient is the one who is experiencing illness, and the practitioner is taking action to help the patient. Therefore, it is likely that the pronoun \"she\" refers to the patient.\n\nBased on this analysis, the antecedent of the pronoun \"she\" is the patient.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Ambiguous.\n\nHowever, if we had to choose a single answer, we could choose (B) The patient felt ill, as it is more likely that the pronoun \"she\" refers to the patient rather than the practitioner.\n\nIs there anything else you would like me to clarify?",

Therefore, the antecedent of \"he\" is the patient, and the correct answer is option (B).\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the sentence is not entirely clear, as it could also be interpreted that the practitioner felt ill and made a house call for the patient as a result.
