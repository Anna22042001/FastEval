We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\nHow many penguins are more than 5 years old?\nOptions:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) 3\n(D) 4\n(E) 5",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the penguins who are more than 5 years old. To do this, we need to compare each penguin's age to 5.\n2. Louis is 7 years old, so he is more than 5 years old.\n3. Gwen is 8 years old, so she is also more than 5 years old.\n4. Vincent is 9 years old, so he is also more than 5 years old.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old: Louis, Gwen, and Vincent.\n\nNow, let me output the answer:\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 3.",
