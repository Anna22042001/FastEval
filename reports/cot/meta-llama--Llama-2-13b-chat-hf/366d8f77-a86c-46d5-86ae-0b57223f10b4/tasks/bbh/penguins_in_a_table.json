Next, let's look at the third column, which is the height of each penguin in centimeters. The heights are: 50, 80, 60, and 70.\n4. Now, let's look at the fourth column, which is the weight of each penguin in kilograms. The weights are: 11, 13, 11, and 15.\n5. Now, let's analyze the information we have. We know that the age of each penguin is at least 5, since that's the minimum age listed in the table.\n6.

So, Louis is less than 8 years old.\n\nNext, let's check Vincent, who is 9 years old. Is 9 less than 8? No, it is not.

The next line is Louis, 7, 50, 11. This tells us that Louis is 7 years old, 50 cm tall, and weighs 11 kg.\n\nThe next line is Bernard, 5, 80, 13. This tells us that Bernard is 5 years old, 80 cm tall, and weighs 13 kg. However, we are deleting Bernard from the table, so we will not consider him further.\n\nThe next line is Vincent, 9, 60, 11. This tells us that Vincent is 9 years old, 60 cm tall, and weighs 11 kg.\n\nThe final line is Gwen, 8, 70, 15. This tells us that Gwen is 8 years old, 70 cm tall, and weighs 15 kg.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. We can start by finding out how many penguins are more than 5 years old.\n\nLouis and Vincent are both more than 5 years old, so there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many penguins weigh more than 12 kg. Louis weighs 11 kg, which is less than 12 kg, so he does not count. Vincent weighs 11 kg, which is also less than 12 kg, so he does not count either.\n\nGwen weighs 15 kg, which is more than 12 kg, so she is the only penguin who weighs more than 12 kg. Therefore, the answer to the question \"How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?\" is (C) 1.\n\nHere is the final answer: (C) 1.",
