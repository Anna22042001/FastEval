Today is the 5th visit, so the current month is the month that contains the 5th visit.\n3. The 5th visit occurred one year ago, so we need to find the date one year ago from today.\n4. To find the date one year ago, we need to subtract one year from the current date.\n5. The current date is not given, but we know that the 5th visit occurred on the 16th of the month, so we can assume that today's date is also the 16th of the month.\n6. Therefore, the date one year ago from today would be the 16th of the month one year prior to today.\n\nNow, let's think about the months and dates involved:\n\n* Today's date is the 16th of the month (assuming it's the same month as the previous 5 visits).\n* One year ago, it would be the 16th of the month one year prior to today.\n\nUsing a calendar, we can see that one year prior to today is February 2009.
