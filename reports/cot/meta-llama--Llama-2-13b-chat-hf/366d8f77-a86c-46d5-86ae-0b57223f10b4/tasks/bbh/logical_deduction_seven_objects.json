Kiwis (second-most expensive)\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe kiwis are the second-most expensive.\n\nFrom this statement, we know that the kiwis are not the most expensive (that's the pears), but they are the second-most expensive.

Let's go through the statements one by one and analyze the information we can gather from each one.\n\nStatement 1: Dan finished third.\n\nFrom this statement, we know that Dan finished in the third position. We don't know where Ana, Ada, Eve, Rob, or Joe finished, but we do know that Dan finished below Rob and above Dan.\n\nStatement 2: Ana finished above Ada.\n\nThis statement tells us that Ana finished higher than Ada. We don't know where Eve, Dan, Rob, or Joe finished, but we do know that Ana finished above Ada.\n\nStatement 3: Amy finished last.\n\nThis statement tells us that Amy finished in the last position. We don't know where the other golfers finished, but we do know that Amy finished last.\n\nStatement 4: Eve finished below Ada.\n\nFrom this statement, we know that Eve finished below Ada. We don't know where the other golfers finished, but we do know that Eve finished below Ada.\n\nStatement 5: Rob finished below Joe.\n\nThis statement tells us that Rob finished below Joe. We don't know where the other golfers finished, but we do know that Rob finished below Joe.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have gathered so far. We know that Dan finished third, Ana finished above Ada, Amy finished last, Eve finished below Ada, and Rob finished below Joe. Based on this information, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (D) because we know that Ana, Eve, and Ada did not finish second.\n\nNext, let's look at the remaining options. Option (C) is still a possibility because we don't know where Ada finished. However, based on the information we have, it's unlikely that Ada finished second because we know that Ana finished above Ada and Eve finished below Ada.\n\nOption (E) is also still a possibility because we don't know where Rob finished. However, based on the information we have, it's unlikely that Rob finished second because we know that Rob finished below Joe.\n\nFinally, option (F) is the most likely answer because we know that Joe finished second based on the information we have.\n\nSo, the answer is (F) Joe finished second.",

This means that she finished below all the other golfers, so we can eliminate option (A) Joe finished second-to-last.\n\nParagraph 3: Mel finished above Mya.\n\nFrom this statement, we know that Mel finished above Mya. This means that Mya finished below Mel, so we can eliminate option (C) Mya finished second-to-last.\n\nParagraph 4: Joe finished second-to-last.\n\nFrom this statement, we know that Joe finished in second-to-last place. This means that he finished above Eve, who finished last, so we can eliminate option (D) Eve finished second-to-last.\n\nParagraph 5: Dan finished above Ada.\n\nFrom this statement, we know that Dan finished above Ada.
