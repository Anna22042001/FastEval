Let's work through the statements one by one to determine the correct answer.\n\nFirst statement: Rob finished above Mya.\n\nThis means that Rob finished in a higher position than Mya. Let's assume that Mya finished in position 5, and Rob finished in position 4.\n\nSecond statement: Eve finished first.\n\nThis means that Eve finished in the top position, let's say position 1.\n\nThird statement: Joe finished above Eli.\n\nThis means that Joe finished in a higher position than Eli. Let's assume that Eli finished in position 3, and Joe finished in position 2.\n\nFourth statement: Joe finished below Mya.\n\nThis means that Joe finished in a lower position than Mya. Since we assumed that Mya finished in position 5, Joe must have finished in position 4.\n\nNow that we have the positions of all the golfers, we can determine the correct answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(E) Mya finished second-to-last.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Rob finished above Mya.\n2. Eve finished first.\n3. Joe finished above Eli.\n4. Joe finished below Mya.\n\nTherefore, Mya finished in position 5, and Rob finished in position 4.",
