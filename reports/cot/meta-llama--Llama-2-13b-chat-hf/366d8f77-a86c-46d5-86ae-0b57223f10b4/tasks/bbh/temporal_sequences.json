To determine the time range when Andrew could have gone to the clothing store, we need to use the information we have about his activities and the times when he was seen at different locations.\n\nStep 1: Identify the time ranges when Andrew was not at the clothing store.\n\nWe know that the clothing store was closed after 9pm, so we can rule out any time ranges that include 9pm or later. Additionally, we know that Andrew was seen at the tennis court from 5am to 6am, at the deli from 6am to 9am, near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 9am to 11am, and at the train station from 11am to 5pm. Therefore, we can rule out any time ranges that overlap with these activities.\n\nStep 2: Identify the time ranges when Andrew was free to go to the clothing store.\n\nThe only time range when Andrew was free to go to the clothing store is between 6pm and 9pm. This is because he was seen at the library from 6pm to 9pm, and the clothing store was closed after 9pm.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer.\n\nBased on the information we have, the correct answer is (B) 6pm to 9pm.
