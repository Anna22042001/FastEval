The coffee shop was closed after 9pm.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information to determine when Susan could have gone to the coffee shop.\n\nFirst, we can eliminated option (A) 6pm to 9pm, since the coffee shop was closed after 9pm, and Susan could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n\nNext, we can eliminated option (B) 7am to 11am, since Susan was seen driving to the water park during this time, and she could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n\nOption (C) 1pm to 2pm is also not possible, since Susan was seen buying lunch at the deli during this time, and she could not have gone to the coffee shop during this time.\n\nNow, we are left with option (D) 2pm to 6pm.

So, Sarah could not have gone to the clothing store after 6pm.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nOption (A) 1pm to 2pm: This option is not possible because Sarah was at the airport from 12pm to 1pm, and then she was taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 2pm to 5pm.\n\nOption (B) 5pm to 6pm: This option is not possible because Sarah was driving to the water park from 5pm to 6pm.\n\nOption (C) 9am to 12pm: This option is not possible because Sarah was buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 12pm.\n\nOption (D) 12pm to 1pm: This option is not possible because Sarah was at the airport from 12pm to 1pm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) None of the above.

Then, Samantha saw Richard sitting on a rooftop from 11am to 2pm. This means that Richard must have left the library sometime before 11am to go to the rooftop.\n4.

Finally, Hannah saw Richard fixing their computer at the electronic store from 4pm to 8pm. This means that Richard must have left the office sometime before 4pm to go to the electronic store.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have to determine the exact time range when Richard could have gone to the physics classroom. Based on the information above, we can conclude that:\n\n* Richard went to the library before 10am.\n* Richard left the library sometime before 11am.\n* Richard went to the rooftop sometime after leaving the library.\n* Richard left the rooftop sometime before 2pm.\n* Richard went to the office sometime after leaving the rooftop.\n* Richard left the office sometime before 4pm.\n* Richard went to the electronic store sometime after leaving the office.\n* Richard left the electronic store sometime before 8pm.\n\nSo, the time range when Richard could have gone to the physics classroom is:\n\n(B) 2pm to 4pm\n\nThis is because Richard had a four-hour gap between leaving the office and going to the electronic store, and the physics classroom was closed after 8pm. Therefore, the only possible time range for Richard to have gone to the physics classroom is 2pm to 4pm.\n\nAnd the answer is... (B) 2pm to 4pm!",

Steven saw Betty buying a bike at the bike shop from 4pm to 5pm. \ud83d\udeb2\n6. Mary saw Betty taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 5pm to 6pm. \ud83d\udcf8\n7. The bookstore was closed after 8pm. \ud83d\udecc\ufe0f\n\nNow, let's find the time window when all of these activities could have taken place. We'll use a diagram to help us visualize the information:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\n\n8am \ud83d\udeeb\ufe0f 10am \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 2pm \ud83d\udcda 4pm \ud83d\udeb2 5pm \ud83d\udcf8 8pm\n\nAs we can see, there are some gaps in the timeline where we know Betty was engaged in specific activities. Let's fill those gaps with the times we know she was doing something:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\n\n8am \ud83d\udeeb\ufe0f 10am \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 2pm \ud83d\udcda 4pm \ud83d\udeb2 5pm \ud83d\udcf8 8pm\n\nNow, let's look at the time window between when Betty could have gone to the bookstore. We know the bookstore was closed after 8pm, so we'll focus on the times before 8pm:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\n\n2pm \ud83d\udcda 4pm \ud83d\udeb2\n\nThese are the only time windows when Betty could have gone to the bookstore, as all other times are taken up by her other activities. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\ud83d\udcdd\n\n(C) 8am to 10am\n\nGreat job! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI hope that helps clarify things. Let me know if you have any other questions! \ud83d\ude0a",
