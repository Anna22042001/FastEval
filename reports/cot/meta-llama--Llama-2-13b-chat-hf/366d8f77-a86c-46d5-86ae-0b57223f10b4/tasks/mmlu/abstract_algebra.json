However, 4 is not distinct from 1, so we need to rearrange the factors. Let's rewrite the factor as (1, 2, 5, 4) = (1, 2, 4, 5).\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the second factor (2, 3).\n\nThis factor is a product of 2 elements, and we can see that both elements are distinct. So, the factor can be written as (2, 3) = 23.\n\nStep 3: Combine the two factors to get the final expression p = (1, 2, 4, 5)23.\n\nNow we need to find the index of p in S_5.\n\nTo do this, we need to find the number of permutations in S_5 that have the same cycle structure as p. In other words, we need to find the number of permutations in S_5 that can be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles, where each cycle is either a single element or a cycle of length 2.\n\nLet's examine the cycle structure of p = (1, 2, 4, 5)23. We can see that p has two cycles:\n\nCycle 1: (1, 2, 4)\nCycle 2: (5, 23)\n\nBoth cycles are of length 2, so we need to find the number of permutations in S_5 that have two disjoint cycles of length 2.\n\nTo do this, we can use the fact that S_5 has 5! = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120 permutations. Of these, 3! = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6 permutations have two disjoint cycles of length 2.\n\nTherefore, the index of p in S_5 is 6.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 2.\n\nBut before I give the final answer, I just want to point out that there's a little detail that might be worth mentioning. In the given expression p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), we can see that the elements 1 and 4 are not distinct. This means that we need to be careful when combining the two factors, as we need to make sure that we are combining them in a way that respects the cycle structure of p.\n\nIn general, when working with permutations, it's important to be mindful of the cycle structure of the permutation and to make sure that we are combining factors in a way that respects the cycle structure.

Here's my step-by-step reasoning for each statement:\n\nStatement 1:\n\nA factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nTo determine whether this statement is true or false, we need to understand what a factor group is. A factor group is a group that is obtained by factoring out a normal subgroup from a larger group. In other words, if we have a group G and a normal subgroup N of G, we can form a factor group G/N by identifying each element of N with the identity element of G/N. Since a normal subgroup is a subset of the original group that is closed under the group operation and contains the identity element of the group, it makes sense that the factor group G/N would also be a group.\n\nNow, let's consider the statement: \"A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\" If we take a non-Abelian group G and form its factor group G/N, where N is a normal subgroup of G, then we know that G/N is also a group. However, we do not necessarily know that G/N is non-Abelian. In other words, we cannot assume that just because G is non-Abelian, then G/N must also be non-Abelian.\n\nFor example, consider the group of integers under addition, Z. This is an Abelian group, but if we take the normal subgroup N = 2Z, then the factor group Z/N is also an Abelian group. Therefore, Statement 1 is False.\n\nStatement 2:\n\nIf K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nThis statement is true. If we have three groups G, H, and K, with K being a normal subgroup of H, and H being a normal subgroup of G, then we can form the factor group G/H and the factor group H/K. Since K is a normal subgroup of H, it must be closed under the group operation, and therefore it is a normal subgroup of G/H. Similarly, since H is a normal subgroup of G, it must be closed under the group operation, and therefore it is a normal subgroup of H/K.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSo, the answer to each statement is:\n\nStatement 1: (C) True, False\nStatement 2: (D) True, True\n\nI hope this helps!

If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. To understand why, let's think about what it means for a group to have an element of order 15. If a group has an element of order 15, it means that there are at least 15 members in the group that are related to each other in a specific way.\n\nIn other words, if a group has an element of order 15, it means that the group has a certain structure or pattern of relationships among its members.

If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it means that there are more than 8 members in the group that are related to each other in a specific way.\n\nIn other words, if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it means that the group has a more complex structure or pattern of relationships among its members. And this structure or pattern must be repeated at least 16 times in the group, because we need at least 16 elements of order 15 to create a coherent and meaningful pattern.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true, because if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15 to create a coherent pattern.\n\nSo, based on our reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(D) False, True",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my reasoning step-by-step, and then I'll provide the answer at the end.\n\nLet's consider Statement 1 first. A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}.\n\nTo understand this statement, we need to recall what a kernel is. In ring theory, the kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements that get mapped to 0 under the homomorphism. In other words, if we have a homomorphism f: R -> S, then the kernel of f, denoted by ker(f), is the set of all a in R such that f(a) = 0.\n\nNow, let's think about what it means for a homomorphism to be one to one. If a homomorphism is one to one, then every element of the domain is mapped to a unique element of the codomain. In other words, if we have two elements a and b in the domain, and f(a) = f(b), then a = b.\n\nSo, how does this relate to the kernel? Well, if we have a homomorphism f: R -> S, and the kernel of f is {0}, then it means that every element of R is mapped to a unique element of S. In other words, there is no element of R that gets mapped to 0 under f.\n\nSo, if we have a homomorphism that is one to one, then the kernel must be {0}. But the converse is also true: if the kernel is {0}, then the homomorphism must be one to one.\n\nNow, let's move on to Statement 2. Q is an ideal in R.\n\nAn ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication by elements of the ring, and contains all the multiples of the ring. In other words, if I is an ideal in R, then for any a, b in I, and any r in R, we have ab in I and ra in I.\n\nSo, let's think about what it means for Q to be an ideal in R. If Q is an ideal in R, then it means that Q is a subset of R that satisfies the properties I mentioned earlier.\n\nNow, the question is, how does this relate to Statement 1? Well, if Q is an ideal in R, then we can define a homomorphism from R to the quotient ring R/Q by sending each element r in R to its coset representative in R/Q. In other words, we can define a homomorphism f: R -> R/Q by setting f(r) = r + Q, where r + Q is the coset representative of r in R/Q.\n\nSo, what can we say about the kernel of this homomorphism? Well, the kernel of f is the set of all elements of R that get mapped to 0 under f. But since Q is an ideal in R, we know that the kernel of f is equal to Q. So, we have f(r) = r + Q, and f(a) = 0 if and only if a is in Q.\n\nSo, we can see that the kernel of f is {0}, which means that the homomorphism is one to one.
