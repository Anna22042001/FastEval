First, we need to identify the statements given in the problem:\n\t* All planets are smaller than Jupiter.\n2. Next, we need to identify the variables and predicates in the problem:\n\t* Variables: x (planet), j (Jupiter)\n\t* Predicates: Px (x is a planet), Sxy (x is smaller than y)\n3. Now, we can translate the statement into predicate logic:\n\nThe statement \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\" can be translated as:\n\n(A) (\u2203x)(Px \u2022 Sxj)\n\nHere, \u2203x represents the existence of a planet x, Px represents the predicate \"x is a planet\", and Sxj represents the predicate \"x is smaller than Jupiter\". The \u2200 symbol (for all) is not necessary because we are not making a universal claim about all planets, but rather a specific claim about the existence of some planet that is smaller than Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is option (A): (\u2203x)(Px \u2022 Sxj).\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",
