As a successor auditor, I want to understand the reasons for the change of auditors and any potential issues that may have led to the change.\n2. The predecessor auditor may have information about the company's management and their integrity that could be relevant to the audit.\n3.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo determine which of the following is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice, we need to consider the purpose of quality control and the key principles of auditing.\n\nQuality control is a process that is designed to ensure that the services provided by a CPA firm meet the highest standards of quality, integrity, and professionalism. It involves a set of policies and procedures that are designed to guide the firm's professionals in the delivery of high-quality services to clients.\n\nAuditing, on the other hand, is a process that is designed to provide an independent assessment of a client's financial statements and internal controls. It involves the application of professional skepticism, which means that the auditor must be mindful of the possibility that material misstatements or errors may exist, and must be willing to challenge management's assumptions and conclusions.\n\nNow, let's consider the four options presented:\n\n(A) Acceptance of a client relationship.\n\nAcceptance of a client relationship is an important aspect of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures, as it helps to ensure that the firm only accepts clients that are a good fit for its expertise and resources. However, this is not an element of the firm's auditing practice specifically.\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management.\n\nProfessional skepticism is a fundamental principle of auditing, and it requires that the auditor approach the engagement with a healthy dose of skepticism, questioning management's assumptions and conclusions, and being willing to challenge them if necessary. This is an essential element of a CPA firm's auditing practice.\n\n(C) Computer information processing.\n\nComputer information processing is a tool that is used in the auditing process to analyze and process large amounts of data. While it is an important aspect of the auditing process, it is not an element of the firm's quality control policies and procedures specifically.\n\n(D) Efficiency of organizational structures.\n\nThe efficiency of organizational structures is an important aspect of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures, as it helps to ensure that the firm is operating effectively and efficiently. However, this is not an element of the firm's auditing practice specifically.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management.\n\nI hope this helps!

Shareholders have the right to inspect certain corporate records and documents, such as the balance sheet, income statement, and minutes of board meetings.\n2. This right is not absolute, meaning that there are limitations and conditions that must be met in order to exercise this right.\n3. One of the conditions is that the demand to inspect must be for a proper purpose. This means that the shareholder must have a legitimate reason for wanting to inspect the records, such as to assess the financial health of the company or to investigate potential wrongdoing.\n4. The demand to inspect must be made in writing and must specify the records or documents that the shareholder wants to inspect.\n5. The company has the right to deny the demand if it is not for a proper purpose or if the requested records are not available.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.\n\nThe answer is (C).",

First, we need to determine the amount of the check that was not included in the December 31 checkbook balance. This is the check for $4000 payable to Rune postdated January 3. Since it was not included in the December 31 balance, we need to add it back in.\n2. Next, we need to subtract the amount of the check that was returned by the bank. This is the check for $1000 payable to Rune deposited on December 15 and returned by the bank on December 30 stamped \"NSF\". We know that the check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9, but for now, we'll assume that it was not cleared by December 31.\n3. So, the adjusted checkbook balance on December 31 would be:\n\n$10,000 (initial balance) + $4,000 (check not included in December 31 balance) - $1,000 (check returned by bank) = $13,000\n\nTherefore, the amount of cash that Rune should report in its December 31 balance sheet is $13,000.\n\nAnd the answer is:\n\n(C) $13,000",

This is the amount that Strom contributed to Ace, which includes the adjusted basis of the land and any other assets contributed.\n2. The adjusted basis of the land is $16,000, which is the original cost of the land minus any depreciation or other expenses.\n3. The fair market value of the land is $50,000, which is the amount that the land would sell for on the open market.\n4. The mortgage on the land is $24,000, which was assumed by Ace Partnership. This means that Strom's basis in Ace Partnership includes the adjusted basis of the land ($16,000) plus the amount of the mortgage assumed ($24,000).\n5.
