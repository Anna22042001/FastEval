            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total number of hours the limousine will be hired per year. Since you plan to rent it for 2 hours per day, and there are 365 days in a year (including weekends and festivities), the total number of hours per year is:\n\n2 hours/day x 365 days/year = 730 hours/year\n2. Next, we need to calculate the total revenue the limousine will generate per year. Since you plan to charge $245 per hour, and the limousine will be hired for 730 hours per year, the total revenue is:\n\n730 hours/year x $245/hour = $180,250/year\n3. Now, we need to calculate the total daily costs for the limousine. You mentioned that the daily costs are around $50, so the total daily costs for the year are:\n\n$50/day x 365 days/year = $18,250/year\n4. Finally, we can calculate the estimated yearly yield on your investment by subtracting the total daily costs from the total revenue:\n\n$180,250/year - $18,250/year = $162,000/year\n\nSo, the estimated yearly yield on your investment is $162,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) $162,000.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step explanation of the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise on Arno's balance sheet at year end:\n\n1. The merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, so we know that the inventory balance at the end of the year is correct.\n2. However, since the purchase of merchandise was not recorded as a credit purchase, we need to consider the effect of this omission on the balance sheet.\n3. The balance sheet equates to assets = liabilities + equity. Therefore, if we ignore the purchase of merchandise, we will have an understatement of assets.\n4. Assets include inventory, which is the correct amount based on the year-end physical inventory. Therefore, the only asset that is affected by the omission is the merchandise purchase.\n5. Since the merchandise purchase was not recorded as a credit purchase, it is not included in the assets section of the balance sheet.\n6. Therefore, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise has an understatement effect on Assets.\n\nNow, based on the above explanation, what is the effect of the omission on Arno's balance sheet at year end?\n\nThe answer is B) Understated Assets.",

            "model_answer": "Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with your question.\n\nTo start, let's break down the question into its components:\n\n1. The question is asking about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer.\n2. The question provides four statements about audit sampling risks, labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement one by one to determine which one is correct for a nonissuer.\n\nStatement A: Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nThis statement is not correct for a nonissuer. Nonsampling risk is not a concern for a nonissuer, as they do not have any direct involvement in the audit process.\n\nStatement B: Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nThis statement is not correct for a nonissuer either. Nonsampling risk is not relevant to a nonissuer, as they do not have any responsibility for recognizing misstatements in financial statements.\n\nStatement C: Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nThis statement is partially correct, but it is not the best answer for a nonissuer. While sampling risk does involve uncertainty in applying audit procedures, it is not the primary risk concern for a nonissuer.\n\nStatement D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nThis statement is the correct answer for a nonissuer. Sampling risk can arise when the auditor selects audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective, such as detecting material misstatements in financial statements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for a nonissuer is Statement D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nSo, to summarize, the correct answer is D: Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nI hope this explanation and breakdown of the statements helps clarify the correct answer for you!",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine the project's cash flows. We know that the project will cost $500 today, and it will generate profits of $500 in years five and ten. So, the cash flows for the project are:\n\nYear 1: -$500 (initial investment)\nYear 5: +$500 (profit)\nYear 10: +$500 (profit)\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the present value of each cash flow using a discount rate of 10%. The present value of a future cash flow is calculated using the formula:\n\nPresent Value = Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^Year\n\nSo, let's apply this formula to each cash flow:\n\nYear 1: -$500 / (1 + 0.10)^1 = -$500\nYear 5: +$500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $454.54 (rounded to two decimal places)\nYear 10: +$500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 = $645.16 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\n3. Now, we need to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the project. The NPV is the sum of the present values of all cash flows. So, we add up the present values of each cash flow:\n\nNPV = -$500 + $454.54 + $645.16 = $1,599.60\n\n4. Finally, we need to compare the NPV to the initial investment to determine if the project is profitable. Since the NPV is positive ($1,599.60), the project is profitable.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) $500 (the initial investment)\n\nI hope that helps!

It assumes that the bond premium decreases evenly over the life of the bond.\n2. The effective interest method, on the other hand, is a more complex method that takes into account the present value of future cash flows and the bond's issuance date. It is a more accurate method for bonds with long maturities or those that have a high premium.\n3.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! To calculate the price of a three-year bond, we'll need to use a formula that takes into account the face value of the bond, the coupon rate, and the yield.\n\nHere's the formula:\n\nPrice = Face Value / (1 + (Coupon Rate / 2)^Years)\n\nIn this case, the face value of the bond is $100, the coupon rate is 5%, and the years is 3.\n\nSo, let's break down the calculation step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the present value of the bond's coupons. The coupon rate is 5%, so the present value of each coupon is:\n\n$100 x 5% = $5\n\nThere are three coupons altogether, so the present value of all the coupons is:\n\n$5 x 3 = $15\n2. Next, we need to calculate the present value of the bond's face value. Since the bond has a face value of $100 and the yield is 6%, we can use the yield to calculate the present value of the face value:\n\n$100 x (1 + (6% / 2)^3) = $100 x (1 + 3 x 6%) = $100 x 1.8 = $180\n\nThe present value of the bond's face value is $180.\n3. Now, we add the present value of the coupons to the present value of the face value to get the total present value of the bond:\n\n$180 + $15 = $195\n\nSo, the total present value of the bond is $195.\n\nFinally, we can output the answer:\n\nThe price of the three-year bond (face value $100), paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6% is:\n\n(B) $104.29\n\nThe reasoning behind the answer is as follows:\n\nWe know that the present value of the bond's coupons is $15, and the present value of the bond's face value is $180. Therefore, the total present value of the bond is $195.\n\nTo find the price of the bond, we can use the formula:\n\nPrice = Face Value / (1 + (Coupon Rate / 2)^Years)\n\nIn this case, the face value is $100, the coupon rate is 5%, and the years is 3.\n\nPlugging in these values, we get:\n\nPrice = $100 / (1 + (5% / 2)^3) = $100 / (1 + 3 x 5%) = $100 / 15 = $104.29\n\nTherefore, the price of the three-year bond (face value $100), paying 5% coupons, with a yield of 6% is $104.29.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let me step through the options one by one and explain my reasoning.\n\n(A) It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale: This statement is correct. When a company decides to sell a long-lived asset, such as a building, the asset is typically reclassified as \"held for sale\" on the balance sheet. This means that the asset is no longer being depreciated, as it is no longer being used in the company's operations, and its value is being actively marketed.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset: This statement is incorrect. As the company is not expecting to complete the sale of the building within the next year (it expects to complete the sale in four months), the building should not be classified as a current asset. Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash within the next year, and the building does not meet this criterion.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated: This statement is correct. As the building is being held for sale and is no longer being used in the company's operations, depreciation on the building should cease.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost: This statement is incorrect. The building's value should be based on its current market value, not its historical cost. The historical cost of the building may not reflect its current market value, especially if the building has been improved or if market conditions have changed since the building was acquired.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) It will be valued at historical cost. The other options are all incorrect because the building will be reclassified as an asset held for sale, it will not be classified as a current asset, depreciation on the building will cease, and the building's value will be based on its current market value rather than its historical cost.\n\nThe answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of income that the corporation would have reportable income if it were an S corporation. We can calculate this by multiplying the corporation's taxable income by the corporation's tax rate.\n\nAssuming a tax rate of 21% (the current federal corporate tax rate for C corporations), we can calculate the corporation's reportable income as follows:\n\n$400,000 x 21% = $84,000\n\nNext, we need to determine how much of this income would be distributed to Carson as a shareholder. Based on the information provided, the corporation distributed $70,000 in cash dividends to its shareholders. Since Carson owns 40% of the outstanding stock, we can calculate his share of the dividends as follows:\n\n$70,000 x 40% = $28,000\n\nFinally, we need to determine how much of this dividend income would be reportable on Carson's individual tax return. As an S corporation, the distributions to the owners would be proportionate to their ownership percentage. Therefore, we can calculate Carson's reportable income as follows:\n\n$28,000 / 40% = $70,000 (the total amount of dividends distributed to all shareholders)\n\nSince Carson already reported $28,000 in gross income on his individual tax return, we can subtract this amount from the total amount of dividends distributed to him:\n\n$70,000 - $28,000 = $42,000\n\nTherefore, if the corporation had been an S corporation and the distributions to the owners had been proportionate, Carson would have reported $42,000 in income on his individual tax return.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) $42,000.",
