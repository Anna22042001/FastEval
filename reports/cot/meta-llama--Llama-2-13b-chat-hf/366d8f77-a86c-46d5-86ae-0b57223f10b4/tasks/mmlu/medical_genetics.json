            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nThe question is asking for the estimated number of human protein-coding genes. To answer this, we need to understand that the number of genes in the human genome is not a fixed number and has been the subject of much research and debate.\n\nThe most recent estimate of the number of human protein-coding genes was made by a team of researchers in 2015, who used a technique called \"RNA sequencing\" to count the number of genes in human cells. They found that there are approximately 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this estimate may be reduced over time as new research and technologies become available. For example, some studies have suggested that the number of protein-coding genes may be lower than previously thought, possibly around 10,000-15,000.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the best answer is (B) 19,000-20,000.\n\nAnswer: (B) 19,000-20,000.",

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.\n2. The CFTR gene provides instructions for making a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.\n3. This protein helps regulate the movement of salt and water in and out of cells, particularly in the respiratory and digestive systems.\n4. The most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is a substitution mutation, which involves the replacement of one amino acid with another.\n5. This specific mutation, known as the F508del mutation, accounts for approximately 70% of all cystic fibrosis cases.\n6. The F508del mutation results in the production of a defective CFTR protein that is unable to function properly.\n7. As a result, the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis, such as persistent lung infections and digestive problems, develop.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) a substitution.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for the answer:\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with body mass index (BMI). However, despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies, known SNPs explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI.\n\nLet's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. GWAS have identified many SNPs associated with BMI.\n2. BMI is a complex trait with a heritability of greater than 50% from twin and family studies.\n3. Known SNPs explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI.\n\nBased on these points, we can infer that while GWAS have identified many SNPs associated with BMI, these SNPs do not explain a large proportion of the variation in BMI. This suggests that there are likely many other genetic and environmental factors that contribute to BMI, and that the known SNPs are only a small part of the overall picture.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer options:\n\n(A) only 5%: This is too low, as we know that known SNPs explain more than 5% of the variation in BMI.\n\n(B) less than 1%: This is also too low, as we know that known SNPs explain more than 1% of the variation in BMI.\n\n(C) only 13%: This is closer to the correct answer, but still too high. We know that known SNPs explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI, so 13% is too high.\n\n(D) less than 2%: This is the correct answer. Known SNPs explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI, and less than 2% is a reasonable estimate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) less than 2%.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo determine the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria, we need to understand the condition and how it affects the body. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). If PKU is left untreated, Phe can build up in the blood and brain, leading to serious health problems and developmental delays.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: What is the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to know the likelihood of the mother passing on the PKU gene to her child. PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that a child needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the condition.\n\nIf the mother has PKU and is not treated, there is a high risk that she will pass on the mutated gene to her child. In fact, the risk of a child inheriting the PKU gene from an unaffected carrier mother (like the one described in the question) is about 25%.\n\nSo, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is:\n\n(C) 25%\n\nTherefore, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit the PKU gene from the mother and develop the condition. It's important to note that if the mother is treated for PKU during pregnancy, the risk of the child developing the condition can be significantly reduced.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism. The question asks what gene is mutated, so let's think about what we know about cholesterol metabolism.\n\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and intestines through a process that involves several enzymes. One of these enzymes is HMG-CoA reductase, which converts HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA) to mevalonate. Mevalonate is then used to synthesize cholesterol.\n\nTherefore, the gene that encodes HMG-CoA reductase is a good candidate for being mutated in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Let's check the options:\n\n(A) High density lipoprotein: HDL is not involved in cholesterol synthesis, so this option is not correct.\n\n(B) HMG-CoA reductase: This is the correct answer! Mutations in the HMG-CoA reductase gene can lead to familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\n(C) Low density lipoprotein: LDL is not involved in cholesterol synthesis either, so this option is not correct.\n\n(D) Low density lipoprotein receptor: The LDL receptor is involved in the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream into the liver, but it is not involved in cholesterol synthesis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) HMG-CoA reductase.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nQTL analysis is a powerful tool used in genetics to identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross. The term QTL stands for \"Quantitative Trait Locus,\" and it refers to the specific location on a chromosome where a gene or genes that contribute to a particular trait are located.\n\nTo perform a QTL analysis, researchers typically use a genetic cross between two parental lines that differ in the trait of interest. For example, if the researchers are studying the trait of height in a crop plant, they might cross two inbred lines that differ in height. The offspring of this cross will have a mix of genetic material from both parents, and the trait of interest (height) will be expressed in each individual.\n\nThe next step is to genotype the offspring at multiple loci across the genome to determine the genetic makeup of each individual. This is typically done using molecular markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are small changes in the DNA sequence that can be easily identified.\n\nOnce the genotype data has been collected, the researchers can use statistical methods to identify the chromosome regions that are associated with the trait of interest. This is done by comparing the genotype data between individuals that exhibit the trait and those that do not. The goal is to identify the specific chromosome regions that are more commonly found in individuals that exhibit the trait.\n\nSo, to summarize the steps involved in QTL analysis:\n\n1. Perform a genetic cross between two parental lines that differ in the trait of interest.\n2. Genotype the offspring at multiple loci across the genome.\n3. Use statistical methods to identify the chromosome regions associated with the trait of interest.\n\nNow, based on the information provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!

Hfr strains of E. coli do not contain vectors of yeast or bacterial origin. Vectors are tools used to introduce genetic material into cells, but they are not found in the cells themselves.\n\n(B) A bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted.\n\nThis is also not correct.

While it is possible to introduce human genes into bacteria, it is not a common practice, and it is not what is described in this question.\n\n(C) A bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.\n\nThis is correct! The F factor is a piece of DNA that is found in some bacteria, including E. coli, and it is responsible for the ability of the bacteria to take up and integrate foreign DNA into their own genome. Hfr strains of E. coli have an extra copy of the F factor, which allows them to undergo recombination more frequently than other strains of E. coli.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) A bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.\n\nI hope this helps!

To determine the cause of LHO, we need to look at the genetic material that is responsible for the condition.\n\nStep 1: Let's start by looking at the location of the mutation. LHO is caused by a mutation in a specific gene, but we don't know which gene yet.\n\nStep 2: The mutation is located on a specific chromosome. Chromosomes are long, thread-like structures that contain our genetic material. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in every human cell, and each chromosome has a specific number of genes.\n\nStep 3: We know that the mutation responsible for LHO is located on a specific chromosome, but we don't know which one. Let's look at the four options provided:\n\nOption A: chromosome 12\nOption B: chromosome 18\nOption C: chromosome 21\nOption D: mitochondrial DNA\n\nStep 4: We can eliminate Option D: mitochondrial DNA, because mitochondrial DNA is not involved in the inheritance of LHO. Mitochondrial DNA is found in the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's look at the remaining options. We know that LHO is caused by a mutation in a specific gene, but we don't know which gene yet. We can eliminate Option A: chromosome 12, because there is no known gene on this chromosome that is associated with LHO.\n\nStep 6: We can also eliminate Option C: chromosome 21, because there is no known gene on this chromosome that is associated with LHO.\n\nStep 7: This leaves us with Option B: chromosome 18.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step explanation of how an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in:\n\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population\n\nWhen there is an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, it means that the individuals in the population are more closely related to each other. This can lead to a reduction in the number of heterozygotes (individuals with two different alleles) in the population. This is because when individuals are more closely related, they are more likely to have the same alleles for a particular gene, which means they will be homozygous (have two of the same alleles) rather than heterozygous.\n\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage\n\nWhen there is an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, it also means that the genes in the population are more likely to be linked together. This is because linkage occurs when two or more genes are located close together on the same chromosome, and when individuals are more closely related, they are more likely to have the same chromosomal arrangement. As a result, the proportion of genes that show linkage will be higher in a population with a higher inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(C) higher proportion of genes with introns\n\nIntrons are regions of non-coding DNA that are located within genes. They are removed during the process of splicing, which takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. When there is an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, it can lead to an increase in the number of introns in the genes of the population. This is because introns are more likely to be retained in the genes of closely related individuals, as they are less likely to be removed through splicing.\n\n(D) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells\n\nThis is not correct. An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is not likely to result in a higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells. In fact, the opposite is true - when there is a higher inbreeding coefficient, the RNA molecules in the daughter cells are more likely to be similar, as the individuals are more closely related.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",

The most common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion of one or two bases in the HBA1 or HBA2 genes.\n3.
