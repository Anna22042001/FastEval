            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravitation proposed by Albert Einstein, which describes how mass and energy warp the fabric of spacetime. One of the key predictions of general relativity is that gravity is not a force, but rather the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.\n\nNow, let's apply this theory to the question at hand. The question asks about light and its behavior in the presence of the Sun.\n\nStep 1: Light leaving the Sun is not slowed by gravity.\n\nAccording to general relativity, the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun's mass and energy only affects objects that are in close proximity to the Sun. Since light is massless and has no rest mass, it is not affected by the Sun's gravity, and therefore, it is not slowed down by the Sun's gravity.\n\nStep 2: Light passing the Sun is deflected.\n\nHowever, the situation changes when light passes near the Sun. According to general relativity, the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun's mass and energy can bend light around the Sun. This effect, known as gravitational lensing, causes light to follow a curved path around the Sun, rather than traveling in a straight line.\n\nStep 3: A clock on the Sun's surface runs faster than on Earth.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the effect of the Sun's gravity on clocks. According to general relativity, the stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes. Since the Sun's gravity is much stronger than Earth's, a clock on the Sun's surface would run faster than a clock on Earth.\n\nNow, let's put all these steps together to find the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Light passing the Sun is deflected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Light passing the Sun is deflected.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the reasoning behind the answer. Let me know if you have any further questions!",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nA galvanometer is a type of instrument used to measure electric current. To calibrate a galvanometer means to adjust its sensitivity and accuracy so that it can accurately measure the current being measured.\n\nNow, let's think about what the galvanometer is measuring. Electric current is a flow of electrons, and it is measured in units of amperes (A). Voltage, on the other hand, is the potential difference between two points in a circuit, and it is measured in units of volts (V).\n\nSo, if a galvanometer is calibrated to read electric current, it means that it is set up to measure the amount of current flowing through a circuit. This current can be either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) current.\n\nHere's the answer in a single letter with parentheses:\n\n(A)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nWhen an element ejects a beta particle, it undergoes a process called beta decay. In beta decay, an electron from the inner electron shell of the atom is emitted, resulting in a new atom with a different number of electrons.\n\nNow, let's think about what happens to the atomic number of the element after beta decay. The atomic number of an element is the number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom. Since the number of protons in the nucleus remains the same during beta decay, the atomic number of the element does not change.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) reduces by 1. The atomic number of the element does not change after beta decay.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) reduces by 1.",

The closed loop of wire is called a coil.\n2. When the magnetic field around the coil changes, the magnetic field induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil.\n3. The EMF in the coil causes a flow of electrons, or a current, to move through the wire.\n4.

Complementary colors are pairs of colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When you place a complementary color next to each other, they create a strong contrast and can make each other appear more vibrant.\n\nBlue is a primary color, so it is located at one of the three primary points on the color wheel.

When an aircraft is flying at supersonic speeds, it produces a sonic boom.\n2. The sonic boom is caused by the shockwaves that form when the aircraft breaks the sound barrier.\n3. The shockwaves are created when the aircraft's speed exceeds the speed of sound, causing the air to compress and expand rapidly.\n4. As the aircraft continues to fly supersonic, it maintains a constant speed and the shockwaves continue to form, producing a continuous sonic boom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) breaking the sound barrier.\n\nThe answer is (A) breaking the sound barrier.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo determine the correct answer, let's think about how a barometer works. A barometer measures air pressure, and it does so by using a column of a heavy liquid (usually mercury) that is supported by the weight of the air above it. The height of the column is directly proportional to the air pressure.\n\nNow, let's consider a barometer that uses water instead of mercury. Water is less dense than mercury, so it will take up more space for the same amount of weight. This means that the column of water will be taller than the column of mercury for the same air pressure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) taller. The barometer that uses water instead of mercury will be taller than a traditional barometer because the water column will be taller for the same air pressure.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) taller.",

In a fusion reaction, two nuclei combine to form a single, heavier nucleus. This process releases energy because the combined nucleus has a lower mass than the two original nuclei.\n2. The energy released in a fusion reaction is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the particles produced. In this case, the reaction produces an alpha particle (which is a high-energy helium nucleus) and a neutron.\n3. The alpha particle is produced with a high kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. This energy is transferred from the nucleus to the alpha particle as it is emitted.\n4. The neutron is also produced with a high kinetic energy, but to a lesser extent than the alpha particle. This is because the neutron is not as massive as the alpha particle, so it does not require as much energy to produce.\n5. Therefore, the majority of the energy released in the fusion reaction is in the form of the kinetic energy of the alpha particle.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) kinetic energy of the alpha particle.\n\nI hope this helps!

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Satellites in circular Earth orbit are in a state of constant freefall around the Earth. This means that they are under the influence of the Earth's gravitational force, which pulls them towards the center of the planet.\n2. The key thing to note here is that the gravitational force on a satellite in circular orbit is not zero, but it is constantly directed towards the center of the Earth. This means that the satellite is constantly being pulled towards the center of the Earth, but it is also constantly moving in a circular path around the planet.\n3. As a result of this constant pull towards the center of the Earth, the satellite's speed remains constant. This is because the gravitational force is always acting towards the center of the Earth, and it is not changing the satellite's velocity in any way.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface. The gravitational force on a satellite in circular orbit is weaker than it would be at the Earth's surface, but it is still present and constantly acting on the satellite.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface.",
