            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2017, the total population of the United States was approximately 325 million people.\n2. The Census Bureau defines urban areas as \"cities, towns, and villages with a population of at least 2,500.\"\n3. Using this definition, the Census Bureau estimated that in 2017, about 81% of the total U.S. population lived in urban areas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 82%.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 82%.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo determine the correct answer, let's first look at the global fertility rate as of 2015. According to the World Bank, the total fertility rate (TFR) for the world as a whole in 2015 was approximately 2.5 children per woman.\n\nSo, based on this information, we can eliminate options (A) and (D), as they are both lower than the actual global fertility rate.\n\nNow, let's compare the remaining options. Option (C) is also lower than the actual global fertility rate, so we can eliminate that one as well.\n\nThis leaves us with option (B), which is the correct answer. The global fertility rate as of 2015 was approximately 2.5 children per woman.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo determine which of the following mental disorders is most prevalent in the world, we need to look at the prevalence rates of each disorder. Prevalence rates are the percentage of people in a given population who have a specific disorder at a given time.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence rates of the four disorders you mentioned are as follows:\n\n* Bipolar disorder: 1.3% of the global population (approximately 97 million people)\n* Schizophrenia: 0.3% of the global population (approximately 21 million people)\n* Alcohol use disorders: 2.3% of the global population (approximately 175 million people)\n* Anxiety disorders: 4.4% of the global population (approximately 315 million people)\n\nBased on these prevalence rates, the most prevalent mental disorder in the world is anxiety disorders, with a prevalence rate of 4.4% of the global population.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Anxiety disorders.\n\nI hope this helps!

To answer this question, I'll need to provide some context and explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nFirst, it's important to note that the question is asking about survey respondents from Mexico, and the time period being referred to is 2017.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's Enterprise Survey, which collects data on the business environment and entrepreneurship in developing countries, including Mexico, the percentage of respondents who reported paying a bribe in the last year to access public services in Mexico as of 2017 was:\n\n(C) 71%\n\nThis means that out of every 100 survey respondents from Mexico, 71 reported paying a bribe to access public services in the last year.\n\nIt's important to note that this data is based on self-reported responses and may not reflect the actual prevalence of bribery in Mexico, as some respondents may not have reported bribery incidents for various reasons.
