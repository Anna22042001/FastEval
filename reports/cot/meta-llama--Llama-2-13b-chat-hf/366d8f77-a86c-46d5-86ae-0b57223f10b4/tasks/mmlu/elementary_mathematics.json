The distance is given in meters, so we know that the value of the 4 in the tens place is 40 (4 x 10).\n3. The distance is also given in decimals, so we know that the value of the 4 in the tenths place is 4 (4 x 0.1).\n4. Since the distance is given as 444.44 meters, we know that the value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 4 (4 x 0.01).\n5.

Bus A has a long route and leaves the station every 75 minutes, so the first departure time for Bus A is 6:00 a.m. (the starting time).\n2. Bus B has a short route and leaves the station every 15 minutes, so the first departure time for Bus B is 6:15 a.m. (15 minutes after the starting time).\n3. Since Bus A has a longer route, it takes more time to complete one round. Therefore, the next departure time for Bus A after the first departure at 6:00 a.m. will be 75 minutes later, at 7:15 a.m. (6:00 a.m. + 75 minutes).\n4. Bus B, on the other hand, has a shorter route and leaves the station more frequently. The next departure time for Bus B after the first departure at 6:15 a.m. will be 15 minutes later, at 6:30 a.m. (6:15 a.m. + 15 minutes).\n5. To find the next time when both Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time, we need to find the next time when the departure time of Bus A (7:15 a.m.) is equal to the departure time of Bus B (6:30 a.m.).\n\nTherefore, the next time when Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time is:\n\n(C) 7:30 a.m.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 7:30 a.m.",

In this case, the variable is \"w\".\n\nStep 2: Next, let's think about what the equation is saying. The equation is saying that 14 is equal to \"w\" plus 23.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's consider the possible values of \"w\". If \"w\" is a positive integer, then the equation becomes:\n\n14 = w + 23\n\nWe know that 14 is a positive integer, so we can start by trying to find a value of \"w\" that makes the equation true.\n\nStep 4: Let's try \"w\" = 0. If \"w\" = 0, then the equation becomes:\n\n14 = 0 + 23\n\nThis equation is not true, so we can rule out \"w\" = 0.\n\nStep 5: Let's try \"w\" = 1. If \"w\" = 1, then the equation becomes:\n\n14 = 1 + 23\n\nThis equation is still not true, so we can rule out \"w\" = 1.\n\nStep 6: Let's try \"w\" = 2. If \"w\" = 2, then the equation becomes:\n\n14 = 2 + 23\n\nThis equation is still not true, so we can rule out \"w\" = 2.\n\nStep 7: As we have tried all the positive integers up to 2, we can conclude that there is no positive integer value of \"w\" that makes the equation true.\n\nStep 8: Therefore, the only possible answer is (D) 37, which is the negative of the equation.\n\nSo, the answer to the equation 14 = w + 23 is (D) 37.\n\nI hope this helps!

We can use this information to calculate the total distance they hiked.\n\n144 minutes / 2.5 miles/hour = 57.6 miles\n\nNow, we need to round this distance to the nearest tenth of a mile.
