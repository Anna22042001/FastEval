            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand what the equation 24 = 2p is saying. The equation states that 24 is equal to 2 times some value p.\n\nFirst, let's think about what value of p could make the equation true. If we have 24, and we multiply it by 2, we get 48. So, the value of p that makes the equation true is 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the options given:\n\n(A) p = 4\n(B) p = 8\n(C) p = 12\n(D) p = 24\n\nOf these options, only (A) p = 4 is correct, because 24 = 2(4).\n\nTherefore, the value of p is (A) 4.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) 4.",

            "model_answer": "Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo begin, let's analyze the information given in the question. Ms. Perez drove a total of 40 miles in 5 days, which means she drove the same number of miles each day. This tells us that Ms. Perez drove 40/5 = 8 miles each day.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 8 miles per day.\n\nNow, let me confirm that my reasoning is correct. To do this, I will test my answer using the given options.\n\nOption (A) 5 miles per day is not correct because it is less than the total distance driven (40 miles) and the given information states that Ms. Perez drove the same number of miles each day.\n\nOption (B) 7 miles per day is also not correct because it is not equal to the total distance driven (40 miles) and the given information states that Ms. Perez drove the same number of miles each day.\n\nOption (D) 9 miles per day is not correct because it is more than the total distance driven (40 miles) and the given information states that Ms. Perez drove the same number of miles each day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 8 miles per day.\n\n\ud83d\ude0a",

First, let's analyze the information given: we have four tickets, and the total cost is $112.\n2. We know that each ticket costs $448, so we can set up an equation based on that:\n\n4t = 112 (where t is the cost of one ticket)\n3. Now, we can solve for t by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n\nt = 112 / 4\n\n4.
