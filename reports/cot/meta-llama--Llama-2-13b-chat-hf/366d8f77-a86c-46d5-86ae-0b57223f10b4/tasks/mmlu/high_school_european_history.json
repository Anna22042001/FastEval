The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me.

I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that\n\n(A) society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it\n(B) a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature\n(C) the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property\n(D) only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness",

            "model_answer": "Thank you for your question. I'll be happy to help you with it.\n\nTo begin, let's take a closer look at the passage you provided. The passage describes the Committee of Public Safety's efforts to mobilize the French people for the war effort during the French Revolution. The Committee is authorized to form new establishments, factories, workshops, and mills, and to put in requisition artists and workingmen from throughout the Republic. The representatives of the people sent out to execute the law are invested with unlimited powers, similar to those of the representatives of the people to the armies.\n\nNow, based on this information, let's analyze the four options you provided:\n\n(A) revamped the economy of the new French Republic: The passage does not mention anything about revamping the economy. While the Committee of Public Safety is authorized to form new establishments and put in requisition artists and workingmen, there is no mention of economic reforms. Therefore, option (A) is not a correct interpretation of the passage.\n\n(B) successfully harnessed the human resources of the new French Republic: This is a correct interpretation of the passage. The Committee of Public Safety is authorized to mobilize the French people for the war effort, and the representatives of the people sent out to execute the law are invested with unlimited powers. This suggests that the Committee was successful in harnessing the human resources of the new French Republic. Therefore, option (B) is a correct answer.\n\n(C) reformed the religious rituals of the Church in the new French Republic: The passage does not mention anything about religious rituals or the Church. The focus is solely on the mobilization of the French people for the war effort. Therefore, option (C) is not a correct interpretation of the passage.\n\n(D) brought about its own destruction: The passage does not mention anything about the destruction of the Committee of Public Safety. While the representatives of the people sent out to execute the law are invested with unlimited powers, there is no suggestion that this led to the destruction of the Committee. Therefore, option (D) is not a correct interpretation of the passage.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is option (B) successfully harnessed the human resources of the new French Republic.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nFirst we must remark that the cosmos is spherical in form, partly because this form being a perfect whole requiring no joints, is the most complete of all, partly because it makes the most capacious form, which is best suited to contain and preserve everything; or again because all the constituent parts of the universe, that is the sun, moon and the planets appear in this form; or because everything strives to attain this form, as appears in the case of drops of water and other fluid bodies if they attempt to define themselves. So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\n\n(A) observation and induction\n(B) ancient textual authority\n(C) experimentation\n(D) deduction from first principles",

We then discoursed of the circulation of the blood, the valves in the veins, the venae lactae, the lymphatic vessels, the Copernican hypothesis, the nature of comets and new stars, the satellites of Jupiter, the oval shape (as it then appeared) of Saturn, the spots in the sun, and its turning on its own axis, the inequalities and selenography of the moon, the several phases of Venus and Mercury, the improvement of telescopes, and grinding of glasses for that purpose, the weight of air, the possibility, or impossibility of vacuities, and nature's abhorrence thereof, the Torricellian experiment in quicksilver, the descent of heavy bodies, and the degrees of acceleration therein; and divers other things of like nature.

In fact, the report suggests that the inhabitants were unable to relieve the sick persons, which implies that the agricultural practices were not sufficient to meet the needs of the population. Therefore, we can rule out this option.\n\n(B) Adverse weather: The report does mention that there was a famine, which suggests that adverse weather conditions may have played a role in the health and hunger problems. However, the report does not provide any specific information about the weather conditions, so we cannot determine the extent to which adverse weather contributed to the problems. Therefore, we cannot rule out this option.\n\n(C) Low taxes on the peasants and middle class: The report does not mention anything about taxes, so we cannot consider this option.\n\n(D) Poor transportation: The report does mention that the inhabitants were unable to relieve the sick persons, which suggests that poor transportation may have been a contributing factor to the health and hunger problems. However, the report does not provide any specific information about the transportation infrastructure, so we cannot determine the extent to which poor transportation contributed to the problems.

Lenin's speech. Lenin emphasizes the importance of industrialization for the Soviet Union's defense and socialist construction. He argues that the country cannot rely on a scattered and backward small commodity economy of peasants, but rather needs to develop a more highly technical and large-scale industrial basis.\n\nNow, let's consider the four options provided:\n\n(A) His exile in Switzerland and other places led him to see how the industrialization of the West was needed in the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile Lenin did spend time in exile, there is no direct evidence to suggest that his experiences abroad influenced his desire to industrialize the Soviet Union. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A) as the greatest influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize.\n\n(B) Russia had a large percentage of its population working in factories before the revolution occurred, and he wanted to build on that.\n\nThis statement is partially correct. Prior to the Russian Revolution, Russia did have a significant percentage of its population working in factories, primarily in the textile and mining industries. However, Lenin's desire to industrialize the Soviet Union was not solely based on this existing industrial base. Therefore, option (B) is not the greatest influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize.\n\n(C) Trotsky was able to lead the Bolshevik revolt in 1917 because he had control of the rail and telegraph stations.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. While Trotsky did play a significant role in the Bolshevik revolt, he did not have control of the rail and telegraph stations. Therefore, option (C) is not the greatest influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize.\n\n(D) The humiliating defeat of Russia during the First World War had led to his rise to power and he knew another defeat would spell his doom.\n\nThis statement is partially correct. The First World War did lead to a significant decline in Russia's economy and military power, which contributed to Lenin's rise to power. However, Lenin's desire to industrialize the Soviet Union was not solely motivated by a desire to avoid another defeat. Therefore, option (D) is not the greatest influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize.\n\nBased on the information provided, the greatest influence on Lenin's desire to industrialize the Soviet Union was:\n\n(E) The need for a more highly developed technical industrial basis for defense and socialist construction.\n\nThis answer is based on the explicit statements made by Lenin in the excerpt, emphasizing the importance of industrialization for the Soviet Union's defense and socialist construction.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (E).",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step reasoning for the answer:\n\n1. The passage states that Henry IV of France issued an edict in 1598 that restored and reestablished the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion in all places and localities of his kingdom and countries subject to his sway. This suggests that the exercise of this religion had been interrupted prior to 1598.\n2. The passage also states that Henry IV permitted those of the Reformed religion to live and abide in all the cities and places of his kingdom and countries of his sway, without being annoyed, molested, or compelled to do anything in the matter of religion contrary to their consciences. This suggests that there were religious differences and conflicts prior to 1598.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that prior to 1598, France was not free of religious conflict, and that there were differences and tensions between Catholics and Protestants.\n\nBased on these points, the correct answer is (D) prior to 1598, France was stricken with religious conflict.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",
