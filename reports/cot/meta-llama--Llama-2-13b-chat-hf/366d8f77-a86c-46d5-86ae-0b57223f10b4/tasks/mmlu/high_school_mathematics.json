Let's work through this problem step-by-step.\n\nSo, we have a pentagon P with vertices at (\u2013 2, \u2013 4), (\u20134, 1), (\u20131, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0). We want to reflect this pentagon across the line y = x to get a new pentagon, P'.\n\nFirst, let's think about what it means to reflect a shape across a line. When we reflect a shape across a line, we are essentially flipping the shape over the line, so that the left side becomes the right side and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, we want to reflect P across the line y = x. To do this, we need to find the point on the line y = x that is the same distance from the origin as the midpoint of the side of P that is closest to the line.\n\nCan you guess what point on the line y = x might be the midpoint of the side of P that is closest to the line?

Since the function is strictly convex, we know that the graph of $y = f(x)$ must be below the line segment joining $(-2, 5)$ and $(2, 9)$ for all $x$ values between $-2$ and $2$.\n2.

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed number (called the common difference) to the previous term. For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\nNow, let's think about the problem at hand. We want to find how many arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers sum to 240. An odd integer is a whole number that is not divisible by 2. Examples of odd integers include 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nTo start, let's consider the smallest possible value of the first term of the sequence: 1. The common difference of the sequence must be an odd integer, since all the terms in the sequence are odd. Let's assume that the common difference is 3.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many terms there are in the sequence. If we start with 1 and add the common difference 3 to each term, we get:\n\n1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ...\n\nSince we want the sum of the sequence to be 240, we know that the last term in the sequence must be 240. Therefore, the number of terms in the sequence is:\n\n240 - 1 = 239\n\nNow, let's count the number of arithmetic sequences of consecutive odd integers that have 239 terms:\n\nThere is only one such sequence, since we only have one choice for the common difference (3), and one choice for the first term (1).
