            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (B) \"Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe.\" \n\nReasoning: \nThe statement is sarcastic because it is exaggerating the amount of wobbling that the bike's wheel is doing. The use of the word \"several feet\" is an exaggeration and is meant to be humorous or ironic. The statement is implying that the bike's wheel is not wobbling enough to be considered unsafe, which is the opposite of what a person would expect a sarcastic statement to imply.",
