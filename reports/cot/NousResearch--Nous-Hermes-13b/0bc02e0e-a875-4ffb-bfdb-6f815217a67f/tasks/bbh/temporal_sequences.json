We know that she was seen at the yoga studio from 12pm to 1pm, and the Statue of Liberty is located in New York City, which is where the art studio is. Therefore, Elizabeth must have gone to the art studio after 1pm.\n\nNext, we need to consider the time when the art studio was closed. We know that the art studio was closed after 5pm. Since Elizabeth was seen at the yoga studio from 12pm to 1pm, she must have left the yoga studio and gone to the art studio between 1pm and 5pm.\n\nNow, we need to eliminate the options that do not fit within this time frame. Option (A) 9am to 12pm is eliminated because it falls before Elizabeth woke up at 6am. Option (D) 12pm to 1pm is eliminated because it falls after Elizabeth left the yoga studio at 1pm.\n\nThis leaves us with two options: (B) 8am to 9am and (C) 6am to 8am. Option (B) 8am to 9am is eliminated because it falls before Elizabeth woke up at 6am.
