            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "The paragraph describes a golf tournament where five golfers participated. Ada finished above Mel, which means she came in a higher position than Mel. Mel finished above Dan, which means he came in a higher position than Dan. Joe finished below Dan, which means he came in a lower position than Dan. Ada finished second, which means she came in a higher position than everyone except Rob. \nBased on this information, we can deduce that Rob finished first, Ada finished second, and Dan, Joe, and Mel finished in an order that is not specified. Therefore, options (A) Rob finished last, (B) Ada finished last, (C) Dan finished last, (D) Joe finished last, and (E) Mel finished last are all possible.",
