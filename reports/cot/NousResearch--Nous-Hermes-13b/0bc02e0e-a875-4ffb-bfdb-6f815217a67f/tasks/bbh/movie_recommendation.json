For example, (A) Nothing to Declare is a comedy that does not have any supernatural or fantasy elements, and (D) Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope is a sci-fi adventure that does not have the same themes as the other movies.\n\nThis leaves us with (B) Crossfire and (C) End of Days as potential options.
