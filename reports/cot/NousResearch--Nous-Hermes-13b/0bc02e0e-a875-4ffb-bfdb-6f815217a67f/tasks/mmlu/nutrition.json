            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (C) Approximately 50 %.\n\nReasoning:\nBariatric surgery is used for obesity treatment, but the incidence of type 2 diabetes reduction in obese individuals after surgery is not a straightforward answer. The effectiveness of bariatric surgery in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes varies depending on several factors such as the type of surgery, the patient's age, weight, and overall health.\n\nAccording to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), bariatric surgery can reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by up to 80% in obese individuals. However, this result is not consistent across all studies, and some studies have shown a reduction of only 50%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Approximately 50 %.",

            "question": "The amount and composition of dietary fat are important factors for influencing blood lipid metabolism. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement is (A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. \n\nExplanation: \nReplacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body, which can help to reduce the production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. VLDL particles are responsible for transporting triglycerides from the liver to other tissues in the body. By reducing the production of VLDL particles, the amount of triglycerides in the bloodstream is also reduced. \n\nOn the other hand, replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. This is because monounsaturated fatty acids can increase the production of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are responsible for transporting cholesterol in the bloodstream. \n\nConsumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. This is because these substances can reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines, leading to an increase in LDL cholesterol levels. \n\nFinally, replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because carbohydrates can increase the production of insulin, which can stimulate the production of VLDL particles and increase triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. Additionally, carbohydrates can also increase the production of glucose, which can be converted into fatty acids and stored as triglycerides in the liver.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement is (D) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small. \n\nReasoning: \n\nVitamin C is highly sensitive to heat and oxygen, which are both present in canned foods. When food is canned, it is heated to a high temperature to kill bacteria and other microorganisms, and then sealed in an airtight container. This process can cause significant losses of vitamin C, as it is easily destroyed by heat and oxidized by oxygen. \n\nHowever, the statement (A) is incorrect because it suggests that keeping the oxygen level high can limit losses of vitamin C. While it is true that oxygen can cause oxidation and loss of vitamin C, the main factor affecting vitamin C content in canned foods is the temperature at which the food is heated and the duration of heating. \n\nStatement (B) is also incorrect because reheating canned vegetables before serving can cause some losses of vitamin C, although they are generally small compared to the losses that occur during the canning process. \n\nStatement (C) is incorrect because it suggests that losses of vitamin C are higher for canned fruits than for canned vegetables. While it is true that some fruits, such as tomatoes, have higher natural levels of vitamin C than other fruits, the overall losses of vitamin C during canning are generally higher for most canned fruits than for canned vegetables. \n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (D) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small.",

While all amino acids are essential for proper body function, some can be synthesized in the body and are therefore considered dispensable. \n\nHowever, when the body is under stress, it may require more of these dispensable amino acids than can be synthesized in the body. This is because the body's focus is on repairing damaged tissues and providing energy, and it may prioritize the synthesis of non-dispensable amino acids that are essential for these processes. \n\nTherefore, under conditions of metabolic or other stress, the body may require more alanine than can be synthesized in the body.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon.\n\nReasoning:\n\nWater absorption in the GI tract primarily occurs in the large intestine (colon). The small intestine absorbs some water, but the majority of water absorption takes place in the colon. This is because the colon is lined with epithelial cells that have numerous microvilli, which increase the surface area for absorption. Additionally, the colon contains a large number of blood vessels that help transport absorbed water and electrolytes back into the bloodstream.\n\nGlucose, fructose, and galactose are all absorbed in the small intestine. They are transported into the bloodstream via different transporters, but they are not associated with sodium uptake. Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose, but this does not affect the absorption of glucose. Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane, but this does not affect the absorption of other sugars.\n\nTherefore, the most correct statement about absorption from the GI tract is that most water absorption occurs in the colon.",
