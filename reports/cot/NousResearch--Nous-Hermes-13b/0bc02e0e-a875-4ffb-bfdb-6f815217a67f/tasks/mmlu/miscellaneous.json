            "question": "Approximately how many movies are watched in homes in the United States in one year?\n\n(A) 200,000,000\n(B) 2,000,000,000\n(C) 20,000,000,000\n(D) 200,000,000,000",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the number of households in the United States and the average number of movies watched per household per year. According to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 126 million households in the United States in 2019. \n\nAssuming that each household watches an average of 10 movies in theaters per year, we can estimate that approximately 1.26 billion tickets are sold annually in the United States. However, this number does not account for the number of movies watched in homes. \n\nTo estimate the number of movies watched in homes, we can use data from the Motion Picture Association of America, which reports that in 2019, approximately 2.7 billion movies were watched in homes in the United States. \n\nBased on these estimates, we can calculate that the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year is approximately:\n\n(2.7 billion movies watched in homes) / (126 million households) = 21.39 movies per household per year\n\nSince the average household watches 10 movies in theaters per year, we can assume that they watch 10 - 21.39 = -11.39 movies in homes per year. However, this result is not realistic, as it implies that households watch fewer movies at home than in theaters. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year is likely to be significantly higher than the number of movies watched in theaters.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is likely to be (B) 2,000,000,000 or higher.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. How much ice is thrown out each year by Americans?\n2. What is the energy content of the ice?\n3. How much energy is wasted by throwing out the ice?\n\nLet's assume that on average, each American throws out 1 kg of ice per day. This means that in a year, an American would throw out 365 kg of ice.\n\nNow, let's assume that the ice is made of water. The energy content of water is 334 J/kg (this is the energy required to heat 1 kg of water by 1 degree Celsius).\n\nSo, the energy wasted by throwing out 1 kg of ice is 334 J.\n\nTherefore, the total energy wasted by throwing out 365 kg of ice in a year is:\n\n365 kg * 334 J/kg = 123,330 J\n\nNow, we need to convert this energy into the appropriate units. \n\n1 Joule is equal to 0.239006 calories. So, 123,330 J is equal to:\n\n123,330 J * 0.239006 cal/J = 29,667.67 calories\n\nNow, we need to convert calories into BTUs (British Thermal Units). 1 calorie is equal to 0.001055 BTUs. So, 29,667.67 calories is equal to:\n\n29,667.67 cal * 0.001055 BTU/cal = 0.314 BTUs\n\nSo, the answer is (D) 6*10^17 J.",
