            "question": "A 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination. The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits Interleukin-1 (IL-1). \n\nExplanation: \nAnkylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine. It is characterized by chronic inflammation and pain in the joints, particularly in the spine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sulfasalazine are commonly used to manage the pain and inflammation associated with the condition. However, if these treatments are ineffective, the next step would be to target the underlying cause of the inflammation, which is the overproduction of certain inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). \n\nIL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory process. By inhibiting the production or activity of IL-1, we can effectively reduce inflammation and alleviate pain and other symptoms associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment would be to administer a drug that inhibits IL-1, such as an IL-1 inhibitor.",

Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (D) respondeat superior. \n\nExplanation: \nRespondeat superior is a legal doctrine that holds an employer liable for the torts committed by its employees while acting within the scope of their employment. In this case, the patient is alleging that the negligence of the healthcare provider (the employer) resulted in the injury caused by the surgical sponge (the tort). The fact that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence supports the argument that the healthcare provider was not diligent in their duties, which is a necessary element of a respondeat superior claim.",

By understanding the patient's diet, we can better determine if there are any specific foods or nutrients that may be contributing to her symptoms. Additionally, her height, weight, and BMI suggest that she may be underweight, which could also contribute to her constipation.

This suggests that she may be experiencing orthostatic hypotension, which can be a side effect of some medications, such as diuretics and \u03b2-blockers. \n\nThe patient has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently taking glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is possible that one or more of these medications may be contributing to her orthostatic hypotension. \n\nThe physician should consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to see if this improves her symptoms. This may involve reducing the dose of one or more medications, or switching to a different medication that may be less likely to cause orthostatic hypotension. \n\nCardiac stress scintigraphy, warfarin therapy, and transesophageal echocardiography are not necessarily inappropriate, but they are less likely to be the most appropriate next step in this particular situation.",

The patient is a 27-year-old man who has recently seen a psychiatrist for the first time and was prescribed a medication, but his sister is not sure what it is. This suggests that he may have been started on a neuroleptic medication, which is a common cause of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).\n\n2.
