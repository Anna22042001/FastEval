            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil. \n\nThe blood flow through the vessels is maintained because of the elasticity of the arteries. When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood through the aortic valve and into the aorta. As the blood flows through the arteries, the walls of the arteries expand and store some of the energy from the blood flow. When the left ventricle relaxes, the pressure in the aorta drops, causing the arteries to recoil and constrict slightly. This constriction helps to maintain blood flow to the rest of the body. The elastic recoil of the arteries is what allows blood to continue flowing through the vessels even after the left ventricle has finished contracting.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.\n\nReasoning:\nMuscle fibers contract when the nerve stimulus is received. This stimulus causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which then bind to troponin, causing a conformational change that allows myosin to bind to actin. This is the first step in muscle contraction.\n\nWhen the nerve stimulus is removed, the calcium ions are no longer released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the troponin returns to its original conformation, preventing myosin from binding to actin. This causes the muscle fibre to relax.\n\nTherefore, the nerve stimulus being removed is the primary factor that causes muscle fibers to relax.",

            "correct_answer": 2,

This demand is primarily met by the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through cellular respiration. If the rate of ATP production does not keep up with the rate of energy demand, the body experiences fatigue. Therefore, the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand is a fundamental cause of fatigue in high-intensity exercise.",

Acetylcholine is involved in the regulation of muscle activity and the maintenance of arousal, while noradrenaline is involved in the regulation of attention and alertness.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the time it takes for the body to resynthesize phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy phosphate stored in muscles and is used to regenerate ATP during intense exercise. After very high intensity exercise, phosphocreatine levels are depleted and need to be resynthesized.\n\nThe resynthesis of phosphocreatine is a complex process that involves several steps, including the transport of creatine into muscle cells, the conversion of creatine to phosphocreatine, and the regeneration of ATP. The rate-limiting step in this process is the transport of creatine into muscle cells, which is regulated by the availability of the creatine transporter.\n\nAfter very high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP is high, and the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis needs to be rapid to meet this demand. Studies have shown that the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis is rapid and can reach up to 80% of its initial value within 10 seconds after the cessation of exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) about 10 seconds.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and determine which one is true in spastic paraplegia.\n\n(A) Multiple Sclerosis can cause this neurological pattern:\nThis statement is false. Multiple Sclerosis is a demyelinating disease that affects the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, causing a wide range of neurological symptoms. However, it does not cause the specific neurological pattern seen in spastic paraplegia.\n\n(B) Proprioceptive loss is a common feature:\nThis statement is true. Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement. In spastic paraplegia, there is a loss of proprioception, which means that the individual has difficulty knowing where their body parts are in space and controlling their movements.\n\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected:\nThis statement is true. Coordination refers to the ability to move different body parts in a smooth and controlled manner. In spastic paraplegia, there is a problem with the coordination of leg movements, leading to a characteristic spastic gait.\n\n(D) The tone is normal or flaccid:\nThis statement is false. In spastic paraplegia, the tone in the legs is increased, which means that the muscles are constantly contracted and do not relax. This leads to stiffness and difficulty in moving the legs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Proprioceptive loss is a common feature.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) insulin. \n\nReasoning:\nGlycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is regulated by several hormones and factors. One of the primary hormones involved in this process is insulin. Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to elevated blood glucose levels, which occurs during exercise. Insulin promotes glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscles, and inhibits glycogen breakdown. This helps to maintain blood glucose levels and provide energy for the working muscles.\n\nCortisol, on the other hand, is a hormone released in response to stress and low blood glucose levels. It promotes glycogen breakdown in the liver to release glucose into the bloodstream. However, cortisol does not play a significant role in glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle.\n\nIncreased pH is also not a factor in glycogen breakdown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) insulin.",
