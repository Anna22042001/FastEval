            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Hospice. \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The program is designed to help people with 6 or fewer months to live.\n2. The goal is to keep them at home and provide pain relief.\n3. The program also ends all life-prolonging technologies, which means it is not euthanasia.\n4. Cryonics is a process of preserving a body in hopes of future revival, which is not related to the program's goals.\n5. Medicare is a government health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, which is not related to the program's goals.\n6. Hospice is a type of care that focuses on providing comfort and support to people with life-limiting illnesses, which aligns with the program's goals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Hospice.",

We are looking for the option that is most helpful to the bereaved individuals.\n3. Avoid any discussion of the deceased is not helpful because it would only cause more pain to the bereaved.\n4. Stay away and let the person grieve is not helpful because it would isolate the bereaved and make them feel more alone.\n5.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the possible reasons why older workers might be more likely to be laid off. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n1. Older workers may be more expensive to employ due to higher salaries and benefits.\n2. Older workers may be less adaptable to new technologies and work practices.\n3. Older workers may be less willing to relocate or work unusual hours.\n4. Older workers may be more likely to have health problems or disabilities that affect their ability to work.\n\nBased on these reasons, it is likely that older workers are more likely to be laid off because they are more expensive to employ, less adaptable to new technologies and work practices, less willing to relocate or work unusual hours, and more likely to have health problems or disabilities that affect their ability to work. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Be laid off.",

They often ask for opinions, interpretations, or personal experiences. These types of questions can be difficult to interpret because people may have different interpretations or may not express their thoughts clearly. This can make it challenging to understand the responses and interpret the data accurately. Therefore, open-ended questions make it difficult to interpret the answers you get from people.",

This generation had a large number of births after World War II, resulting in a significant increase in the number of people reaching retirement age.\n\nThe steadily increasing birth rate (B) is also a contributing factor to the increase in numbers of older adults. As the birth rate increases, there are more people born who will eventually reach old age.\n\nIncreases in life expectancy at a specified age (D) is not one of the major reasons for the increase in numbers of older adults. While it is true that life expectancy has been increasing, the primary reason for the increase in numbers of older adults is the increase in life expectancy at birth.
