            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of optical isomerism in complexes. Optical isomerism occurs when a complex has a non-superimposable mirror image, which means that the complex and its mirror image cannot be superimposed on each other. This is also known as chirality.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is incorrect because square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if the ligands are different. The key factor for optical isomerism in square planar complex is the arrangement of the ligands in space, not their identity.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is incorrect because tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if the arrangement of the ligands in space is such that they form a non-superimposable mirror image.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is incorrect because optical isomerism in linear complexes is determined by the arrangement of the ligands in space, not their identity.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is correct. In an octahedral complex, the arrangement of the ligands in space is crucial for optical isomerism. If the ligands are different and arranged in a way that they form a non-superimposable mirror image, the complex can display optical isomerism. Therefore, at least three different ligands are required for optical isomerism in octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to look at the atomic number of the element Mn, which is 25. The atomic number represents the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. Since Mn has 25 protons, it also has 25 electrons. \n\nNow, we need to determine the number of energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide. The energy levels of an atom are determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell. Mn has 12 electrons in its outermost shell, with 6 electrons in the 4s orbital and 6 electrons in the 4p orbital. \n\nWhen Mn undergoes beta decay to form 55Mn, it loses an electron from the 4p orbital. This means that the 55Mn nuclide will have 11 electrons in its outermost shell, with 5 electrons in the 4s orbital and 6 electrons in the 4p orbital. \n\nThe number of energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide is determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell. Since there are 5 electrons in the 4s orbital and 6 electrons in the 4p orbital, there are a total of 5 + 6 = 11 energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 3.",
