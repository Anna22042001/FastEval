            "model_answer": "To determine the most appropriate statement, we need to look at the given information and the context of the question. The director of the food bank wants data on all donations given during the month of November, so we need to find the information that will help us answer that specific question.\n\nThe average donation is given as $155, and the standard deviation is given as $32. This means that the donations are not very spread out, as the standard deviation is relatively low compared to the average donation.\n\nNow, let's look at the given options:\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155. - This statement is true based on the given information, but it doesn't provide any additional context or insight into the donations received during the month of November.\n\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155. - This statement is not true based on the given information. The standard deviation of $32 indicates that the donations are not very spread out, which means that only a small percentage of donations would be more than $155.\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219. - This statement is not true based on the given information. The standard deviation of $32 indicates that the donations are not very spread out, which means that the 95% confidence interval would be much narrower than the range given in the statement.\n\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161. - This statement is true based on the given information. The standard deviation of $32 indicates that the donations are not very spread out, which means that the 95% confidence interval would be within the range of $149 to $161.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement is (D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.",

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible.

            "model_answer": "The teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations. \n\nHere's the reasoning: \nThe median is the middle value of a set of numbers when they are arranged in order. In this case, the teachers' union would want to know what the average salary is for all the teachers, including both those who are paid moderately and those who are highly paid administrators. The mean, on the other hand, is the sum of all the salaries divided by the number of teachers. This means that the mean can be skewed by the high salaries of the administrators, making it an unreliable measure of the typical teacher's salary. \n\nThe mode is the most common value in a set of numbers, but it is not very useful in this context because it only tells us which salary is most common, not the typical salary. \n\nThe standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the salaries are from the mean, but it is also not very useful in this context because it does not tell us the typical salary. \n\nTherefore, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries, which gives a better indication of the typical salary for all teachers.",

In order to use a \u03c72 test, the expected values in each cell of a table must be at least 5.
