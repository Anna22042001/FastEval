            "model_answer": "The most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue would depend on the specific issue and the target audience. However, research has shown that interpersonal communication can be the most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue. This is because interpersonal communication allows for a more personal and direct exchange of information and ideas, which can lead to a deeper understanding and acceptance of the issue. Additionally, interpersonal communication can facilitate the building of trust and rapport, which can be important in persuading someone to change their predisposition toward an issue.",

Objectives are decided on at the stage of evaluating the program. This is because the objectives are the goals or desired outcomes that the program is intended to achieve. They are established before the program is implemented, and are used to guide the planning and implementation process. Once the program is implemented, the objectives are evaluated to determine whether they were achieved or not. If they were not achieved, the objectives may be revised and the program may be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, the stage of evaluating the program is when the objectives are decided on.",
