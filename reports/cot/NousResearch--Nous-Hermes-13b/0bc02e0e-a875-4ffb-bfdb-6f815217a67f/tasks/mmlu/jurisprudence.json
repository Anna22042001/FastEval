Which proposition below is most inconsistent with this claim?\n\n(A) In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\n(B) The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\n(C) Judges exercise strong discretion.\n(D) Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.",

            "model_answer": "The proposition that is most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim is (C) Judges exercise strong discretion. This is because Dworkin believes that there is only one right answer to every legal question, and therefore judges should not have the discretion to make decisions based on their personal preferences or beliefs. Instead, they should base their decisions on the legal principles and precedents that have been established.",

The idea that there are certain moral and legal principles that are inherent in human nature and that govern human behavior can be traced back to these ancient Greek thinkers. \n\nThe American War of Independence and the French Revolution were both influenced by the idea of natural law, but the concept itself predates these events. Roman Law also has its own legal principles, but the idea of natural law as a universal moral code is not found in Roman legal thought.",

It is a hypothetical person who exercises the level of care that a reasonable person would in similar circumstances. \n\nStatement (B) is incorrect because the reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's objective behavior rather than on the defendant's subjective mental state. \n\nStatement (C) is incorrect because a person with a physical disability is not held to a different standard than a person without a disability. Instead, the standard is adjusted based on the specific limitations of the individual. \n\nStatement (D) is incorrect because a person with a mental disability is not held to a different standard than a person without a disability.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Effectiveness of rehabilitation of multiplied by hazard to the community.\n\nReasoning:\nThe formula r x H is a guide to determine the appropriate punishment. The first letter 'r' stands for 'extent of responsibility'. This means that the punishment should be based on the degree to which the offender is responsible for the crime. The second letter 'x' stands for 'multiplied by'. This means that the extent of responsibility should be multiplied by something else to get the final punishment. The third letter 'H' stands for 'hazard to the community'. This means that the punishment should also take into account the danger that the offender poses to the community. Therefore, the formula r x H means that the extent of responsibility should be multiplied by the hazard to the community to determine the appropriate punishment.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) The principles of natural law are discoverable by reason. \n\nReason is a key element because Cicero believed that the principles of natural law are discoverable by reason. This means that humans can use their rational faculties to discern the natural law and apply it in their lives. This is in contrast to other views that might suggest that natural law is based on divine revelation or is inherent in human nature.

'Law as medium' refers to the formal, general rules that control the state and the economy, such as legal codes and statutes. These rules are objective and impersonal, and they are designed to regulate social behavior in a neutral and impartial manner.\n\nOn the other hand, 'law as institution' refers to the informal, shared values and norms that are expressed in institutional form in the 'lifeworld'. The 'lifeworld' is the realm of personal relationships, social interactions, and cultural practices that are not subject to formal legal regulation. Law as institution is based on the shared values and norms of a particular community or society, and it is often expressed in informal ways, such as through customs, traditions, and social norms.\n\nTherefore, statement (A) accurately describes Habermas' distinction between 'law as medium' and 'law as institution' by explaining that law as medium refers to formal, general rules that control the state and the economy, while law as institution refers to the informal, shared values and norms that are expressed in institutional form in the 'lifeworld'.",

Therefore, the proposition that law is politics would be rejected by those who believe that law is not simply a reflection of political power, but rather an active player in shaping it.",

Sociological jurisprudence - this school believes that the law is an aggregate of social traditions and customs that have developed over the centuries. \n\nOut of these four schools, only the fourth one, Sociological jurisprudence, believes that the law is an aggregate of social traditions and customs that have developed over the centuries.
