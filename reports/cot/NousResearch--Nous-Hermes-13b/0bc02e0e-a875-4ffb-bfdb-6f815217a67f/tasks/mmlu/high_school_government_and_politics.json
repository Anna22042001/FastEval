            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n\nReasoning:\n\nAppellate courts are higher courts that review decisions of lower courts. They do not usually decide the facts of a case, as that is the job of the trial court. Appellate trials are not usually jury trials, as they involve a review of a case that has already been decided by a lower court. Finally, appellate judges do use the stare decisis principle, which means they follow precedents set by higher courts in similar cases.",

This means that the president has the authority to select the staff for different departments and agencies within the executive branch. \n\nThe Peace Corps is an independent agency, so it is not part of the executive branch and therefore not affected by these orders. \n\nThe White House Office and the Senate Committee on Appropriations are part of the legislative branch, so the president does not have the authority to select their staff. \n\nTherefore, the only option left is (D) Cabinet, which is part of the executive branch and falls under the authority of these orders.",

This decision was widely criticized and helped to fuel tensions that led to the Civil War. \n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1868, was a key part of the Reconstruction era and was designed to address some of the issues raised by the Dred Scott decision. Specifically, the amendment states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" This language was intended to overturn the Dred Scott decision and ensure that African Americans were considered citizens with full rights. \n\nTherefore, the Fourteenth Amendment was the decision that overturned the Dred Scott decision.",

This could be because their friends or colleagues belong to a different political party and they feel the need to align themselves with that group in order to fit in. \n\nSecondly, economic issues could also play a role in a person's decision to join a different political party. For example, if a person's parents belong to a party that they feel is not addressing their economic concerns, they might join a different party that they believe will better represent their interests.\n\nThirdly, religious beliefs could also be a factor in a person's decision to join a different political party. If a person's parents belong to a party that does not align with their religious beliefs, they might join a party that they feel better represents their religious values.\n\nFinally, pressure from their employers could also be a reason why a person might join a different political party. If a person's parents belong to a party that their employer does not support, they might feel pressure to join a different party in order to maintain their employment.\n\nBased on these reasons, the answer to the question is (D) pressure from their employers.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor.\n\nReasoning:\n\nCommittee assignments are important for members of Congress because they determine the power and influence they have within their respective chambers. \n\nHouse members are more concerned about their committee assignments than are senators because the rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor. This is because the House operates under a system of \"committee jurisdiction,\" which means that bills must be referred to the appropriate committee before they can be considered on the House floor. This means that representatives must first gain the support of their committee chair and ranking member before they can even bring a bill to a vote on the House floor. This makes it more difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor compared to senators, who do not have the same committee jurisdiction system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) the rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor.",
