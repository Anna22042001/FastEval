In this book, they argue that the economy has shifted from a \"goods economy\" to a \"service economy\" and now to an \"experience economy\", where the focus is on providing unique and memorable experiences to customers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Experience economy.",

Option (B) is also correct as it states that corporations have a broader constituency of stakeholders than shareholders alone.
