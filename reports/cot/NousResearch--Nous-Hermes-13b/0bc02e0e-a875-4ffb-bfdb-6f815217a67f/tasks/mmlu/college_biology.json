They provide several benefits to the plants, including enhanced nutrient uptake, increased water absorption, and protection from pathogens.\n\nOut of the given options, (A) They protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats and (D) They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen are not benefits conferred by mycorrhizal fungi.\n\n(C) They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils is also not a benefit conferred by mycorrhizal fungi. While mycorrhizal fungi can help plants access phosphorus, it is not a unique benefit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement concerning the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote is (B) It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. \n\nReasoning: \nThe Golgi apparatus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells that is responsible for processing, modifying, and sorting proteins and lipids that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is composed of a series of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. \n\nStatement (A) is incorrect because the cis face of the Golgi apparatus is not closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, it is the trans face that is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. \n\nStatement (C) is incorrect because the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are not continuous with one another. Instead, they are separated by cis-Golgi networks, which are composed of specific proteins and lipids that help in the sorting and transport of vesicles between the cisternae. \n\nStatement (D) is incorrect because glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs after the protein's entry into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) reversibly decreasing the number of enzyme molecules that are available to bind substrates.\n\nExplanation:\nA competitive inhibitor is a molecule that competes with the substrate for binding to the enzyme's active site. It does not form covalent links with the enzyme or modify its amino acid residues. Instead, it binds to the enzyme and prevents it from binding to the substrate. This effectively decreases the number of enzyme molecules available to bind substrates, thus reducing the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This effect is reversible, as the inhibitor can be displaced by the substrate, allowing the enzyme to resume its activity.",

They work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. \n\nBacterial cells have several unique features that make them different from other types of cells, such as eukaryotic cells. One of these features is the presence of peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Peptidoglycan is a complex polymer that provides structural support and protection to the bacterial cell. \n\nAntibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with the synthesis of peptidoglycan. This means that these antibiotics are effective against bacteria, but they do not affect other types of cells, such as eukaryotic cells, which do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) peptidoglycan synthesis.",
