            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "NGS is most often used for (B) to search for drug resistant mutants. \n\nReasoning: NGS is a powerful tool that allows for rapid and high-throughput sequencing of DNA or RNA. It is often used in the field of genomics and molecular biology to study the genetic makeup of organisms, including the identification of mutations and variations. \n\nOne of the primary uses of NGS is to identify drug resistant mutants. This is because NGS allows for the rapid and accurate sequencing of large amounts of DNA or RNA, which can then be compared to a reference genome or transcriptome to identify mutations that may be associated with drug resistance. This information can be used to develop new treatments and strategies to combat drug-resistant infections.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) to search for drug resistant mutants.",

In a clinical trial, the goal is to compare the effect of a treatment to a control group.\n2. To ensure that any differences observed between the two groups are due to the treatment and not other factors, it is essential to control for these factors.\n3. (A) Placebo effect: Randomization helps to control for the placebo effect by ensuring that both groups have an equal chance of receiving a placebo or an active treatment.\n4. (B) Recall bias: Randomization helps to control for recall bias by ensuring that both groups have an equal chance of being asked about their symptoms or past medical history.\n5. (C) Non-compliance: Randomization helps to control for non-compliance by ensuring that both groups have an equal chance of following the treatment protocol.\n6. (D) Effect modification (interaction): Randomization helps to control for effect modification by ensuring that both groups have an equal chance of being affected by any external factors that may interact with the treatment.\n\nTherefore, randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for effect modification (interaction).",

He used a killed vaccine made from the air-dried spinal cord of infected rabbits. This vaccine required multiple doses to be given into the peritoneal cavity of the patient. \n\nThe modern rabies vaccine, on the other hand, is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo. This is a significant departure from the original vaccine, as it is no longer a killed vaccine and does not require multiple doses to be given into the peritoneal cavity. \n\nTherefore, the special feature of the rabies vaccine is that it is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo.",

This is achieved through the activation of B and T cells, which are part of the immune system's defense against infections.\n\nOne of the key features of adaptive immunity is its ability to distinguish between self and non-self. This means that the immune system can tell the difference between the body's own proteins and those of foreign invaders, such as bacteria or viruses. This is important because it allows the immune system to target and eliminate pathogens without attacking the body's own cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non self.",

However, vaccines are a more effective way to prevent disease as they help the body develop immunity against specific viruses or bacteria. Vaccines are designed to protect against many infectious diseases, including measles, polio, hepatitis, and influenza. Antivirals are medications that can be used to treat viral infections, but they do not prevent the infection from occurring. Mosquito nets are effective in preventing mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, but they do not prevent other types of diseases.
