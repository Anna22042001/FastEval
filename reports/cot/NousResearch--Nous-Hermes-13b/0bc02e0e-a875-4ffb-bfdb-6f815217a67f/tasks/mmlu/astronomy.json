How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) You will see two distinct stars.\n\nReasoning:\nIf the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes, it means that we cannot see them as two separate stars. Our eyes have a limit to how close two objects can be before we perceive them as a single object. This limit is called the angular resolution of our eyes. \n\nSo, if the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes, we will not be able to see these two stars as two distinct objects. Instead, we will see them as a single point of light. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) You will see two distinct stars.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\n\nReasoning:\nThe magnetic field of a planet is generated by the motion of charged particles in its core. This motion is caused by the planet's rotation and the presence of a molten metallic core. \n\nOut of the terrestrial worlds, Earth has the strongest magnetic field. This is because it is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation. \n\nThe other options mentioned - (A) It is by far the largest terrestrial world, (B) It is the most volcanically active world, and (D) It rotates much faster than any other terrestrial world - do not contribute to the generation of a magnetic field.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) significant \"shear\" between bands of circulation at different latitudes. \n\nReasoning: \nSaturn and Jupiter's atmospheres are both composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of other gases. Both planets have belts and zones, as well as storms. However, the difference between the two atmospheres lies in the \"shear\" or the difference in wind speed and direction between bands of circulation at different latitudes. While both planets have this phenomenon, it is more pronounced in Jupiter's atmosphere, with wind speeds reaching up to 400 miles per hour at the equator and slowing down towards the poles. This difference in wind speed and direction between bands of circulation at different latitudes is what sets Jupiter's atmosphere apart from Saturn's.",

            "question": "Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?\n\n(A) In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\n(B) In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\n(C) Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\n(D) When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions. \n\nExplanation: \nThe formation of the solar system began with the collapse of a giant molecular cloud, which formed a rotating disk-like structure called the protoplanetary disk. The inner planets, also known as the terrestrial planets, are made up of denser materials such as metals and rocks, while the outer planets, also known as the gas giants, are made up of lighter materials such as hydrogen and helium. \n\nThe reason for this difference in composition is due to the temperature and pressure conditions in the early solar system. In the inner part of the nebula, where the temperatures were much higher, only metals and rocks were able to condense and form solid bodies. On the other hand, in the cooler outer regions, hydrogen compounds were able to condense and form gas giants. \n\nTherefore, the answer (B) is the correct explanation for the difference in composition between the inner and outer planets.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) To explain why more distant planets take longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac. \n\nReasoning: \nPtolemy's model of the universe, known as the Ptolemaic system, was based on the idea that the Earth was at the center of the universe, with all celestial bodies, including the planets, orbiting around it. In this model, the planets were believed to orbit on 'circles upon circles', which meant that they were moving on multiple, nested spheres. \n\nThe reason for this was to explain why more distant planets take longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac. This is because the outermost sphere, which contains the planet Saturn, moves more slowly than the inner spheres, which contain the other planets. This means that the planets farther from the Earth take longer to complete their orbits and appear to move more slowly relative to the stars in our sky. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) To explain why more distant planets take longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac.",

This range was determined through scientific experiments and observations. The lower limit of 380 nm was chosen because it corresponds to the wavelength of the shortest visible light that the human eye can detect, which is the blue light. The upper limit of 740 nm was chosen because it corresponds to the wavelength of the longest visible light that the human eye can detect, which is the red light.\n\nTherefore, the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum is between 380 and 740 nm.",
