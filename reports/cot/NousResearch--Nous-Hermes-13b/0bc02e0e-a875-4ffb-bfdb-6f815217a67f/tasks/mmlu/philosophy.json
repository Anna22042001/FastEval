            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the two concepts mentioned by Cicero: immorality and expediency. \n\nFirst, let's define what we mean by \"immorality\" and \"expediency.\" Immorality refers to actions that are considered wrong or unjust, while expediency refers to actions that are considered practical or advantageous, even if they may not be strictly moral. \n\nNow, let's analyze the four possible combinations of these two concepts:\n\n1. Immorality is repugnant to Nature, and expediency is repugnant to Nature.\nThis statement suggests that both immorality and expediency are against the natural order of things. However, Cicero's view on morality and expediency may differ from this statement.\n\n2. Immorality is repugnant to Nature, and expediency is in accord with Nature.\nThis statement suggests that immorality is against the natural order of things, but expediency is in line with it. This is closer to Cicero's view on morality and expediency, as he believed that moral actions should also be practical and advantageous.\n\n3. Immorality is in accord with Nature, and expediency is repugnant to Nature.\nThis statement suggests that immorality is in line with the natural order of things, but expediency is against it. This is the opposite of Cicero's view on morality and expediency.\n\n4. Immorality is in accord with Nature, and expediency is in accord with Nature.\nThis statement suggests that both immorality and expediency are in line with the natural order of things. However, this option is not relevant to Cicero's view on morality and expediency, as he believed that moral actions should also be practical and advantageous.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is (B) repugnant to Nature; in accord with Nature. This option is closest to Cicero's view on morality and expediency, as he believed that moral actions should also be practical and advantageous.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the supreme principle of morality according to Kant, we need to examine his philosophy and identify the principle that best aligns with his beliefs. Kant's philosophy is based on the idea that there is a categorical imperative, which is an unconditional moral principle that applies to all rational beings. This principle is not based on any external factors or consequences, but rather on the inherent nature of morality itself.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) synthetic and a priori.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the character of the virtuous man described by Epictetus. We can assume that this man values virtues such as self-control, wisdom, and courage. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would feel righteous indignation or envy towards others. \n\nModerate grief is a possible option, as it is a natural emotion that a virtuous person may experience in response to the loss of loved ones. However, Epictetus also emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's composure and not allowing emotions to overwhelm one's rational judgment. Therefore, it is possible that a virtuous man may feel undisturbed, as he would strive to maintain his equanimity in the face of adversity.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most likely answer is (B) moderate grief.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) a state of tranquility. \n\nReasoning: \nHobbes' view of human life is that it is \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\" (a quote from his book Leviathan). In this context, felicity refers to a state of happiness or contentment. \n\nHobbes believes that the only way to achieve felicity is through a life of contemplation, which means being in a state of calm and peaceful reflection. This is because, according to Hobbes, the natural state of humans is one of constant desire and struggle for survival. Therefore, a state of tranquility is necessary to achieve felicity.\n\nOption (B) describes a continual progress of desire from one object to another, which is the opposite of contemplation and tranquility. Option (C) describes a state of contemplation, which is correct, but it does not directly relate to felicity. Option (D) describes the absence of desire, which is also the opposite of contemplation and tranquility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) a state of tranquility.",

This means that he cannot be certain about anything, including the existence of the evil demon itself.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\nDescartes concludes that if he is unsure about the existence of the evil demon, then it is possible that it does not exist.
