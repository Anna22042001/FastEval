            "model_answer": "The successor auditor would ask the predecessor auditor to provide (D) Matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years. \n\nReasoning: \nThe successor auditor needs to understand the financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years to perform their audit effectively. This includes understanding the accounting policies and principles used by the predecessor auditor, as well as any significant changes that may have occurred. Therefore, (A) Disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management as to significant accounting policies and principles is not the correct answer. \n\nSimilarly, (B) The predecessor auditor\u2019s understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors is not relevant to the successor auditor's engagement. \n\n(C) Facts known to the predecessor auditor that might bear on the integrity of management is also not the correct answer, as the successor auditor is primarily concerned with financial reporting consistency. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of Swift's segments are required to be separately disclosed in its December 31 year 2 financial statements, we need to follow the guidance provided by ASC 280, Segment Reporting. According to ASC 280, a reportable segment is a component of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\n\nStep 1: Identify the reportable segments\nWe need to identify the segments for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the CODM. In this case, we have the following information:\n\n- Segment A: Reported revenue of $42 thousand, reported profit/(loss) of $12 thousand, and assets of $470 thousand.\n- Segment B: Reported revenue of $121 thousand, reported profit/(loss) of $65 thousand, and assets of $800 thousand.\n- Segment C: Reported revenue of $14 thousand, reported profit/(loss) of $(3) thousand, and assets of $80 thousand.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the segments meet the criteria for reportable segments\nTo determine if the segments meet the criteria for reportable segments, we need to evaluate if they meet the following criteria:\n\n- Segment A: The revenue is significant ($42 thousand) and the assets are also significant ($470 thousand). The profit/(loss) is not significant as it is only $12 thousand.\n- Segment B: The revenue is significant ($121 thousand) and the assets are also significant ($800 thousand). The profit/(loss) is also significant as it is $65 thousand.\n- Segment C: The revenue is not significant ($14 thousand) and the assets are not significant ($80 thousand). The profit/(loss) is not significant as it is $(3) thousand.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the segments are required to be separately disclosed\nBased on the evaluation of the segments, we can determine that:\n\n- Segment A and B meet the criteria for reportable segments as they have significant revenue and assets.\n- Segment C does not meet the criteria for a reportable segment as it does not have significant revenue or assets.\n\nTherefore, the segments that are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements are A and B.",

A CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures are designed to ensure the firm's auditing practice meets certain standards of quality.\n2. One of the key elements of an audit is professional skepticism, which means the auditor should be skeptical of management's representations and assumptions, and should verify them through testing and other procedures.\n3. Therefore, professional skepticism of management is an essential element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice.\n4. None of the other options (acceptance of a client relationship, computer information processing, or efficiency of organizational structures) are directly related to the firm's auditing practice or quality control policies and procedures.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe right of shareholders to inspect corporate books and records is a fundamental right granted to shareholders under most state corporation laws. This right is designed to allow shareholders to monitor the affairs of the corporation and to ensure that the corporation is being run in a proper manner.\n\nHowever, this right is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations. One of these limitations is that the demand to inspect must be for a proper purpose. This means that the shareholder must have a valid and reasonable basis for requesting access to the corporate books and records. The purpose of the inspection must be to inform the shareholder's decision-making process as a shareholder, such as to determine whether to vote for or against a proposal, or to evaluate the performance of management.\n\nIn contrast, a demand to inspect that is made for an improper purpose, such as to harass or embarrass management, or to pursue a personal vendetta, is not permitted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.",
