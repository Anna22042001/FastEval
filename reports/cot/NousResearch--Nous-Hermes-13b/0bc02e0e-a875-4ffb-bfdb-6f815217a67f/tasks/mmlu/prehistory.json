            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) prognathous.\n\nReasoning:\n\nPrognathous means \"projecting forward\" or \"having a forward-thrusting lower face.\" This description fits the characteristics of an animal or person with a strong jaw that protrudes forward.\n\nA arboreal means \"living or situated in trees\" and is not relevant to this question.\n\nD diastema means \"a gap between the front teeth\" and is not relevant to this question.\n\nMandible means \"the lower jaw\" and is not relevant to this question.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) producing core tools to producing flakes.\n\nReasoning:\nLevallois technology is a method of knapping flint or other stones to make stone tools, typically by working around the edges of a core stone with a hammerstone to create flakes. This method is more advanced than earlier methods of stone tool production, which focused on producing core tools. Therefore, the shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes is the most logical answer.",

Maize is a domesticated crop that has been selectively bred over thousands of years from the wild teosinte species.
