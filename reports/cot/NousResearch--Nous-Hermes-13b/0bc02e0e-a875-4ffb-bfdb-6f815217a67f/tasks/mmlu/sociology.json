We are not given any information about the relationship between depression and social support. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A).\n\nOption (B) states that self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. We are not given any information about the relationship between depression and affluence. Therefore, we can eliminate option (B).\n\nOption (C) states that men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. We are not given any information about the relationship between depression and gender. Therefore, we can eliminate option (C).\n\nOption (D) states that men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. We are not given any information about the relationship between depression and gender roles. Therefore, we can eliminate option (D).\n\nBased on the information given, we can conclude that the answer is (A).",

This means that people who were once working class and earning a wage are now becoming more affluent and adopting the values and lifestyles associated with the middle class. This can include things like owning a home, having a stable job, and participating in leisure activities that are typically associated with the middle class. This process is known as embourgeoisement, which is a French word that means \"becoming bourgeois.\" The bourgeoisie refers to the middle class, so embourgeoisement is essentially the process of becoming middle class.",

If drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture, it means that the use of drugs has become more widespread and is not limited to a specific group of people. \n\nOption (B) states that the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy. However, this information is not related to the given patterns of drug use in Britain. \n\nFinally, we can analyze option (C).

This is because when men are unemployed or both partners work full time, there is a greater need for housework to be done, and men may feel more pressure to take on these tasks. Additionally, when both partners work full time, there may be less time for housework to be done, and men may feel the need to compensate by taking on more housework.",

This means that the class situation of an individual is determined by their economic resources, such as their wealth, income, and property. This definition is different from the other options, which focus on different aspects of social class, such as exploitation, consciousness, lifestyle, and market position.

This can be problematic because it may deceive the respondents as to the reason for your presence. They may not be aware that they are being observed and may act differently than they normally would. This can lead to inaccurate or unreliable data. \n\nOption (A) not being able to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations is not a direct consequence of covert participant observation. It may be a challenge, but it is not an ethical problem. \n\nOption (C) observing people outside of their natural setting is also not an ethical problem.
