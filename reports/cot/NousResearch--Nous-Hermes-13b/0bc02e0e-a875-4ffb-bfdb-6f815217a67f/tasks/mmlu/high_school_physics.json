            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the motion of the ball and the forces acting on it. \n\nFirst, let's consider the initial conditions. The ball is tossed straight up with an initial speed of 0 m/s. This means that the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which is acting downwards. \n\nAs the ball rises, gravity causes it to accelerate downwards. The acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. \n\nAt the highest point, the ball's speed will be 0 m/s (since it is momentarily stationary). However, the ball will still be experiencing an upward force due to gravity, which will cause it to start falling back down. \n\nAs the ball falls back down, gravity continues to act on it, causing it to accelerate downwards. \n\nNow, let's consider the statements:\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is true. As we mentioned earlier, the ball's speed will be 0 m/s at the highest point.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is false. As we mentioned earlier, the ball will be experiencing an upward force due to gravity at the highest point, which will cause it to start falling back down. This means that the ball will be accelerating downwards at 9.8 m/s^2 at the highest point.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThis statement is true. The time it takes for the ball to travel up to the highest point is equal to the time it takes to fall back down. This is because the ball's speed is 0 m/s at the highest point, so it cannot travel up or down any faster.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) I only.",

Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\nF_A = k * (2Q * Q) / r^2\nF_B = k * (Q * Q) / r^2\n\nWe want to find the ratio of the magnitudes of the forces on particles A and B. To do this, we can divide the force on particle A by the force on particle B:\n\nF_A / F_B = (k * (2Q * Q) / r^2) / (k * (Q * Q) / r^2)\n\nSince k is the same in both equations, we can cancel it out:\n\nF_A / F_B = (2Q * Q) / (Q * Q)\n\nNow we can simplify the expression:\n\nF_A / F_B = 2\n\nSo the ratio of the magnitudes of the electric forces on particles A and B is 2:01.
