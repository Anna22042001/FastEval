            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) conducting but non-magnetic materials.\n\nReasoning:\n\nInduction heating is a process where heat is generated in an object by electromagnetic induction. This means that the object is heated by electromagnetic waves, which are generated by a coil of wire.\n\nFor induction heating to take place, the object must be able to conduct electricity. This is because the electromagnetic waves must be able to pass through the object and induce a current in it.\n\nHowever, the object does not have to be magnetic. This is because magnetic materials can interfere with the electromagnetic waves and reduce the efficiency of the heating process. Therefore, the object must be conducting but non-magnetic.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) conducting but non-magnetic materials.",

The frequency of the supply is an important factor in determining the efficiency of this process.\n\nLow frequency supply is necessary for direct core type induction furnaces because magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor. This means that the electromagnetic field generated by the primary coil is not effectively transferred to the secondary coil, which is in contact with the metal being heated.\n\nIf the frequency were too high, the electromagnetic forces would cause severe stirring action in the molten metal, which would disrupt the heating process and make it difficult to maintain a uniform temperature.
