            "model_answer": "The first buffer overflow attack was the (C) Morris Worm. It was launched in 1988 by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University. The worm was designed to spread across the Internet and infect computers running the Unix operating system. It exploited a vulnerability in the sendmail program, which allowed it to replicate itself and spread rapidly. The attack caused significant disruption to the nascent Internet, with an estimated 10% of all connected computers being affected. It was the first major computer worm and demonstrated the potential for malicious attacks on computer networks.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions.\n\nReasoning:\n\nApps developed in languages like C and C++ use pointers to represent memory addresses. Pointers are used to access data stored in memory. When a program is written, it is possible to create a buffer overflow by writing data to a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated memory. This can lead to the corruption of data and even code execution with elevated privileges.\n\nIn C and C++, predefined functions like `scanf`, `printf`, and `strcpy` do not perform string boundary checks. This means that if a programmer uses these functions without properly checking the input data, it is possible to write data to a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated memory, leading to a buffer overflow.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions.",

If Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, it would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser. This is because file descriptors are used to represent open files, including sockets that are used to establish a connection with the client. Without file descriptor passing, services would not be able to obtain a file descriptor for the client's TCP connection, making it impossible to establish a connection.\n2.

A proxy server and a firewall operate at the lower layers of the OSI model.\n\n(C) Data link layer: This option is not relevant as it refers to the layer that deals with the reliable transmission of data between two nodes on a network. A proxy server and a firewall operate at the network layer or above.\n\n(D) Network layer: This option is correct. A proxy rewall lters at the Network layer of the OSI model.

This can result in the overwrite of important data structures, such as the return address of a function. When a function is called, the instruction pointer (EIP) is set to the address of the function's entry point. When the function returns, the instruction pointer is set to the address of the next instruction to be executed. If the return address has been overwritten by the attacker, the instruction pointer will now point to the location of the attacker-injected code. This allows the attacker to execute their code in the context of the vulnerable program, which can lead to further exploitation and control of the system.",
