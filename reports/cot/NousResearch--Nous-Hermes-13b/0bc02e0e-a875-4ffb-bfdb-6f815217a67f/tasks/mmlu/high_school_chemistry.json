            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To find the empirical formula, we need to determine the mole ratio of carbon to hydrogen in the compound. \n\n1. Calculate the total mass of carbon and hydrogen in the compound: \nTotal mass of C = 18.02 g\nTotal mass of H = 3.03 g\nTotal mass of C and H = 21.05 g\n\n2. Calculate the mole ratio of C to H: \nMole ratio of C to H = (Total mass of C) / (Total mass of H)\nMole ratio of C to H = 18.02 g / 3.03 g = 5.95 \u2248 6\n\n3. Since the mole ratio is a whole number, the empirical formula will have the same ratio: \nThe empirical formula will have a ratio of 6:1 for carbon to hydrogen. \n\n4. Now we need to determine the mass of oxygen in the compound: \nSince the compound also contains oxygen, we can use the mass of the compound and the known mass of carbon and hydrogen to calculate the mass of oxygen. \n\nMass of O = Total mass of compound - Total mass of C - Total mass of H\nMass of O = 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g = 8.00 g\n\n5. Calculate the mole ratio of C to O: \nMole ratio of C to O = (Total mass of C) / (Mass of O)\nMole ratio of C to O = 18.02 g / 8.00 g = 2.25 \u2248 2\n\n6. Calculate the mole ratio of H to O: \nMole ratio of H to O = (Total mass of H) / (Mass of O)\nMole ratio of H to O = 3.03 g / 8.00 g = 0.375 \u2248 1/3\n\n7. The empirical formula is C2H2O since the mole ratio of C to H is 2:1 and the mole ratio of H to O is 1:3. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) C2H6O3.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A). \nThe electronegativity of an element is a measure of its ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. It is influenced by factors such as the size of the atom, the number of protons and electrons, and the effective nuclear charge. \nPhosphorus has an electronegativity value of 2.28, while nitrogen has a value of 3.04, and oxygen has a value of 3.44. \nAccording to the given options, (A) states that nitrogen's electronegativity value is less than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is larger, but greater than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a greater effective nuclear charge. \nThis option correctly explains the relationship between the three values based on the factors that influence electronegativity. Nitrogen is larger than phosphorus, which means it has a larger atom size. However, nitrogen has a greater effective nuclear charge than phosphorus, which means it has a stronger attraction for electrons. This results in nitrogen having a higher electronegativity value than phosphorus. \nOn the other hand, nitrogen has a lower electronegativity value than oxygen, which means it has a weaker attraction for electrons.
