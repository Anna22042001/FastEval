            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which country is the least self-sufficient in natural resources, we need to consider the availability of resources such as minerals, fossil fuels, and arable land. \n\n(A) United States: The United States is rich in natural resources, including minerals, fossil fuels, and arable land. It is a major producer of coal, natural gas, and petroleum, and has abundant arable land for agriculture. Therefore, the United States is not the least self-sufficient in natural resources.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is an industrialized country that relies heavily on imports for its natural resources. It has limited natural resources, including minerals, fossil fuels, and arable land. Therefore, Japan is less self-sufficient in natural resources than the United States.\n\n(C) France: France is a developed country with a diverse economy that includes agriculture, manufacturing, and services. It has a relatively small land area, but it is rich in minerals and has some fossil fuel reserves. However, it is not as self-sufficient in natural resources as the United States or Japan.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom is a developed country with a diverse economy that includes agriculture, manufacturing, and services. It has limited natural resources, including minerals, fossil fuels, and arable land. Therefore, it is less self-sufficient in natural resources than France.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the country that is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry is Japan.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) contagious diffusion.\n\nReasoning:\nContagious diffusion refers to the spread of information or ideas from one person or group to another in a manner that resembles the spread of a contagious disease. This process is often facilitated by social interactions and communication technologies.\n\nOn the other hand, relocation diffusion involves the movement of people from one location to another, carrying with them cultural or social practices. This process is often associated with migration and population movement.\n\nInnovative diffusion refers to the spread of new ideas or technologies that are perceived as better or more effective than existing ones. This process is often driven by the desire to improve or change existing practices.\n\nHierarchical diffusion refers to the top-down dissemination of information or ideas, where decisions are made by a few individuals at the top and then communicated down the chain of command. This process is often associated with bureaucratic or hierarchical organizations.\n\nTherefore, contagious diffusion is the most appropriate answer for the initial spread of information about a new fashion design.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D). \n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is based on the idea that regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade. This means that the core will continue to dominate the periphery, but the periphery can also benefit from trade and investment. \n\nThe other statements are all part of Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. Statement (A) suggests that trade can help both developed and developing regions share wealth. Statement (B) suggests that the core will always dominate the periphery, but the periphery can benefit from trade and investment. Statement (C) suggests that growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery, but the periphery can also benefit from trade and investment. \n\nTherefore, statement (D) is the one that is NOT part of Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.",

Additionally, they are not limited to the western hemisphere, with cities such as Dubai and Hong Kong being examples of world cities in the eastern hemisphere.\n\nTherefore, option (D) is the one that does not fit the characteristics of world cities.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) agglomeration.\n\nReasoning:\nAgglomeration refers to the concentration of production activities and people spatially to benefit everyone. This is done to take advantage of the economies of scale, where the cost per unit of output decreases as the scale of production increases. This is also known as the location theory in economics.\n\nThe substitution principle refers to the idea that as the price of one good increases, people will switch to another good that is relatively cheaper.\n\nDeglomeration refers to the process of decentralizing or dispersing activities and people from urban areas to rural areas.\n\nInfrastructure refers to the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise. While infrastructure is important for agglomeration, it is not the same as agglomeration itself.",

These activities are typically associated with rural areas and are often labor-intensive. \n\nThe secondary sector includes activities such as manufacturing and construction. These activities are typically associated with urban areas and require skilled labor. \n\nThe tertiary sector includes activities such as retail, hospitality, and services.
