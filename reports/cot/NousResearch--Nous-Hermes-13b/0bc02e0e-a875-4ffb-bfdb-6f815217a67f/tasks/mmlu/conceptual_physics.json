            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) All of these.\n\nReasoning:\n\nGeneral relativity, a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein, describes the gravitational force as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This curvature affects the motion of objects, including light, in the presence of gravity.\n\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity: This is a direct consequence of general relativity. As light travels through the curved spacetime around the Sun, it loses energy and its speed decreases. This effect is known as gravitational redshift and has been experimentally confirmed.\n\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected: According to general relativity, light is deflected by the gravitational field of massive objects. This effect was first observed during the solar eclipse of 1919, when the stars near the Sun were found to be slightly displaced from their expected positions. This observation provided strong evidence for general relativity.\n\n(C) A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth: This is another consequence of general relativity. Due to the stronger gravitational field on the Sun, time runs faster for an observer at the Sun's surface compared to an observer on Earth. This effect is known as gravitational time dilation and has been experimentally confirmed using atomic clocks.\n\nTherefore, all three statements are correct predictions of general relativity.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the function of a galvanometer. A galvanometer is an instrument used to measure electric current. It consists of a small coil of wire suspended between the poles of a magnet and connected to an indicator, such as a needle on a scale. When an electric current passes through the coil, it experiences a magnetic force, causing the needle to deflect.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Current: This is the most likely option, as a galvanometer is designed to measure current.\n\n(B) Voltage: While voltage is an important concept in electricity, it is not directly measured by a galvanometer. A voltmeter is used to measure voltage.\n\n(C) Either of these: This option is not valid, as we have already discussed that a galvanometer measures current, not voltage.\n\n(D) Neither of these: This option is also not valid, as we have already established that a galvanometer measures current.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Current.",

            "correct_answer": 3,

This is due to the principle of electromagnetic induction, which states that a change in magnetic field in a closed loop of wire will induce an electromotive force (EMF) or voltage in the wire.

The centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force between the satellite and the Earth.\n\nThe gravitational force between two objects is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n\nF = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2\n\nwhere F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nFor a satellite in a circular orbit around the Earth, the gravitational force is directed towards the center of the Earth, and the centripetal force is directed towards the center of the orbit.
