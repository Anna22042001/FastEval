            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) 19,000\u201320,000.\n\nReasoning:\nThe question asks for the number of human protein-coding genes. This refers to the total number of genes in the human genome that are responsible for producing proteins.\n\nIn 2003, the Human Genome Project estimated that there were approximately 30,000 to 40,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. However, more recent research has suggested that this estimate may be reduced over time.\n\nOne study published in 2012 estimated that there were approximately 19,000 to 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. This is the most widely accepted estimate as of now.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 19,000\u201320,000.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:\n\n(A) a deletion.\n\nExplanation: Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a protein that helps regulate the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides (guanine, adenine, and thymine) in the CFTR gene. This deletion results in the loss of a single amino acid in the CFTR protein, which disrupts its function and leads to the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.",

We know that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have only explained a small percentage of the variation in body mass index (BMI) despite the evidence from twin and family studies that suggests greater than 50% heritability. \n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to compare the percentage of variation in BMI explained by GWAS to the greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies. \n\nSince GWAS has only explained a small percentage of the variation in BMI, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) as they suggest a higher percentage of explanation than what GWAS has actually achieved. \n\nBetween options (B) and (C), we know that GWAS has explained only a small percentage of the variation in BMI. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer as it suggests that GWAS has explained less than 1% of the variation in BMI.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of Mendelian inheritance and the role of phenylketonuria (PKU) in this process. \n\nPhenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the PAH gene, which is responsible for the production of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of the amino acid phenylalanine to another amino acid, tyrosine. When the PAH gene is mutated, the enzyme's function is impaired, leading to a buildup of phenylalanine in the blood and brain, which can cause intellectual disability and other neurological problems if left untreated.\n\nNow, let's analyze the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU:\n\n(A) 1%: This option is incorrect because it contradicts the Mendelian inheritance principle. According to this principle, the risk of having a child with a genetic disorder is independent of the sex of the parents and depends only on their genotype. Since the mother has PKU, she is a carrier of the mutated PAH gene, and there is a 50% chance that she will pass it on to her child, regardless of the child's sex. Therefore, the risk of having a child with PKU cannot be 1%.\n\n(B) 10%: This option is incorrect because it contradicts the Mendelian inheritance principle. As explained earlier, the risk of having a child with PKU depends only on the mother's genotype and not on the sex of the parents. Therefore, the risk cannot be 10%.\n\n(C) 25%: This option is incorrect because it contradicts the Mendelian inheritance principle. As explained earlier, the risk of having a child with PKU depends only on the mother's genotype and not on the sex of the parents. Therefore, the risk cannot be 25%.\n\n(D) Almost 100%: This option is correct. As explained earlier, if the mother has PKU, there is a 50% chance that she will pass on the mutated PAH gene to her child. Since PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, if both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that their child will have PKU, a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will not be a carrier or have PKU. In this case, the child would have a 50% chance of having PKU if the father is also a carrier. Therefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is almost 100%.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Low density lipoprotein receptor. \n\nReasoning: \nFamilial hypercholesterolaemia is a genetic disorder that results in high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. This is due to mutations in the gene that encodes the LDL receptor, which is responsible for removing LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. When the LDL receptor is not functioning properly, LDL cholesterol cannot be removed efficiently, leading to high levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. Therefore, the gene that encodes the LDL receptor is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross.\n\nReasoning:\nQTL stands for Quantitative Trait Locus. A complex trait is a phenotype that is influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. QTL analysis is a technique used to identify the chromosome regions that are associated with these complex traits. This is done by crossing two strains of organisms and then analyzing the offspring to see if there are any differences in the trait of interest. If a particular chromosome region is found to be associated with the trait, it suggests that there may be one or more genes in that region that are contributing to the trait.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nAn Hfr strain of E. coli is a type of F factor (F-mediated transformation) strain that can take up foreign DNA from the environment. This foreign DNA can be from a vector (A), which is a DNA molecule that can replicate itself in a host organism and can be used to make many copies of a particular DNA sequence. However, option A is not specific to E. coli or Hfr strains, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nAnother option is a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted (C). The F factor is a plasmid that can be transferred between bacteria through a process called conjugation. However, the F factor is not responsible for the Hfr phenotype, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nThe remaining options are (D) a human chromosome with a transposable element inserted and (B) a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted. A human chromosome with a transposable element inserted would not be found in an E. coli strain, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted.",

A point mutation is when a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) is changed in the DNA sequence.\n\nIn the case of \u03b1-thalassaemia, the common mutation is a deletion.
