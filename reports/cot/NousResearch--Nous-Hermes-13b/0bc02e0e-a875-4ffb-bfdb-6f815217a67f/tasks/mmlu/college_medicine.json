When lactate leaves the muscle and enters the circulation, it needs to be removed from the body. \n\nOption (A) conversion to urea in the liver is not the main fate of lactate because urea is a waste product of protein metabolism and is not formed from lactate.\n\nOption (B) conversion to glucose in the heart is also not the main fate of lactate because the heart primarily uses glucose and fatty acids for energy, not lactate.\n\nOption (C) excretion via the kidneys is not the main fate of lactate because lactate is not a waste product that needs to be excreted from the body.\n\nTherefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) genetically determined.\n\nReasoning:\n\nDNA is a double-stranded molecule, meaning that there are two strands of nucleotides that are twisted together to form the DNA molecule. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four types of nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\n\nThe ratio of purines : pyrimidines refers to the number of adenine (A) and guanine (G) molecules compared to the number of cytosine (C) and thymine (T) molecules in the DNA molecule.\n\nOption (A) variable is incorrect because the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is a fixed value in all living organisms. It is approximately 1:1, meaning that there is one adenine molecule for every one cytosine molecule and one guanine molecule for every one thymine molecule.\n\nOption (B) determined by the base sequence in RNA is also incorrect because the base sequence in RNA is not directly related to the base sequence in DNA. The base sequence in RNA is determined by the base sequence in DNA through the process of transcription.\n\nOption (D) always 1:1 is incorrect because the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is not always exactly 1:1. However, it is very close to 1:1 in most organisms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) genetically determined, as the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is a fixed value that is determined by the genetic code and is present in all living organisms.",

This means that the cell will not be able to produce ATP, which is the primary energy currency of the cell. \n\nNow let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Oxaloacetate: This molecule is involved in the citric acid cycle, which is part of cellular respiration. Without oxygen, the citric acid cycle will stop producing oxaloacetate.\n\n(B) Pyruvate: This molecule is also involved in cellular respiration, specifically in the process of glycolysis. Without oxygen, glycolysis will stop producing pyruvate.\n\n(C) Water: Water is not produced or consumed during cellular respiration. It is a byproduct of the process.\n\n(D) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP): ATP is produced during cellular respiration, specifically in the final step of the process. Without oxygen, the cell will not be able to produce ATP.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is (D) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the role of intracellular buffers in maintaining pH homeostasis and the relationship between glycolysis and pH regulation.\n\nGlycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, which generates ATP and NADH. When the rate of glycolysis is high, the cell produces more ATP and NADH, which can lead to an increase in the production of lactic acid, which can cause a decrease in pH.\n\nIntracellular buffers are molecules that can absorb and release protons (H+) to maintain pH homeostasis. The most common intracellular buffer is bicarbonate (HCO3-). However, glutamine, carnosine, and amylase are not typically considered intracellular buffers.\n\nGlutamine is an amino acid that plays a role in nitrogen metabolism and can be involved in the regulation of pH in certain cell types. However, it is not typically considered an intracellular buffer in the context of pH regulation during high glycolysis.\n\nCarnosine is a dipeptide that has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-glycating properties, but it is not typically considered an intracellular buffer.\n\nAmylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars, but it is not involved in pH regulation or glycolysis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Glutamine.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.\n\nReasoning:\nIn games like soccer, the blood lactate concentration is a measure of the amount of lactate in the blood, which is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism. As the game progresses, the players become more fatigued and rely more on anaerobic metabolism, which leads to an increase in blood lactate concentration. However, the first half of the game is typically less intense than the second half, so the blood lactate concentration is usually higher at the end of the first half than at the end of the game.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) 50-60 seconds.\n\nReasoning:\nThe energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine is used to power muscle contractions during exercise. The high-energy phosphates are used in a process called anaerobic metabolism, which is the primary source of energy for short, intense activities.\n\nDuring maximal exertion exercise, the body relies heavily on these high-energy phosphates to produce energy. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain muscle contractions for a short period of time, but it is not enough to maintain them for an extended period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 50-60 seconds.",
