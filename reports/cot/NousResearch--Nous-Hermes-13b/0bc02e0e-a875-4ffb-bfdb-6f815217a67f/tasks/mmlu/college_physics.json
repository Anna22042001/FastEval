The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position.

            "model_answer": "To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the potential energy stored in the spring and the kinetic energy of the mass.\n\nFirst, let's find the potential energy stored in the spring. The potential energy of a spring is given by the formula:\n\nPE_spring = (1/2) * k * x^2\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. Since the spring is massless, the spring constant k is equal to the mass (m) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (g):\n\nk = m * g\n\nThe mass (m) is given as 0.30 kg, and the acceleration due to gravity (g) is approximately 9.81 m/s^2. Therefore, the spring constant (k) is:\n\nk = 0.30 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 2.943 m/s^2\n\nThe displacement (x) is given as 0.030 m. Now we can find the potential energy stored in the spring:\n\nPE_spring = (1/2) * 2.943 m/s^2 * (0.030 m)^2 = 0.0147 mJ\n\nNext, let's find the kinetic energy of the mass. The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula:\n\nKE = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere m is the mass and v is the velocity of the object. The mass (m) is given as 0.30 kg, and the velocity (v) is given as 0.040 m/s. Now we can find the kinetic energy:\n\nKE = (1/2) * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.0048 mJ\n\nFinally, we can find the total mechanical energy of the system by adding the potential energy stored in the spring and the kinetic energy of the mass:\n\nTotal mechanical energy = PE_spring + KE = 0.0147 mJ + 0.0048 mJ = 0.0195 mJ\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is (A) 0.24 mJ.",

Since the box is initially moving at 1 m/s and after applying the force it moves 5 m with a final speed of 2 m/s, we can calculate the acceleration as follows:\n\nFinal velocity (v_f) = Initial velocity (v_i) + Acceleration (a)\n2 m/s = 1 m/s + a\na = 1 m/s\n\nNow that we have the acceleration, we can find the force applied to the box using Newton's second law:\n\nForce (F) = Mass (m) x Acceleration (a)\n\nWe are not given the mass of the box, but we can still determine the magnitude of the force by dividing both sides of the equation by the acceleration:\n\nForce (F) / Acceleration (a) = Mass (m)\n\nSince we don't know the mass of the box, we cannot determine the exact magnitude of the force. However, we can say that the magnitude of the force is equal to the mass of the box multiplied by the acceleration. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 1 N",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use Snell's Law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two media. \n\nn1 * sin(\u03b81) = n2 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, and \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\nIn this case, the white light is incident on the puddle, and the thin layer of oil floats on the surface. The index of refraction of air is approximately 1. So, we have three interfaces to consider: air-puddle, puddle-oil, and oil-air.\n\nAt the air-puddle interface, the angle of refraction is 90 degrees, so sin(\u03b81) = 1. The index of refraction of the puddle is 1.33, and the index of refraction of air is 1. So, we have:\n\n1.33 * 1 = 1 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nsin(\u03b82) = 1/1.33\n\nAt the puddle-oil interface, the angle of refraction is also 90 degrees, so sin(\u03b81) = 1. The index of refraction of the oil is 1.5, and the index of refraction of the puddle is 1.33. So, we have:\n\n1.33 * 1 = 1.5 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nsin(\u03b82) = 1/1.5\n\nAt the oil-air interface, the angle of refraction is again 90 degrees, so sin(\u03b81) = 1. The index of refraction of the oil is 1.5, and the index of refraction of air is 1. So, we have:\n\n1.5 * 1 = 1 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nsin(\u03b82) = 1/1.5\n\nNow, we can use Snell's Law to find the wavelengths of light that are most strongly reflected at each interface. The most strongly reflected wavelength will be the one that undergoes total internal reflection.\n\nAt the air-puddle interface, the critical angle (\u03b8c) is:\n\nsin(\u03b8c) = n2/n1\nsin(\u03b8c) = 1.33/1\n\u03b8c = arcsin(1) = 45 degrees\n\nThe critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. So, the most strongly reflected wavelength at this interface is:\n\n\u03bb_c = 2 * \u03c0 * sin(\u03b8c) / \u03bb_oil\n\u03bb_c = 2 * \u03c0 * sin(45) / 500 nm\n\u03bb_c \u2248 380 nm\n\nAt the puddle-oil interface, the critical angle is the same as at the air-puddle interface, so the most strongly reflected wavelength is also:\n\n\u03bb_c = 380 nm\n\nAt the oil-air interface, the critical angle is:\n\nsin(\u03b8c) = n2/n1\nsin(\u03b8c) = 1.5/1.33\n\u03b8c = arcsin(1.5/1.33) \u2248 64.2 degrees\n\nThe critical angle is the angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction is 90 degrees. So, the most strongly reflected wavelength at this interface is:\n\n\u03bb_c = 2 * \u03c0 * sin(\u03b8c) / \u03bb_air\n\u03bb_c = 2 * \u03c0 * sin(64.2) / 500 nm\n\u03bb_c \u2248 500 nm\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength at each interface is:\n\nA) 500 nm",
