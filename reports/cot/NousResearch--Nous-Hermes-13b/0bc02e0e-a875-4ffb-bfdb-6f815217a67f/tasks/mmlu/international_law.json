            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.\n\nReasoning:\nInternational legal personality refers to the ability of an entity to engage in legal relations with other entities. This includes the ability to enter into contracts, sue and be sued, and enjoy other legal rights and responsibilities.\n\nStates and international organizations are generally considered to have full international legal personality, meaning they can engage in legal relations with other entities without any limitations.\n\nHowever, the situation is different for individuals. While individuals do enjoy international legal personality, this is limited in some ways. For example, individuals cannot enter into treaties or other international agreements on their own behalf. They can only do so through their governments. Additionally, individuals may not have the same legal capacity as States or international organizations, meaning they may not be able to engage in all the same legal relations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B). \n\nExplanation: \n\nCollective rights refer to the rights that belong to particular groups of people, as opposed to the individual members of the group. These rights are often associated with minority groups or groups that have been historically marginalized or oppressed. Collective rights are distinct from individual rights, which are rights that belong to an individual person and cannot be taken away or denied based on their membership in a particular group. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B), as it accurately describes the meaning of collective rights as belonging to particular groups of people, rather than being individual rights.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The fundamental premise of monist theory is that international law and domestic law are part of the same legal order. This means that international law is not separate or superior to domestic law, but rather the two are interconnected and can influence each other. Monist theory therefore posits that domestic courts have the authority to apply international law, and that international law can be used as a source of law in domestic legal systems.",

            "question": "Which of the following cases best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights?\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978)\n(B) A v UK (2009)\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002)\n(D) Osman v UK (1998)",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' is a concept used by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a dynamic and evolving manner. This principle allows the Court to adapt the Convention to new circumstances and to develop its interpretation in light of changing social, cultural, and political realities.\n\nTo determine which case best illustrates this principle, we need to look at the way the ECtHR has applied the principle in its judgments. A case that demonstrates the living instrument principle is one in which the Court has interpreted the Convention in a way that is consistent with its object and purpose, while also taking into account new developments and trends in international law and human rights.\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978) - This case concerned the right to a fair trial and the right to respect for private and family life. While the Court found a violation of these rights, it did not explicitly mention the living instrument principle.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009) - This case concerned the right to private and family life and the best interests of the child. The Court held that the right to family life could include same-sex couples and that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in any decision affecting the child. This case demonstrates the living instrument principle because the Court interpreted the Convention in a way that is consistent with its object and purpose, while also taking into account new developments in international law and human rights.\n\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002) - This case concerned the right to freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial. The Court found a violation of these rights, but again, it did not explicitly mention the living instrument principle.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998) - This case concerned the right to life and the right to an effective remedy. The Court held that the UK government had failed to protect the lives of three individuals who had been killed by loyalist paramilitaries. This case also does not explicitly mention the living instrument principle.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the case that best illustrates the living instrument principle is (B) A v UK (2009).",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law.\n\nReasoning:\nThe doctrine of incorporation is a legal principle that holds that international law, including treaties, becomes part of the domestic law of a country. This means that once a treaty is ratified by a country, it automatically becomes part of the country's legal system and is binding on its citizens and government.
