            "model_answer": "To find the probability that $x < y$, we need to consider the area of the rectangle that corresponds to this condition. The rectangle has vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$. \n\nFirst, we need to find the area of the rectangle. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula $Area = base \\times height$. In this case, the base is the distance between the first and second vertices $(3,0)$ and $(3,2)$, which is $3$. The height is the distance between the third and fourth vertices $(0,2)$ and $(0,0)$, which is $2$. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the portion of the rectangle that corresponds to the condition $x < y$. This is the area of a right triangle with hypotenuse $3$ and base $x$. The height of this triangle is $y$. The area of a triangle is given by the formula $Area = \\frac{base \\times height}{2}$. Therefore, the area of the portion of the rectangle that corresponds to the condition $x < y$ is $\\frac{x \\times y}{2}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the entire rectangle that corresponds to the condition $x < y$. This is the area of the portion of the rectangle that corresponds to the condition $x < y$ multiplied by the ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the entire rectangle. Therefore, the area of the entire rectangle that corresponds to the condition $x < y$ is $\\frac{\\frac{x \\times y}{2}}{6} = \\frac{xy}{12}$.\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that $x < y$ by dividing the area of the rectangle that corresponds to this condition by the total area of the rectangle. Therefore, the probability that $x < y$ is $\\frac{\\frac{xy}{12}}{6} = \\frac{xy}{72}$.\n\nNow, we can use the given options to find the correct answer. The probability that $x < y$ is $\\frac{xy}{72}$. Therefore, the answer is (A) $\\frac{1}{12}$.",
