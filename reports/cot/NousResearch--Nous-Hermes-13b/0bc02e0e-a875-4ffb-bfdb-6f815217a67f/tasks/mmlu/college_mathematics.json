            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the work done by the force F on the particle as it moves along the given path. We can use the formula for work done by a constant force:\n\nW = F * d\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force, and d is the displacement of the particle along the path.\n\nFirst, we need to find the displacement d. We can do this by finding the difference between the initial and final positions of the particle. The initial position is (0, 0, 0), and the final position is (1, 1, 1). So, the displacement d is:\n\nd = (1, 1, 1) - (0, 0, 0) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nNow, we need to find the component of the force F that is parallel to the displacement d. Since F is parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1), the component of F that is parallel to d is simply F itself:\n\nF_parallel = F\n\nNow we can find the work done by the force F on the particle as it moves along the given path:\n\nW = F * d = F * (1, 1, 1)\n\nSince F is a constant unit force, we can write:\n\nW = F * (1, 1, 1) = F * (1, 1, 1)\n\nNow we need to find the value of F. We can do this by using the given information about the force F being parallel to the vector (-1, 0, 1). This means that the force F is in the same direction as the displacement d, which is (1, 1, 1). Therefore, the magnitude of F is equal to the magnitude of the displacement d:\n\n|F| = |(1, 1, 1)| = 1\n\nSo, the work done by the force F on the particle as it moves along the given path is:\n\nW = F * d = 1 * (1, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) -1/4.",

In the context of R^n, this means that every open cover of K has a finite subcover that covers K. \nNow, let's consider a continuous real-valued function defined on K. If K is compact, then there exists a finite subcover of the open cover of K that consists of open balls centered at the function values of the function. This means that the function must be bounded, as there are only finitely many function values. Therefore, statement I must be true.\n\nNext, let's consider statement II: \"If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\"\nThis statement is the converse of statement I. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K must be compact. This is because if K were not compact, there would exist an open cover of K that does not have a finite subcover. However, this would mean that there is no finite subcover of the open cover consisting of open balls centered at the function values of any continuous real-valued function defined on K, which contradicts the assumption that every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded. Therefore, statement II must be true.\n\nFinally, let's consider statement III: \"If K is compact, then K is connected.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily true. There exist compact subsets of R^n that are not connected. For example, consider the set K = {(x, y) in R^2 | x = 0} which is a vertical line segment in R^2. This set is compact, but it is not connected, as it can be written as the union of two nonempty, disjoint, open sets: one containing the points (0, y) and the other containing the points (0, -y) for any y in R.
