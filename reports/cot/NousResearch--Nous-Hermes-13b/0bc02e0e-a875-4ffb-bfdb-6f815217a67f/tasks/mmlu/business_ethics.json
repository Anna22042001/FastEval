The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a piece of legislation that was passed in the United States in response to several high-profile corporate scandals. It is designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures and to prevent fraudulent practices. \n\nWhile legislation can certainly play a role in driving ethical business practices, it is not the only factor. Internal company policy is also an important driver of ethical behavior. Companies have their own codes of conduct and policies that govern the behavior of their employees. These policies can include rules about conflicts of interest, bribery, and other unethical practices. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",
