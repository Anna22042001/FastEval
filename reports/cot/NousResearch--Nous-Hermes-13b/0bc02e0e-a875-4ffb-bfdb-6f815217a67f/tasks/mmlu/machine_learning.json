            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) The use of a constant-term unit input.\n\nReasoning:\nThe trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network is mainly determined by the complexity of the model. The use of a constant-term unit input can affect this complexity. \n\nIf a constant-term unit input is used, it means that the neural network is essentially a linear model, which is a simple model with low complexity. This can lead to underfitting, as the model may not be able to capture the complexity of the data. \n\nOn the other hand, if a constant-term unit input is not used, the neural network can have higher complexity, which can help it capture the complexity of the data better. However, this can also lead to overfitting, as the model may be too complex and fit the noise in the data.\n\nTherefore, the use of a constant-term unit input is the structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network.",

This helps to reduce overfitting by encouraging the model to learn simpler weights. \n\nAs we increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, the weights will be penalized more heavily, which will result in a decrease in the magnitude of the weights. This means that the model will be less sensitive to the individual features, which can help to reduce overfitting.\n\nHowever, the $\\ell_2$ regularization does not directly affect the bias of the model. The bias is a constant term that is added to the linear combination of the features, and it does not change as the weights are updated.\n\nTherefore, as we increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, the variance of the model will decrease. This is because the model will learn to rely more on the overall trend of the data, rather than the individual features. However, the effect on the bias will be minimal, and it will remain constant.\n\nSo the answer is (C) Bias decrease ; Variance increase.",

When we map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space using a kernel function, it can help to separate the classes better. The 1-NN algorithm, which is a simple classifier that assigns a point to the class with the nearest neighbor, can potentially perform better in the feature space than in the original space.

The VC dimension is a measure of the complexity of a classifier, and it is defined as the minimum number of linearly separable classes that the classifier can classify. For a Perceptron, the VC dimension is 1, while for a simple linear SVM, the VC dimension is also 1. Therefore, the VC dimension of a Perceptron is not smaller than that of a simple linear SVM.",

This can lead to sparser models, as it discourages the inclusion of irrelevant features. On the other hand, L1 regularization adds a penalty term that encourages the model to have only non-zero weights, which can also lead to sparser models.
