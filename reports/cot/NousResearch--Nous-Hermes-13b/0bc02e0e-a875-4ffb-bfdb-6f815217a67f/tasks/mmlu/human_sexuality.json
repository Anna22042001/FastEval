            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) preovulation. \n\nReasoning: \nThe process of sperm passage begins with ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovary. The egg then travels down the fallopian tube, where it can be fertilized by sperm. The environment for sperm passage is most hospitable just before ovulation, when the egg is released and is at its most receptive state. This is known as the \"window of fertility.\" \n\nPreovulation is the time period immediately preceding ovulation, during which the female reproductive system is most conducive to the passage of sperm. This is because the cervical mucus is at its most fertile state, providing a sperm-friendly environment for the sperm to swim through. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) preovulation.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) penis. \n\nReasoning: \n\nGonorrhea and chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections that primarily affect the genitals. In men, the most common site of infection is the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body. However, these infections can also spread to the penis, scrotum, and other surrounding areas. \n\nWhile gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the scrotum and bladder in men, the penis is the most common site of infection for these two STIs.

These acts may vary from one society to another, but there are some acts that are considered taboo in most societies.\n\nOne such act is sex with a non-spouse if the person is married. This is considered taboo in most societies because it is seen as a breach of trust and loyalty to one's spouse.
