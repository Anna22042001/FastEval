            "model_answer": "The one skill that is not a key management skill in planning is (C) IT and computing skills. \n\nReasoning: \nManagement involves planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. While IT and computing skills may be important in certain industries or roles, they are not necessarily key skills for all managers. Conceptual skills (the ability to think abstractly and strategically) and analytical skills (the ability to analyze data and make decisions based on evidence) are essential for managers to develop and implement effective plans. Communication skills (the ability to communicate clearly and effectively with team members, stakeholders, and other managers) are also crucial for managers to ensure that their plans are understood and executed effectively. Therefore, while IT and computing skills may be useful, they are not as essential as conceptual and analytical skills and communication skills for managers in planning.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the characteristics of each type of culture mentioned in the options. \n\n(A) Team culture: This type of culture emphasizes teamwork, cooperation, and collaboration among team members. Workers in a team culture are more likely to accept change if it is presented as a way to improve the team's performance or achieve a common goal.\n\n(B) Collaborative culture: This type of culture encourages open communication, sharing of ideas, and working together to achieve common goals. Workers in a collaborative culture are more likely to accept change if they feel their input is valued and their ideas are considered.\n\n(C) Group culture: This type of culture emphasizes group cohesion and loyalty. Workers in a group culture may be more resistant to change because they value stability and continuity.\n\n(D) Collective culture: This type of culture emphasizes shared values and a sense of community. Workers in a collective culture are more likely to accept change if it aligns with the shared values and goals of the group.\n\nBased on this analysis, the type of culture that is most likely to accept change is (B) collaborative culture. This is because collaborative cultures emphasize open communication, sharing of ideas, and working together to achieve common goals. Workers in a collaborative culture are more likely to accept change if they feel their input is valued and their ideas are considered.",

This is because a corporate social responsibility framework is designed to promote sustainable development and address social and environmental issues, which involves more than just maintaining the current state of affairs. It requires understanding society and harnessing diversity to create positive change. Building capacity is important, but it is not a specific characteristic of a CSR framework.",
