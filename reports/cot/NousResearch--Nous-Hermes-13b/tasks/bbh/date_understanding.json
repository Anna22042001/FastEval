So the date in May 2020 was either the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of May. \n4. We can assume that the current date of 5/4/2021 means that it is the 4th day of the month of May in the year 2021. \n5. Therefore, yesterday's date (i.e., one year ago from today) would be one day prior to the current date which is the 3rd of May in the year 2020. \n6.
