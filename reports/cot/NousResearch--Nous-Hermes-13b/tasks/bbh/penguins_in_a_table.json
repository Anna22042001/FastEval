We can use this information to eliminate any penguin who does not have these characteristics.\nNext, we need to determine which penguin is the youngest. We can do this by comparing the ages of each penguin to the remaining penguins in the table. \nUsing this information, we can eliminate any penguin who has a different age than the youngest penguin. \nBased on the information given in the table, we can determine that the youngest penguin is Vincent, who is 9 years old. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Vincent.",
