The translation sentence contains \"German\" as well, so there is no error in this part of the sentence. \n\nThe next words in the source sentence are \"Nationaldenkm\u00e4ler des\". \"Nationaldenkm\u00e4ler\" directly translates to \"national monuments\", so there is no error in this part of the sentence. \"Des\" is a conjunction that means \"of\" in German, which is also correctly translated to \"of\" in the translation sentence. \n\nThe next word in the source sentence is \"19.\".

I find the phrase \"air-to-surface\" is the most suspicious part of the translation, as it suggests the FZ90 missile is designed to be launched from the air and to hit ground-based targets. The original German text does not mention the missile being used on aircraft and helicopters, so I suspect this information has been added in the translation.\n\n3. To clarify, the original text says \"Die FZ90 ist eine ungelenkte 70-mm-Luft-Boden-Rakete\". This literally translates to \"The FZ90 is an unguided 70 millimeter air-surface missile\". There is no mention of aircraft or helicopters in the original text. It seems the translator has added this information to the translation, which introduces a factual error not covered by the options provided.\n\n4. This error falls under the category of \"Dropped Content\" because the translator has failed to translate the entire meaning of the original text. The omission of the information about the missile being used on aircraft and helicopters could lead to misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions about the capabilities of the FZ90 missile.\n\n5.
