            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "1. Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 animated musical fantasy film. Independence Day is a 1996 science fiction film. Forrest Gump is a 1994 romactic-comedic drama film. Jurassic Park is a 1993 science fiction film. All four movies are quite different in terms of genres so I'll need to take that into account.\n\n2. The first step in finding a movie similar to all four of these films is to identify their common elements. I can start by looking at their genres:\n- Beauty and the Beast and Forrest Gump are both fantasy films, while Independence Day and Jurassic Park are science fiction films.\n- Beauty and the Beast and Forrest Gump both have a strong focus on character development and emotion, while Independence Day and Jurassic Park are more action-oriented.\n- All four movies have elements of drama, but Independence Day and Jurassic Park are more action-oriented and less focused on character development and emotion.\n\n3. Based on these common elements, I can start to get an idea of the type of movie that might be similar to all four of these films. I'm looking for a film that has elements of both science fiction and fantasy, with a strong focus on character development and emotion as well as some action.\n\n4. Based on my analysis so far, I can start to narrow down the options to the ones that seem to fit the criteria most closely. Options (A) and (B) are both crime thrillers, which don't fit the criteria at all. Option (C) is a medical thriller, which might have some elements of science fiction but doesn't seem to have much in common with the other films. Option (D) is a comedy",
