I begin by drawing out the initial book trading chain:\n\nA\u2014\u2014> C <\u2014\u2014 C\u2014\u2014 B <\u2014\u2014 B\n\nThis chain represents the ownership of each book at the end of the semester where the book swap is denoted by an arrow from one name to another. For example A\u2014\u2014> C denotes that Alice previously owned The Great Gatsby and had it traded to Claire.\n\n2. Alice now has the book, Ulysses, which she traded to Claire, who had previously traded to her The Great Gatsby\n\nA\u2014\u2014> C \u2014\u2014> A <\u2014\u2014 B\n\n3. Claire has traded with both Alice and Bob, and has not traded with Claire before, thus she has Frankenstein.\n\nA\u2014\u2014> C \u2014\u2014-> B <\u2014\u2014 B\n\n4. Bob has just traded with Claire and not anyone else, so he has Ulysses\n\nA\u2014\u2014> C \u2014\u2014> B \u2014\u2014-> C\n\n\n5. Alice traded Claire\u2019s copy of Ulysses, which she did not previously have, making Alice have The Great Gatsby as her book.\n\nA\u2014\u2014> C \u2014\u2014> B \u2014\u2014-> C <\u2014\u2014 A\n\nAfter the semester, Alice has The Great Gatsby. (A)\n\nThe best option after the semester is option  A, which is The Great Gatsby.",
