Again, the paragraph says that the robin is to the left of the blue jay, which means that the blue jay is not the rightmost bird. Therefore, option (B) is also not correct.\n\n6. Finally, I consider option (C). The paragraph does not provide any information about the position of the crow relative to the other birds. However, because the paragraph says that the robin is to the right of the crow, I can infer that the crow must be on the left of the robin, which means that the crow is the leftmost bird.
