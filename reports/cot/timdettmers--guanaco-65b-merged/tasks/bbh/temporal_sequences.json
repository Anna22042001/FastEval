Gathering information:\nWe know that Hannah woke up at 11am and the park was closed after 10pm.\nHannah's activities include:\ngetting a coffee at the cafe from 11am to 3pm\nbuying clothes at the mall from 3pm to 4pm\nwalking in the garden from 6pm to 8pm\nsitting on a rooftop from 8pm to 9pm\nwaiting at the train station from 9pm to 10pm\nTherefore, we can eliminate option (D), because Hannah was not in the park from 3pm to 4pm.\n\n2. Making assumptions:\nWe can assume that Hannah's activities took place consecutively, and she did not return to the park after leaving.\n\n3. Identifying constraints:\nHannah did not visit the park between 4pm and 6pm, because she was either in the garden or on the rooftop.\nHannah could not have visited the park between 6pm and 8pm, because she was walking in the garden.\nHannah could not have visited the park between 8pm and 9pm, because she was sitting on a rooftop.\nHannah could not have visited the park between 9pm and 10pm, because she was waiting at the train station.\n\n4. Drawing conclusions:\nBased on our assumptions and constraints, we can conclude that Hannah could not have visited the park at any time on that day. The correct answer is:\n(E) Hannah did not visit the park at all.\n\nFinal answer: (E)",
