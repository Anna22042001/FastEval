            "model_answer": "Sure, I can answer your question step-by-step. Here we go:\n\nFirst, let's look at statement I: \"The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\" This statement is true because when the ball reaches the highest point, it momentarily stops moving and its speed is zero. This is because the upward force from the ball's initial toss has balanced out the downward force of gravity, and the ball has reached its maximum height.\n\nNow, let's look at statement II: \"The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\" This statement is false. Acceleration is the rate of change of an object's velocity, and since the ball's speed is zero at the highest point, its acceleration is also zero. However, the ball is still experiencing a downward force of gravity, which means that it is accelerating towards the ground.\n\nFinally, let's look at statement III: \"The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\" This statement is also false. The ball takes the same amount of time to travel up to the highest point as it does to fall back down, assuming that air resistance is constant. This is because the ball's acceleration due to gravity is constant, and the time it takes to reach a certain height depends on the acceleration and the initial velocity.\n\nBased on these explanations, we can conclude that statement I is true, while statements II and III are false. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) I only.\n\n(A)",

The electric force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's Law:\n\nF = kQ1Q2/r^2\n\nwhere k is the Coulomb's constant, Q1 and Q2 are the charges of the two particles, and r is the distance between them.\n\nIn this case, we have Q1 = 2Q and Q2 = Q, and r = 4 m. Plugging in these values into Coulomb's Law, we get:\n\nF = (8.98 x 10^9)(2Q)(Q)/(4 m)^2\n\nF = (8.98 x 10^9)(2Q^2)/(4 m)^2\n\nNow, we need to take the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. We can do this by dividing the force on A by the force on B:\n\nF_A/F_B = (2Q^2)/(Q^2)\n\nF_A/F_B = 2\n\nSo, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is 2:1.\n\nFinally, we can look at the answer choices and see which one matches our calculation.

It is a fundamental property of the object and does not depend on the object's location or the forces acting on it.

It is proportional to the object's mass and depends on the strength of the gravitational field.\n\n(C) Velocity: Velocity is the rate of change of an object's position over time. It is a vector quantity that includes both the speed and direction of the object.\n\n(D) Inertial mass: Inertial mass is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its velocity.
