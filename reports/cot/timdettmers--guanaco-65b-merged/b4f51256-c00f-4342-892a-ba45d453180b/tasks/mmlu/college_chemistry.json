            "model_answer": "Alright, I will answer your question step-by-step:\n\n1. To determine which of the statements about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands is true, we need to have a basic understanding of what optical isomerism is.\n\n2. Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, which means that the molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity, but their atoms are arranged in space in a different way.\n\n3. In the case of optical isomerism, the molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning that they can be related to each other as a right hand and a left hand.\n\n4. When it comes to complexes containing achiral ligands, the ligands themselves are not chiral, but the overall complex can still be chiral if the arrangement of the ligands around the central atom is asymmetric.\n\n5. Now, let's look at the four statements one by one and determine which of them is true:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nThis statement is false. Square planar complexes can be chiral even if all four ligands are identical, as long as the arrangement of the ligands around the central atom is asymmetric.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nThis statement is also false. Tetrahedral complexes can be chiral if they have at least one chiral ligand, or if the arrangement of the ligands around the central atom is asymmetric.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nThis statement is also false. Linear complexes can be chiral if they have at least one chiral ligand, or if the arrangement of the ligands around the central atom is asymmetric.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nThis statement is true. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can only be chiral if they have at least three different ligands, because if they have only two ligands, the arrangement of the ligands around the central atom will always be symmetric.\n\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).\n\n7. (D) is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,

The chemical shift of a compound is a measure of how much its nucleus (in this case, the hydrogen nucleus) is shifted from the reference (TMS).\n\nThe chemical shift of a compound depends on several factors, including the electronegativity of the atoms surrounding the nucleus, the number of neighboring atoms, and the bonding between these atoms.\n\nFor the compounds given in the question, we can expect the chemical shift to increase as we go down the list, since the atoms get more electronegative (fluorine is the most electronegative, followed by chlorine, bromine, and iodine).\n\nTo calculate the chemical shift of each compound, we can use the following equation:\n\nchemical shift = \u03b4 (ppm) = \u03b40 + \u03c3 (electronegativity) + \u03c1 (number of neighboring atoms) + \u03c4 (bonding)\n\nwhere \u03b40 is the reference shift, \u03c3 is the electronegativity factor, \u03c1 is the number of neighboring atoms factor, and \u03c4 is the bonding factor.\n\nFor CH3F, we have:\n\n\u03b4 (ppm) = \u03b40 + (3.0 * 0) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) = \u03b40 + 2\n\nFor CH3Cl, we have:\n\n\u03b4 (ppm) = \u03b40 + (3.0 * 1) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) = \u03b40 + 4\n\nFor CH3Br, we have:\n\n\u03b4 (ppm) = \u03b40 + (3.0 * 2) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) = \u03b40 + 6\n\nFor CH3I, we have:\n\n\u03b4 (ppm) = \u03b40 + (3.0 * 3) + (1 * 1) + (1 * 1) = \u03b40 + 9\n\nNow, we need to find the approximate chemical shift of TMS. This can vary depending on the specific NMR spectrometer and conditions used, but a common value for the reference shift of TMS is around 0 ppm.\n\nSo, we can estimate the chemical shift of each compound relative to TMS as follows:\n\nCH3F: \u03b4 (ppm) = 2\nCH3Cl: \u03b4 (ppm) = 4\nCH3Br: \u03b4 (ppm) = 6\nCH3I: \u03b4 (ppm) = 9\n\nFinally, we can compare these values to the given frequency of 1.55 kHz. We can convert this frequency to ppm using the following equation:\n\n1 ppm = 1.05 Hz/G\n\nwhere G is the magnetic field strength of the NMR spectrometer (in this case, 12.0 T).\n\nSo, the frequency of 1.55 kHz corresponds to a chemical shift of approximately 1.63 ppm.\n\nNow, we can compare this value to the estimated chemical shifts of the compounds:\n\nCH3F: \u03b4 (ppm) = 2\nCH3Cl: \u03b4 (ppm) = 4\nCH3Br: \u03b4 (ppm) = 6\nCH3I: \u03b4 (ppm) = 9\n\nIt's clear that none of the compounds has a chemical shift of exactly 1.63 ppm. However, CH3Br is the closest, with a chemical shift of 6 ppm.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) CH3Br.\n\n(C) CH3Br\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation was helpful!",
