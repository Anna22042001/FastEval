Since the rectangle has vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$, we can see that $x$ can take values from 0 to 3, and $y$ can take values from 0 to 2.\n\nNext, let's count the number of possible points that satisfy the condition $x < y$. We can see that there are 2 points with $x = 0$ and $y = 1$ or $y = 2$, and there is 1 point with $x = 1$ and $y = 2$. So, the total number of possible points that satisfy the condition $x < y$ is 3.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of possible points that we can pick from the rectangle. We can see that there are 6 possible points with $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, 1, or 2, and there are 6 possible points with $x = 1$ and $y = 1$ or $y = 2$. So, the total number of possible points that we can pick from the rectangle is 12.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the probability that $x < y$ as follows:\n\nprobability = number of possible points that satisfy the condition $x < y$ / total number of possible points\n\nprobability = 3 / 12\n\nSo, the final answer is (C) \\frac{2}{3}.\n\n(C) \\frac{2}{3}",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer with factors of 16, 15, and 12, we can start by listing out all the factors of each number:\n\nFactors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\nFactors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15\nFactors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nNext, we can look for the smallest number that has at least one factor in common with each of the other numbers. In this case, the smallest number with a factor of 16 is 16 itself, the smallest number with a factor of 15 is 15 itself, and the smallest number with a factor of 12 is 12 itself.\n\nHowever, none of these numbers has factors in common with all three other numbers. To find the smallest number that has factors in common with all three other numbers, we need to look for the highest common factor (HCF) of 16, 15, and 12.\n\nThe HCF of two numbers can be found by dividing the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero. In this case, we can start by dividing 16 by 15:\n\n16 / 15 = 1 (remainder 1)\n15 / 15 = 1 (remainder 0)\n\nSo the HCF of 16 and 15 is 15. Next, we can divide 15 by 12:\n\n15 / 12 = 1 (remainder 3)\n12 / 12 = 1 (remainder 0)\n\nSo the HCF of 15 and 12 is 12. Therefore, the HCF of 16, 15, and 12 is 12.\n\nFinally, we can check that 12 has factors of 16, 15, and 12, which means that it is the smallest positive integer with factors of 16, 15, and 12.\n\nSo the answer is (C) 840.\n\n(C)",

If this pattern continues, what is the approximate population after 1 full day (24 hours)?\"\n\nTo answer this question, we can use the formula for exponential growth:\n\nP = P0 * (1 + r)^t\n\nwhere P is the final population, P0 is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time elapsed.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nP0 = 200 (initial population)\nr = 3/10 (growth rate)\nt = 24 (time elapsed)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nP = 200 * (1 + 3/10)^24\n\nWe can use a calculator to evaluate this expression:\n\nP = 200 * 27.93\nP = 5586\n\nSo, the approximate population after 1 full day is 5586.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) 2793.\n\n(D) 2793",

            "model_answer": "Alright, I will answer your question step-by-step:\n\n1. John had two piles of souvenir hat pins, and he divided them evenly. This means that the number of pins in each pile is the same. Let's call this number x.\n\n2. John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means that he gave him one-third of the pins in one of the piles, and then he halved that number. We can represent this as:\n\n(1/3 * x) / 2\n\n3. John had 66 pins left after giving his brother the pins. This means that the number of pins he gave his brother was 66 - x.\n\n4. We can set up an equation to represent the situation:\n\n(1/3 * x) / 2 = 66 - x\n\n5. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2 and 3:\n\n(1/3 * x) = 132 - 2x\n\n3x = 132 - 2x\n\n3x + 2x = 132\n\n5x = 132\n\nx = 26\n\n6. So, the number of pins in each pile was 26.\n\n7. Now, we can answer the question: How many pins did John originally have?\n\nSince there were two piles, and each pile had 26 pins, John originally had 26 * 2 = 52 pins.\n\nSo, the final answer is (D) 52.\n\n(D) 52",
