            "model_answer": "Sure, I can answer your question step-by-step. Here's my reasoning:\n\nTo begin with, the successor auditor needs to understand the reasons for the change of auditors. This is important to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest or other issues that could affect the new auditor's ability to perform the engagement. Therefore, the successor auditor should ask the predecessor auditor to provide the reasons for the change of auditors, as stated in option (B).\n\nNext, the successor auditor should ask the predecessor auditor to provide any disagreements that they may have had with management regarding significant accounting policies and principles. This information is important because it could have a significant impact on the new auditor's understanding of the company's financial statements. Therefore, the successor auditor should ask for this information, as stated in option (A).\n\nThe successor auditor should also ask the predecessor auditor to provide any facts that they may know about the integrity of management. This information is important because it could have a significant impact on the new auditor's ability to perform the engagement. Therefore, the successor auditor should ask for this information, as stated in option (C).\n\nFinally, the successor auditor should ask the predecessor auditor to provide information that could facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years. This information is important because it could have a significant impact on the new auditor's understanding of the company's financial statements. Therefore, the successor auditor should ask for this information, as stated in option (D).\n\nBased on this reasoning, I would say that the correct answer is (D).\n\n(D) Matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years.",

The segment's revenue should be 10% or more of the combined revenue of all operating segments.\n2. The segment's assets should be 10% or more of the combined assets of all operating segments.\n3. The segment's profit or loss should be a significant portion of the company's profit or loss.\n\nNow, let's apply these criteria to each of the segments:\n\nSegment A:\n\nRevenue: Segment A's revenue of $42 million is less than 10% of the combined revenue of all operating segments ($177 million), so it does not meet the first criterion.\n\nAssets: Segment A's assets of $470 million are more than 10% of the combined assets of all operating segments ($1350 million), so it meets the second criterion.\n\nProfit or Loss: Segment A's profit of $12 million is not a significant portion of the company's profit ($74 million), so it does not meet the third criterion.\n\nBased on these criteria, Segment A is not required to be separately disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nSegment B:\n\nRevenue: Segment B's revenue of $121 million is more than 10% of the combined revenue of all operating segments ($177 million), so it meets the first criterion.\n\nAssets: Segment B's assets of $800 million are more than 10% of the combined assets of all operating segments ($1350 million), so it meets the second criterion.\n\nProfit or Loss: Segment B's profit of $65 million is a significant portion of the company's profit ($74 million), so it meets the third criterion.\n\nBased on these criteria, Segment B is required to be separately disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nSegment C:\n\nRevenue: Segment C's revenue of $14 million is less than 10% of the combined revenue of all operating segments ($177 million), so it does not meet the first criterion.\n\nAssets: Segment C's assets of $80 million are less than 10% of the combined assets of all operating segments ($1350 million), so it does not meet the second criterion.\n\nProfit or Loss: Segment C's profit or loss of $(3) million is not a significant portion of the company's profit ($74 million), so it does not meet the third criterion.\n\nBased on these criteria, Segment C is not required to be separately disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is (B).

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can answer your question step-by-step. Here we go:\n\nFirst, I look at the question and break it down into its components:\n\n1. The question is asking about a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice.\n2. The question provides four options: (A) Acceptance of a client relationship, (B) Professional skepticism of management, (C) Computer information processing, and (D) Efficiency of organizational structures.\n\nNext, I review the options and eliminate the ones that are not related to a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice:\n\n1. (A) Acceptance of a client relationship: This option is not related to quality control policies and procedures, but rather to the initial stage of engagement between a CPA firm and a client.\n2. (D) Efficiency of organizational structures: This option is not related to quality control policies and procedures, but rather to the internal organization of the CPA firm.\n\nTherefore, the options that remain are (B) Professional skepticism of management and (C) Computer information processing.\n\nI then review these two options and determine which one is more directly related to a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice:\n\n1. (B) Professional skepticism of management: This option is related to the CPA firm's approach to auditing, which is an important aspect of quality control policies and procedures. Professional skepticism is an attitude of doubt that auditors should have when reviewing management's assertions and evidence. It is an essential part of the audit process and helps to ensure that the auditor's conclusions are based on objective evidence.\n2. (C) Computer information processing: This option is related to the use of computers in the CPA firm's auditing practice, but it is not directly related to quality control policies and procedures. While computer systems may be used to support the audit process, they are not a fundamental part of the quality control framework.\n\nBased on this analysis, I conclude that the correct answer is (B) Professional skepticism of management.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation was helpful!",

The $1000 check that was deposited on December 15 and included in the checkbook balance, but returned by the bank on December 30, should not be included in the balance sheet. However, the question states that the check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9, so we need to include it in the balance sheet.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of cash that Rune Co. should report on its December 31 balance sheet. The checkbook balance on December 31 was $10000, and the redeposited check for $1000 was cleared on January 9, so it should be included in the balance sheet.
