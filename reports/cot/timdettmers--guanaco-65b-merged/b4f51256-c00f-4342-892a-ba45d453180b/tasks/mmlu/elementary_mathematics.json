            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that! Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to estimate the product of 32 x 68. I can do this by rounding each number to the nearest ten. This gives me 30 x 70.\n\n2. Next, I need to calculate the product of 30 x 70. I can do this by multiplying the digits in each number together and adding a zero to the end: 3 x 7 = 21, so the product is 210.\n\n3. Now that I have the estimated product, I need to determine the range of numbers it falls between. I can do this by rounding the product to the nearest ten: 210 is between 200 and 300.\n\n4. Finally, I need to match the range to the answer options. The only option that falls within the range of 200 and 300 is (B) 180 and 280.\n\nSo my final answer is (B) 180 and 280.\n\n(B)",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that!\n\nTo write 4.95 as a mixed number or fraction in simplest form, I first need to identify the largest number that can be evenly divided by both 4 and 20. In this case, that number is 20.\n\nNext, I need to divide 4.95 by 20 to get the whole number and fractional part of the mixed number. Dividing 4.95 by 20 gives me a quotient of 0 with a remainder of 4.\n\nSo, the whole number part of the mixed number is 0, and the fractional part is 4/20.\n\nNow, I need to reduce the fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor. The greatest common factor of 4 and 20 is 4, so I can divide both numbers by 4 to get 1/5.\n\nFinally, the answer is (C) 4 and 1 over 20, which can be written as 4 1/5.\n\n(C) 4 and 1 over 20",
