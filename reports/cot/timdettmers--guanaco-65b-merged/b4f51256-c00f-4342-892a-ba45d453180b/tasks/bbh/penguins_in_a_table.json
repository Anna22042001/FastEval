There are four columns in the table, but only the first three columns (name, age, height) are relevant for this question. The last column (weight) is not relevant because it is not a species.\n\nI can see that there are four different names in the table: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. However, I need to be careful because some of these names may refer to the same species. For example, Louis and Bernard both have the same height (50 cm), which could indicate that they are the same species.\n\nTo determine if two penguins are the same species, I need to look at their age and height. If two penguins have the same age and height, they are likely the same species. However, if two penguins have different ages or heights, they are definitely different species.\n\nLouis and Bernard both have the same height (50 cm), but they have different ages (7 and 5 respectively). This means that they are definitely different species.\n\nVincent and Gwen also have different ages (9 and 8 respectively), so they are definitely different species.\n\nTherefore, there are four unique species in the table: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.\n\nThe final answer is (D) 4.",
