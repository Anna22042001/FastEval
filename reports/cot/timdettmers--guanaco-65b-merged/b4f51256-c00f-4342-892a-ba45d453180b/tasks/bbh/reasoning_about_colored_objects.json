The question states that there is a mauve sheet of paper on the desk. Mauve is a purple-like color, so I can eliminate options (A) to (O) and (Q) to (R) because they are not similar to mauve.\n\nNext, I will consider the other items on the desk. The turquoise pencil and the blue pen are similar in color, so I can eliminate option (K) (turquoise) and option (E) (blue). The grey paperclip and the pink textbook are also similar in color, so I can eliminate option (P) (grey) and option (R) (pink).\n\nFinally, I will look at the remaining options and choose the one that is the closest match to mauve. Out of the remaining options, (I) mauve is the only one that is exactly the same color as the sheet of paper.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (I) mauve.\n\n(I) mauve",
