            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the options step-by-step and analyze their relationship to the given situation:\n\n1. If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room, this is an example of an investment in fixed assets.\n\n2. Investment (I) is a component of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy over a specific period of time.\n\n3. When there is an increase in investment, it generally leads to an increase in GDP, as more resources are being allocated to productive activities.\n\n4. Therefore, option (B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases, is the most logical answer.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.",

This matches the given information, as the government is collecting more money in taxes than it spends.\n\n(C) a trade surplus: This term refers to a situation when a country exports more than it imports.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the \"crowding-out\" effect and then evaluate each option step by step.\n\nThe \"crowding-out\" effect is a phenomenon in which the government's borrowing to finance its budget deficit leads to higher interest rates, which in turn reduces private investment and consumption. This is because higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and individuals, leading them to cut back on investments and spending.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) decreasing interest rates from contractionary fiscal policy.\nThis option is incorrect because contractionary fiscal policy involves the government reducing its spending or increasing taxes, which would lead to a decrease in the budget deficit. This would not cause the crowding-out effect.\n\n(B) increasing interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy.\nThis option is also incorrect because expansionary fiscal policy involves the government increasing its spending or decreasing taxes, which would lead to an increase in the budget deficit. This would not cause the crowding-out effect.\n\n(C) increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy.\nThis option is not the correct answer either, as the crowding-out effect is related to fiscal policy, not monetary policy. Expansionary monetary policy involves central banks lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending, which is the opposite of the crowding-out effect.\n\n(D) increasing unemployment rates from expansionary monetary policy.\nThis option is also incorrect because it refers to unemployment rates, which are related to monetary policy, not fiscal policy. The crowding-out effect is caused by changes in interest rates resulting from fiscal policy.\n\nNone of the given options accurately describe the cause of the crowding-out effect.
