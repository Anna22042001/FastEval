Calculate the range of donations that includes 95% of the donations:\n   - Lower end: (mean - 1.96 * standard deviation)\n   - Upper end: (mean + 1.96 * standard deviation)\n\n3.

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the most likely statistic the teachers' union would quote during negotiations, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries: The mean is the average of all the values in a dataset. In this case, it would represent the average salary of all teachers and administrators. This statistic could be used to argue for a higher salary increase since it would show that the majority of staff members are currently earning below their desired salary.\n\n(B) The mode of all the salaries: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. In this context, it would represent the most common salary. Quoting the mode might not be as persuasive as the mean, as it doesn't provide information about the overall salary distribution.\n\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries: The standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean. In this case, it would show how much the salaries vary from the average. While it could be used to argue for a higher salary increase, it might not be as directly relevant to the negotiations as the mean.\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. It represents the salary at which 50% of the staff earn more and 50% earn less. This statistic could be used to argue for a higher salary increase, as it would show that a significant portion of the staff is currently earning below their desired salary.\n\nBased on this analysis, the teachers' union would most likely quote:\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",
