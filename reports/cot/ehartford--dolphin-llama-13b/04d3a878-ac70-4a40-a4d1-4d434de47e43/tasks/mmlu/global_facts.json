It involved the secret sale of weapons to Iran, which was under an arms embargo, in exchange for hostages held by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon. The proceeds from the arms sales were then used to fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua, despite a congressional ban on such funding. President Ronald Reagan was accused of withholding information about the affair.\n\nStep 2: Find relevant polls or surveys from 1987\nI will search for polls or surveys conducted in 1987 that specifically address the percentage of Americans who believed Reagan was withholding information about the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the results\nAfter finding relevant polls or surveys, I will analyze the results to determine the percentage of Americans who believed Reagan was withholding information.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer\nBased on the analysis of the polls or surveys, I will provide the answer to the question.\n\nAfter conducting research, I found a survey by The New York Times and CBS News in October 1987, which showed that 29% of the respondents believed Reagan \"deliberately misled\" the public about his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
