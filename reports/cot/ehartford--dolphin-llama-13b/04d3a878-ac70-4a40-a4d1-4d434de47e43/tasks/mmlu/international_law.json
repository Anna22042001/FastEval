Collective rights encompass more than just minority rights.\n\n(D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members - This option best defines collective rights, as it emphasizes that collective rights involve both the group as a whole and the individual members of the group.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members.",
