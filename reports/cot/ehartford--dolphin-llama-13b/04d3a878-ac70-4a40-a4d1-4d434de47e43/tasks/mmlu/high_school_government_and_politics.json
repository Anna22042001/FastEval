Appellate judges do consider previous court decisions, so this option is not true.\n\nOption B: Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\n- Appellate trials do not involve juries, as they are focused on reviewing the decisions made by lower courts. This option is not true.\n\nOption C: Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\n- Appellate judges do not re-examine the facts of a case, but rather review the legal decisions made by lower courts. This option is not true.\n\nOption D: Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n- Appellate judges do review the decisions made by lower courts to determine if any legal errors were made. This option is true.\n\nStep 3: Output the answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n1. Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248: These are historical documents that took place in 1939. They were signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and aimed at reorganizing the U.S. government to improve efficiency and streamline operations.\n\n2. (A) Peace Corps: The Peace Corps is an international volunteer program founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. It is not related to the Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 or Executive Order 8248.\n\n3. (B) White House Office: The White House Office is a general term for various departments within the White House that assist the President in carrying out their duties. While the Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248 may have affected the staffing of some White House offices, they were not specifically designed for that purpose.\n\n4. (C) Senate Committee on Appropriations: This is a committee within the U.S. Senate that deals with budgetary and financial matters. It is not directly related to the Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 or Executive Order 8248.\n\n5. (D) Cabinet: The Cabinet is a group of high-ranking officials appointed by the President to advise them on various matters related to their executive responsibilities. The Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248 both deal with the organization and responsibilities of the President's staff, making the Cabinet the most relevant option.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Cabinet",

Ferguson decision: This case occurred in 1896 and dealt with the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in public education. It did not overturn the Dred Scott decision.\n\n(B) Missouri Compromise: This was a law passed in 1820 that temporarily resolved the issue of slavery in newly admitted states. It did not overturn the Dred Scott decision.\n\n(C) Jim Crow laws: These were a series of laws enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that legalized and enforced segregation between white and black Americans. They did not overturn the Dred Scott decision.\n\n(D) Fourteenth Amendment: This amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1868 and addressed citizenship and equal protection under the law. It directly overturned the Dred Scott decision by granting citizenship to former slaves and establishing that the government could not deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Fourteenth Amendment",
