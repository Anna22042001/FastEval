            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Quiet inspiration refers to the process of inhaling air without making any noise.\n2. During quiet inspiration, the air is drawn into the lungs, and the volume of the thoracic cavity increases.\n3. The muscles involved in this process are those that help expand the thoracic cavity and create a negative pressure inside it, allowing air to flow in.\n4. The main muscles responsible for this are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles.\n5. The diaphragm is the primary muscle responsible for the expansion of the thoracic cavity during inspiration.\n6. The intercostal muscles, which are located between the ribs, also play a role in expanding the thoracic cavity during inspiration.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm",

It is responsible for protecting the spinal cord, which is a bundle of nerves that transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body.\n\nConsidering the function and location of the spinal canal, it is clear that it is not located in the tail (caudal), back (dorsal), or front (frontal) parts of the body.
