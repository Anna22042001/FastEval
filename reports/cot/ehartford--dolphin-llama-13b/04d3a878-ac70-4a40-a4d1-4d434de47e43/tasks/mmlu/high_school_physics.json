            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each statement step-by-step:\n\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is not true because the ball has an initial potential energy due to its height, and as it falls back down, it converts potential energy into kinetic energy, causing the ball to gain speed.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is also not true because the ball experiences a force due to gravity, causing it to accelerate. At the highest point, the acceleration is not zero, as the ball is still being pulled downwards by gravity.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThis statement is true because, on average, it takes the same amount of time for the ball to travel from the highest point to the ground as it did to reach the highest point. This is due to the conservation of energy, where the potential energy at the highest point is converted into kinetic energy as it falls back down.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) I & III only",
