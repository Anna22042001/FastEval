Using a logarithmic functional form might help to better capture the relationship between the variables, but it does not directly address the issue of non-normality.\n\n(B) Add lags of the variables on the right hand side of the regression model: Adding lags of the variables does not address the issue of residual non-normality. It might help to improve the model's fit, but it is not a direct solution to the problem.\n\n(C) Estimate the model in first differenced form: Estimating the model in first differenced form can help to address the issue of residual non-normality. By differencing the variables, the model becomes less sensitive to outliers and the assumption of normality is less critical. This option seems more plausible than the others.\n\n(D) Remove any large outliers from the data: Removing large outliers can improve the model's fit and might help to address residual non-normality.

It is often used in forecasting and trading rule profitability. So, this statement could be true.\n\n(B) Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function\n- Mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. It does not involve squaring the differences, and it is not directly related to a quadratic loss function. So, this statement is not true.\n\n(C) Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts\n- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, expressed as a percentage of the actual values. It is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts. So, this statement is true.\n\n(D) Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors\n- Mean squared error (MSE) penalizes the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n(ii) The significance level is equal to the power of the test\n- The power of the test refers to the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
