            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) decreasing salt retention: Salt retention is not directly related to the body's response to increased environmental temperature.\n\n(B) increasing respiration rate: When the environment is hotter, our body needs to cool itself down. One way to do this is by increasing the respiration rate, which helps release heat through the process of respiration.\n\n(C) increasing heart rate: An increased heart rate can also help release heat by increasing blood flow to the skin and extremities, which can then dissipate heat more effectively.\n\n(D) increasing water lost through skin: While sweating can help cool the body down, it is not the only mechanism the body uses to compensate for increased environmental temperature.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) increasing respiration rate and (C) increasing heart rate",

This process occurs in the kidneys.\n\n(B) Conversion to glucose in the heart: The heart is not involved in the metabolism of lactate. Glucose production and conversion occur in other organs, such as the liver.\n\n(C) Excretion via the kidneys: Lactate is transported to the kidneys via the bloodstream, where it is converted to urea and excreted in the urine. This is the correct answer.\n\n(D) Uptake and oxidation by other tissues: While other tissues may utilize lactate as an energy source, the primary fate of lactate leaving the muscle and entering the circulation is excretion via the kidneys.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(C) excretion via the kidneys.",

So, this option is also incorrect.\n\n(C) in the nucleus: This is the correct location for transcription, as it is where DNA is stored and where RNA polymerase binds to the DNA to initiate transcription.\n\n(D) only during cell division: Transcription occurs continuously, not only during cell division.

This is because the structure of DNA is fixed and the ratio is consistent across all DNA molecules.\n\n(B) determined by the base sequence in RNA: RNA is single-stranded and its base sequence is complementary to the DNA template. However, RNA is not involved in determining the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA.\n\n(C) genetically determined: The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is not determined by genetics. This is because the DNA molecule's structure is fixed and does not change during the organism's life.\n\n(D) always 1:1: In a double-stranded DNA molecule, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is approximately 1:1. This means that for every adenine (A) or guanine (G) there is a cytosine (C) or thymine (T), respectively.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) always 1:1.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each molecule step by step and determine which one will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.\n\n(A) Oxaloacetate: This molecule is involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle), which is an anaerobic process, meaning it can occur without oxygen. Therefore, Oxaloacetate production will continue even without oxygen.\n\n(B) Pyruvate: Pyruvate is also involved in the citric acid cycle. It is the primary entry point for oxygen consumption in cellular respiration. Without oxygen, pyruvate cannot be further processed into Acetyl-CoA, which is necessary for the citric acid cycle to continue.\n\n(C) Water: Water is not a molecule produced during cellular respiration. It is a byproduct of the process. Therefore, its production will not be affected by the lack of oxygen.\n\n(D) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP): ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell and is produced during cellular respiration. However, the production of ATP is not directly dependent on oxygen. In fact, the anaerobic process of cellular respiration (without oxygen) produces lactic acid, while the aerobic process (with oxygen) produces a larger amount of ATP.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is:\n\n(B) Pyruvate",

It is not primarily involved in buffering intracellular pH changes.\n\n(B) Glucose: Glucose is a simple sugar that serves as the primary energy source for cells during cellular respiration. It does not directly act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes.\n\n(C) Carnosine: Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of beta-alanine and histidine. It acts as an intracellular buffer, helping to maintain the pH of the cell by accepting and donating protons, thus preventing large pH changes.\n\n(D) Amylase: Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose, which can then be further broken down into glucose.
