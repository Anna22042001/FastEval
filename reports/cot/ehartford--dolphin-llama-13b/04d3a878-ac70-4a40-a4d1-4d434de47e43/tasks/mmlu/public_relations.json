            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each form of communication and its effectiveness in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue.\n\n(A) Interpersonal communication involves face-to-face or verbal communication between individuals. It allows for direct interaction, immediate feedback, and the ability to clarify misunderstandings. This form of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, as it allows for personal connections and the sharing of experiences.\n\n(B) Media communication includes various forms of non-verbal communication, such as newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and the internet. Media can reach a large audience and provide information and perspectives on an issue. However, it may not be as effective in forming or changing predispositions, as it lacks the personal interaction and immediate feedback that interpersonal communication provides.\n\n(C) Group communication involves individuals discussing an issue within a smaller setting, such as a team or committee. This form of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions, as it allows for direct interaction, shared experiences, and the opportunity for members to influence each other's opinions.\n\n(D) Public communication refers to communication aimed at a large audience, such as speeches, advertisements, or public events. Public communication can raise awareness about an issue and present different perspectives, but it may not be as effective in forming or changing predispositions as interpersonal or group communication, due to the lack of personal interaction and immediate feedback.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is:\n\n(A) Interpersonal",
