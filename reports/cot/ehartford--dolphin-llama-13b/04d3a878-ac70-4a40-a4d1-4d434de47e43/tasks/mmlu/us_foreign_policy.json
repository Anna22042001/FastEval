            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n\nReasoning:\nInternational trade can benefit both countries, but it can also lead to certain costs being concentrated in specific areas or industries. When a country protects its firms from exposure to the world market, it is trying to mitigate the negative impacts of these concentrated costs. By doing so, the country can still enjoy the benefits of international trade while minimizing the potential harm to certain domestic industries.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the phrase \"empire by invitation\" and analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n(A) Voluntary reliance on an external power for security: This option suggests that a country willingly depends on another country's military power to ensure its safety. While this could be related to the concept of an \"empire,\" it doesn't fully capture the idea of an \"invitation.\"\n\n(B) Willful openness to colonization: This option implies that a country actively seeks to be colonized by another country, which could lead to the formation of an empire. However, the term \"invitation\" doesn't seem to fit in this context.\n\n(C) Cultural imperialism: This option refers to the spread of a culture or ideas from one country to another, often through force or influence. While this can be related to the concept of an \"empire,\" it doesn't directly address the idea of an \"invitation.\"\n\n(D) Open advocacy of imperialism for economic gain: This option suggests that a country openly supports imperialism, or the expansion of its power and influence, for the purpose of gaining economic benefits. This option seems to best capture the idea of an \"empire\" and the concept of an \"invitation.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(D) Open advocacy of imperialism for economic gain",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States: This option does not directly explain how World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States. Population levels do not necessarily determine economic power.\n\n(B) The United States seized German resources after the war: While the United States did gain some resources from Germany after World War I, this option does not fully explain the shift in economic power from Europe to the United States.\n\n(C) European countries paid the United States for assistance: This option is partially correct, as European countries did pay the United States for assistance during World War I. However, this option does not fully explain the shift in economic power from Europe to the United States.\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy: This option best explains the shift in economic power from Europe to the United States. During World War I, the United States provided financial and material support to European countries fighting in the war. As a result, the US economy grew, and the United States became a creditor nation, further strengthening its economic power.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.",

US foreign policy must adhere to international law, and it can be a constraint on decision making.\n\n(C) Intergovernmental organizations: Organizations like the United Nations, NATO, and the World Trade Organization can have an impact on US foreign policy decisions. These organizations often set rules and guidelines that the US must follow.\n\nNow that we have analyzed each option, we can conclude that:\n\n(D) All of the above\n\nare possible constraints on US foreign policy decision making.",

These factors can significantly influence the U.S. foreign policy behavior.\n\n(C) The President's individual personality: While the President's personality can play a role in shaping their approach to foreign policy, it is not the only factor to consider.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each mechanism step by step:\n\n(A) Reciprocity across multiple issues: Global and regional international trade agreements often involve reciprocity, which means that countries agree to treat each other's goods and services similarly in terms of tariffs and other trade barriers. This helps promote trade between the countries involved.\n\n(B) Reputational concerns of the actors: Reputational concerns can play a role in international trade agreements, as countries may want to maintain a positive image among other countries and international organizations. This can lead to cooperation and adherence to the agreements.\n\n(C) Side payments for adjusting to the organization: While side payments can be part of some international trade agreements, they are not a primary mechanism used in global and regional trade agreements. The Common Agricultural Policy in the EU is an example of a side payment system, but it is not representative of all international trade agreements.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) ALL of the above",

These options suggest that Reagan's military spending, diplomacy, and reduced military spending allowed the Soviet Union to eventually collapse, thus ending the Cold War.\n\nSo, the answer is: (A) Reagan's first term military spending pressured the Soviet Union to keep up its international commitments, (B) Reagan encouraged engagement with the Soviet Union, and (D) Reagan reduced military spending and this allowed the Soviet Union space to reform.",
