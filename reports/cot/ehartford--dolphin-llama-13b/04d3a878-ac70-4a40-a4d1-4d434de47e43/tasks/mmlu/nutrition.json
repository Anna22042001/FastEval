Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations",

            "model_answer": "(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nReasoning:\n\n(A) Replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to lower plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because n-6 polyunsaturated fats have a more favorable effect on lipid metabolism compared to saturated fats.\n\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is not associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. Monounsaturated fats have a neutral effect on LDL cholesterol levels.\n\n(C) Consuming soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. This is because these compounds can help lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by reducing its absorption in the bloodstream.\n\n(D) Replacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is not associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations. Carbohydrates do not have the same effect on lipid metabolism as fats, and replacing saturated fats with carbohydrates may not necessarily lead to the desired outcome.",

However, the question asks for the one that may be required in greater amounts than can readily be synthesized in the body under stress.\n\nStep 4: Consider the role of each amino acid in stress response\nDuring stress, the body may prioritize the synthesis of certain essential amino acids to meet its energy and structural needs. In this case, Alanine (B) is the amino acid that can be used as a source of energy through the process of transamination, where it is converted into Glutamate (A). This conversion requires additional energy and may not be sufficient to meet the increased demand for Glutamate (A) during stress.\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is:\n\n(B) Alanine",
