We know that Weber identified three types of social actions: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, and traditional.\n3. We need to find the type that best fits the description of the fourth ideal type.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) affectual - This option is not commonly associated with Weber's ideal types of social actions.\n(B) affective - This option is not a commonly used term in the context of Weber's ideal types.\n(C) effective - This option does not fit the context of Weber's ideal types, as it is an adjective rather than a type of social action.\n(D) infected - This option is not related to Weber's ideal types of social actions.\n\nNone of the given options (A, B, C, or D) seem to fit the description of the fourth ideal type of social action that Weber identified.

According to recent studies, cannabis is the most commonly used drug.\n\n(C) teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys\n- There is no clear evidence to support this statement.
