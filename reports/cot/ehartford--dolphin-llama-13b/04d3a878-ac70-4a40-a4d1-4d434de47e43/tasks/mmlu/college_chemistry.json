            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is incorrect. Optical isomerism can occur in square planar complexes even if the ligands are not identical.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is also incorrect. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands have different orientation around the central metal atom.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is true. In linear complexes, optical isomerism occurs when the ligands have different spatial arrangements around the central metal atom.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is incorrect. Octahedral complexes can display optical isomerism even if they have fewer than three different ligands, as long as the ligands have different spatial arrangements around the central metal atom.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.",
