Option (B) suggests that expediency is in accord with Nature, but immorality is repugnant to Nature. Option (C) is the opposite of option (B), stating that immorality is in accord with Nature, but expediency is repugnant to Nature. Option (D) states that both immorality and expediency are in accord with Nature.\n\nBased on Cicero's views, immorality goes against the principles of nature, while expediency is in accordance with nature. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) repugnant to Nature; in accord with Nature.",

According to Kant, the supreme principle of morality is the Categorical Imperative. The Categorical Imperative states that one should always act in a way that they would want their actions to be universal law. This principle is derived from reason and is considered a priori, meaning it is true by definition and can be known without empirical experience.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Synthetic and a priori.",

However, Epictetus' teachings focus on self-control and rationality, so this option is unlikely.\n\nOption B: Moderate grief - This option implies that the virtuous man would feel sad about the loss of his family, but would still maintain self-control and rationality. This option aligns more with Epictetus' teachings.\n\nOption C: Undisturbed - This option suggests that the virtuous man would remain calm and unaffected by the loss of his family. This option also aligns with Epictetus' teachings of self-control and rationality.\n\nOption D: Envy of those who still have their loved ones - This option implies that the virtuous man would feel jealous of others who still have their families. This option contradicts Epictetus' teachings, as it involves negative emotions and a lack of self-control.\n\nStep 4: Determine the most appropriate answer based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(C) undisturbed.",

Baier's theory is about the individual's moral assessment, so this option also doesn't align with the theory.\n\n(C) whether it is forbidden by a law.\nThis option focuses on legal prohibition. Baier's theory is about moral assessment, not legal consequences. Therefore, this option doesn't align with the theory.\n\n(D) whether one can approve of it.\nThis option focuses on the individual's personal moral assessment. It aligns with Baier's theory, which is about how an individual assesses the morality of an action.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) whether one can approve of it.",

This option seems plausible.\n\n(B) a continual progress of desire from one object to another: This option does not align with Hobbes' ideas. In his view, desires should be controlled and directed towards common goals established by the social contract.\n\n(C) a state of contemplation: Hobbes did not emphasize contemplation as a source of felicity. Instead, he focused on the need for order and stability to achieve happiness.\n\n(D) the absence of desire: Hobbes did not advocate for the complete absence of desire.
