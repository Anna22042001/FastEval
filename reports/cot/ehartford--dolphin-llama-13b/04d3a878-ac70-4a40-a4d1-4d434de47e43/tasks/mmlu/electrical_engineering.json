Non-magnetic materials do not interact with the magnetic field, so they are not involved in the heating process. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n(B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.\nInduction heating works by creating an electromagnetic field that induces a current in conducting materials. This option is correct because it includes both magnetic and non-magnetic conducting materials in the heating process.\n\n(C) insulating materials.\nInsulating materials are not conductive and do not allow the flow of electric current. Therefore, they are not involved in induction heating. This option is incorrect.\n\n(D) conducting and magnetic materials.\nThis option is similar to option (B), but it specifically mentions magnetic materials. However, induction heating also works with non-magnetic conducting materials. Therefore, this option is not as accurate as option (B).\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.",
