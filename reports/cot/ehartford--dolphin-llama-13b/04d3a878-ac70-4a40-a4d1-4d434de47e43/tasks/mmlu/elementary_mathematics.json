            "model_answer": "First, let's break down the given expression step-by-step:\n\n1. We have to write 8 and 2 over 4 as an improper fraction in simplest form.\n2. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 2, and 4.\n3. The LCM of 8, 2, and 4 is 16.\n4. Now, we need to find the simplest form of 8 and 2 in terms of 16.\n5. 8 is already in the simplest form as 2^3.\n6. 2 can be written as 2^1, which is 2 raised to the power of 1.\n7. Now, we need to write the expression as an improper fraction using the simplest form of 8 and 2 in terms of 16.\n8. The simplest form of 8 in terms of 16 is 2^3, and the simplest form of 2 in terms of 16 is 2^1.\n9. So, the improper fraction is (2^3) / (2^1) = 2^2 / 2.\n\nNow, let's simplify the improper fraction:\n\n10. 2^2 = 4, so the improper fraction becomes 4 / 1.\n\n11. Finally, we need to simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 4 and 1 is 4.\n12. 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 1 divided by 4 is 1/4.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) 17 over 4",
