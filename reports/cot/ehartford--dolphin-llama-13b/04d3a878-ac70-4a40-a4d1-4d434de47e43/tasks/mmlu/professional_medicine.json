            "question": "A 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination. The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient has active ankylosing spondylitis, which is an autoimmune disease.\n2. Conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been ineffective for this patient.\n3. Sulfasalazine treatment has also not improved the patient's condition.\n4. We need to find the drug that inhibits a specific factor involved in the inflammatory process.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 - This is related to the immune system, but not the primary target for inhibiting inflammation in ankylosing spondylitis.\n(B) Epidermal growth factor - This is involved in cell growth and regeneration, not inflammation.\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1) - This is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the inflammatory process.\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 - This is another cytokine involved in the immune response, but it is primarily associated with rheumatoid arthritis and not ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the most appropriate next step in treatment for the patient with ankylosing spondylitis is the administration of a drug that inhibits:\n\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)",

Her blood pressure readings show discrepancies between her right and left arms, and between supine and standing positions.
