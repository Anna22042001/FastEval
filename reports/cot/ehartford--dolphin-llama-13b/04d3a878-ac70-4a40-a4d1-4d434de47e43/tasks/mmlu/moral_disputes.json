            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first analyze Philippa Foot's argument about the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction.\n\nPhilippa Foot argues that there is a moral difference between killing someone and letting them die. She believes that the former is always wrong, while the latter may be justifiable in certain circumstances.\n\nNow, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) Rights of noninterference: This option suggests that individuals have a right to be free from interference in their lives. However, this does not directly address the moral distinction between killing and letting die.\n\n(B) Rights to goods and services: This option refers to the idea that individuals have a right to access basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. While this is an important moral consideration, it does not directly address the killing/letting die distinction.\n\n(C) Both A and B: Combining the ideas of rights of noninterference and rights to goods and services does not directly address the moral distinction between killing and letting die.\n\n(D) Neither A nor B: This option suggests that neither of the other options directly address the moral distinction between killing and letting die.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Neither A nor B",
