            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity: This statement is incorrect. According to general relativity, gravity causes light to bend, but it does not slow it down.\n\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected: This statement is also incorrect. While gravity does cause light to bend near massive objects like the Sun, it does not cause a significant deflection of light.\n\n(C) A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth: This statement is correct. According to general relativity, time dilation occurs near massive objects due to the curvature of spacetime. This means that time passes slightly faster near the Sun than on Earth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) All of these.",

Beta decay occurs when an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting a beta particle.\n3. A beta particle is either an electron or a positron (its antimatter counterpart).\n4. When an electron is emitted, the atomic number of the element decreases by 1, as the number of protons remains the same.\n5. When a positron is emitted, the atomic number of the element increases by 1, as the number of protons increases by 1.\n\nNow, we can determine the correct answer based on the given options:\n\n(A) reduces by 1 - This is correct when an electron is emitted.\n(B) increases by 1 - This is correct when a positron is emitted.\n(C) reduces by 2 - This is incorrect, as beta particles do not reduce the atomic number by 2.\n(D) increases by 2 - This is incorrect, as beta particles do not increase the atomic number by 2.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(A) reduces by 1",

When these colors mix, they create secondary colors. For example, red and blue mix to create purple, and blue and green mix to create cyan.\n\nStep 3: Consider the color of rose petals\nRose petals are typically red, pink, or white. In this case, we are considering red petals.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the color-mixing properties of red petals\nRed petals contain pigments that absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others. When these pigments absorb light, they create the color we perceive.\n\nStep 5: Determine the color of light reflected by red petals\nRed petals primarily reflect light in the red part of the spectrum. This means that the color of light we see when looking at red petals is mainly due to the red wavelengths of light being reflected.\n\nStep 6: Match the answer to the given options\n(A) red - This option matches the reasoning above, as the color of light we see when looking at red petals is primarily red.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) red.",

Satellites in circular Earth orbit maintain a constant speed because they are continuously falling towards Earth due to gravity.\n2. However, their speed is also constantly pushing them away from Earth, so they never fall onto the surface.\n3. The force of gravity pulling the satellite towards Earth is equal to the force of the satellite moving away from Earth, which is known as centripetal force.\n4. Centripetal force is directed towards the center of the circle (Earth), and it is what keeps the satellite moving in a circular path.\n5. The gravitational force on the satellite is not zero, as it is constantly falling towards Earth.\n6. The force is also not practically zero, as it is strong enough to keep the satellite in orbit.\n7. The force is not appreciably weaker than at Earth's surface, as the gravitational force is the same everywhere on Earth for an object in free fall.\n8. The force is not without a component along their circular path, as the centripetal force is directed towards the center of the circle (Earth).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) without a component of force along their circular path",
