            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to find the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year.\n\nStep 1: Research the number of people living in the United States.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 331 million people living in the United States in 2021.\n\nStep 2: Research the average number of movies watched per person per year.\nAccording to a report by the MPAA, the average U.S. consumer watched about 5 movies in theaters and 9 movies via streaming services in 2019. This adds up to about 14 movies per person per year.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year.\nMultiply the number of people living in the United States (331 million) by the average number of movies watched per person per year (14).\n\n331,000,000 * 14 = 4,497,000,000\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) 20,000,000,000",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the amount of ice wasted by Americans each year.\n2. Calculate the amount of energy required to produce that amount of ice.\n3. Compare the energy required to produce the ice with the energy wasted.\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of ice wasted by Americans each year.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the average American uses about 40 gallons of bottled water per year, which is approximately 700 ounces. Assuming that each person drinks about one 16-ounce beverage per day, they would consume about 5.5 ounces of ice per day. Over the course of a year, this would amount to 5.5 ounces/day * 365 days/year = 196.5 ounces/year.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the amount of energy required to produce that amount of ice.\nAssuming an average energy consumption of 0.2 kWh/gallon for bottled water production, we can calculate the energy required to produce 196.5 ounces of ice:\n196.5 ounces / 0.2 kWh/gallon = 982.5 kWh.\n\nStep 3: Compare the energy required to produce the ice with the energy wasted.\nThe energy wasted is equal to the energy required to produce the ice, as there is no mention of any energy-saving practices in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) 6*10^11 J",
