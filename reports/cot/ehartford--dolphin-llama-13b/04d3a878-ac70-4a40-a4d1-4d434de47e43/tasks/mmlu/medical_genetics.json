            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The question is about genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and how well known SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) explain the variation in body mass index (BMI).\n2. The question provides information that there is evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies.\n3. We need to find the percentage of variation in BMI explained by known SNPs in GWAS.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n\n(A) only 5% - This option is unlikely, as it is too low of a percentage to represent \"greater than 50% heritability\" from twin and family studies.\n\n(B) less than 1% - This option is also unlikely, as it is too low to represent a significant portion of the heritability.\n\n(C) only 13% - This option is possible, as it is a moderate percentage that could represent a portion of the heritability that is not fully accounted for by known SNPs.\n\n(D) less than 2% - This option is also possible, as it is another moderate percentage that could represent a portion of the heritability that is not fully accounted for by known SNPs.\n\nBased on the information provided and the analysis of the answer choices, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n(C) only 13%",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n2. This deficiency results in high levels of phenylalanine, an amino acid, in the body.\n3. If a child inherits the PKU gene from both parents, they will have the disorder.\n4. If a child inherits only one PKU gene, they are a carrier of the disorder but do not have the disease themselves.\n5. If a child does not inherit any PKU genes, they will not have the disorder or be a carrier.\n\nNow, let's analyze the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU:\n\n- If the child inherits two PKU genes (one from mother and one from father), they will have the disorder.\n- If the child inherits only one PKU gene (from mother), they will be a carrier but not have the disorder themselves.\n- If the child does not inherit any PKU genes, they will not have the disorder or be a carrier.\n\nConsidering these possibilities, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is:\n\n(D) Almost 100%",

Inbreeding coefficient is a measure of the degree of gene flow between individuals in a population that are related. A higher inbreeding coefficient indicates a higher probability of mating between closely related individuals.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option to determine its relationship with the inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population: Heterozygotes are individuals with two different alleles at a particular gene. Inbreeding increases the chances of mating between closely related individuals, which can lead to the expression of both alleles in offspring. This option is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(B) Higher proportion of genes that show linkage: Linkage refers to the close association of genes on the same chromosome. Inbreeding increases the chances of gene linkage, as closely related individuals are more likely to inherit the same combination of genes. This option is related to the inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(C) Higher proportion of genes with introns: Introns are non-coding regions of DNA within a gene. The presence of introns is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(D) Higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: The difference between RNA molecules in daughter cells is related to the process of transcription and not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient.\n\nStep 4: Determine the best answer based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best answer is:\n\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage",
