How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question - The question asks how two stars with a small angular separation will appear to our eyes if their separation is smaller than our eyes' angular resolution.\n\nStep 2: Recall the definition of angular separation - Angular separation is the angle between two objects in the sky, like stars. In this case, the two stars have a small angular separation.\n\nStep 3: Recall the definition of angular resolution - Angular resolution is the smallest angle that our eyes can distinguish. If the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution, the two stars will appear to be closer together than they actually are.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer choices:\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all - This is incorrect because the stars are already there, and our eyes can see them.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars - This is incorrect because the small angular separation will make the stars appear closer together than they are.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light - This is correct because the small angular separation will make the stars appear as one point of light to our eyes.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell - This is incorrect because the stars will appear as one point of light, not as a dumbbell.\n\nFinal answer: (C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what bolometric luminosity is and then evaluate each option step by step.\n\nBolometric luminosity is the total energy output of a star, including all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. It is a measure of a star's luminosity over a wide range of wavelengths.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) The luminosity integrated over vertically polarized wavelengths.\nThis option is incorrect because it only considers a specific polarization of the electromagnetic spectrum, not all wavelengths.\n\n(B) The luminosity integrated over horizontally wavelengths.\nThis option is also incorrect for the same reason as option (A), as it only considers a specific polarization of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n(C) The luminosity integrated over visible wavelengths.\nThis option is incorrect because it only considers a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, not all wavelengths.\n\n(D) The luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.\nThis option is correct because it considers the total energy output of a star across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) The luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.",
