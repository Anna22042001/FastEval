Calculate the new date: We need to find the date 24 hours later from 05/31/1943. To do this, we can add 24 hours to the original date.\n\n3. Convert hours to days: Since we are adding 24 hours to the original date, we need to convert hours to days. There are 24 hours in a day, so adding 24 hours is equivalent to adding one day.\n\n4. Add days to the original date: Now, we add one day to 05/31/1943, which gives us 06/01/1943.\n\n5. Convert the new date to MM/DD/YYYY format: The new date is 06/01/1943.
