This seems plausible, as even a small wobble may not necessarily pose a significant risk.\n\nStatement (B) implies that a wheel wobbling several feet in either direction is not enough to suggest that the bike is unsafe.

It seems to be expressing skepticism or doubt about the idea.\n\n(B) How could Government control of the internet be beneficial?\nThis statement is also asking a question, but it is expressing the opposite sentiment.
