The purpose of an audit is to obtain reasonable assurance about the fairness of the presentation of financial statements.\n\nOption A asks for disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management, which could potentially impact the fairness of the financial statements. This information would be important for the successor auditor to understand the reasoning behind any significant accounting policies and principles.\n\nOption B asks about the predecessor auditor\u2019s understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors. While this information might be interesting, it is not directly related to the purpose of an audit.\n\nOption C asks for facts known to the predecessor auditor that might bear on the integrity of management. This information could potentially impact the fairness of the financial statements, and therefore, it is important for the successor auditor to consider.\n\nOption D asks for matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years.

            "model_answer": "To determine which segments are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements, we need to refer to the accounting standards for segment reporting. According to those standards, a company is required to disclose separate financial information for each reportable segment if the segment meets either of the following criteria:\n\n1. The segment's revenue represents 10% or more of the company's total revenue.\n2. The segment's assets represent 10% or more of the company's total assets.\n\nLet's analyze each segment's revenue and assets to determine if any of them meet the criteria for separate disclosure:\n\nSegment A:\nRevenue: $42,000 (11.11% of total revenue)\nAssets: $470,000 (9.09% of total assets)\n\nSegment B:\nRevenue: $121,000 (29.63% of total revenue)\nAssets: $800,000 (15.15% of total assets)\n\nSegment C:\nRevenue: $14,000 (3.53% of total revenue)\nAssets: $80,000 (1.47% of total assets)\n\nBased on the information provided, Segment B meets both criteria for separate disclosure since its revenue represents more than 10% of the company's total revenue, and its assets represent more than 10% of the company's total assets. Therefore, Segment B must be disclosed separately in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements.\n\nSince Segment B meets the criteria for separate disclosure, we do not need to analyze the other segments further. The answer to the question is (B) A and C only.",

We need to determine which statement is correct.\n\nStep 2: Consider the options\n\nOption A: Is absolute.\nThis option suggests that a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is absolute, meaning it is always available and cannot be limited or conditioned in any way.\n\nOption B: Is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock.\nThis option suggests that a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock. This means that a shareholder who does not own this amount of stock would not have the right to inspect the records.\n\nOption C: Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.\nThis option suggests that a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose. This means that a shareholder who demands to inspect the records but does not have a proper purpose for doing so may not be allowed to inspect the records.\n\nOption D: Exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged.\nThis option suggests that a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records exists only when fraud or illegality is alleged. This means that a shareholder who does not allege fraud or illegality may not have the right to inspect the records.\n\nStep 3: Determine the correct answer\n\nThe correct statement regarding a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is option C: Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose. This is because the right to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute and can be limited by the corporation if the demand to inspect is not for a proper purpose. Owning a certain amount of stock or alleging fraud or illegality are not conditions that automatically grant a shareholder the right to inspect the records.",

The land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage, which was assumed by Ace Partnership.\n3. No other liabilities existed at the time of the contribution.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the fair market value of the land contributed by Strom to Ace Partnership.

The mortgage of $24,000 is a liability that reduces the basis of the land contributed. Therefore, the adjusted basis of the land contributed to Ace Partnership is the sum of the fair market value of the land ($12,500) and the mortgage assumed ($24,000), which is $36,500.\n\nSince Strom contributed 25% of Ace Partnership, Strom's basis in Ace Partnership is 25% of $36,500, which is $9,125.
