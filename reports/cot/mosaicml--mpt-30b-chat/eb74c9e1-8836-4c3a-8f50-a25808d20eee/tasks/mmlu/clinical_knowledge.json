            "model_answer": "Between contractions of the left ventricle, the blood continues to flow through the vessels because of option D, the arteries have elastic recoil.\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. During a contraction of the left ventricle, blood is pumped out of the heart and into the aorta, which is the main artery that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\n2. After the left ventricle contracts, it relaxes and refills with blood. During this time, the arteries have elastic recoil, which means they can expand and contract to help push blood through the body.\n3. The atria, which are the two upper chambers of the heart, are responsible for pumping blood into the ventricles. However, they do not have as much force as the ventricles, so they cannot push blood through the vessels on their own.\n4. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. It does not play a role in pumping blood to the rest of the body.\n5. Therefore, between contractions of the left ventricle, the blood continues to flow through the vessels because the arteries have elastic recoil, which helps to keep the blood moving.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: To determine which of the options is true of Graves Disease of the thyroid, we need to understand what Graves Disease is and its symptoms.\n\nGraves Disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, which is an overactive thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck, and it produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Ophthalmoplegia is a medical term that refers to weakness or paralysis of the muscles that control eye movement. This can be a symptom of Graves Disease, but it is not exclusive to it. Therefore, option (A) is partially true.\n\n(B) A multi-nodular goitre is a condition where the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and has multiple lumps or nodules. This is not necessarily related to Graves Disease, as the two conditions can exist independently. Therefore, option (B) is false.\n\n(C) Graves Disease is actually more common in females than males. The ratio is about 8:1, with females being more affected. Therefore, option (C) is false.\n\n(D) In the past, Graves Disease was sometimes referred to as \"Derbyshire Neck\" due to the swelling of the thyroid gland causing a visible bulge in the neck. This is a historical fact, but it is not a symptom or characteristic of Graves Disease. Therefore, option (D) is false.\n\nStep 3: Based on our analysis, the correct answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process of muscle contraction and relaxation. Muscle contraction is initiated by a nerve impulse that travels down a motor neuron and triggers the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to receptors on the muscle fibre, causing the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a network of membrane-bound sacs) to release calcium ions into the muscle cell.\n\nThe calcium ions bind to a protein called troponin, which is associated with another protein called actin. This binding causes a conformational change in another protein called tropomyosin, which then exposes the actin binding sites on the thin filaments (actin).\n\nWhen the actin binding sites are exposed, the myosin heads (part of the thick filaments) can bind to the actin, forming cross-bridges. The myosin heads then undergo a power stroke, pulling the thin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere and causing the muscle to contract.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\n(A) If the nerve stimulus is removed, the acetylcholine receptors will no longer be activated, and the calcium ions will not be released. Without calcium ions, the troponin-tropomyosin complex will return to its original position, blocking the actin binding sites on the thin filaments. This prevents further cross-bridge formation and causes the muscle to relax.\n\n(B) If the nerve stimulus is too forceful, the muscle may become overstimulated and enter a state of tetanus. In tetanus, the muscle remains contracted even after the nerve stimulus is removed. This is because the excessive release of acetylcholine causes the muscle to become hypersensitive to calcium ions, leading to continuous cross-bridge formation and muscle contraction.\n\n(C) This option is incorrect because the actin binding sites are not covered by anything. Instead, they are exposed on the surface of the thin filaments.\n\n(D) This option is also incorrect because the actin binding sites are not saturated. Instead, the myosin heads can bind to multiple actin sites during each cross-bridge cycle, allowing for efficient muscle contraction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise, we need to consider the process of energy production in the body during exercise. The primary source of energy for muscle contractions is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is produced through a process called cellular respiration.\n\nDuring high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP increases, and the body needs to produce ATP at a faster rate to meet this demand. This increased demand for ATP can lead to a failure in the ATP supply, which can result in fatigue.\n\nOption C, \"failure of the ATP supply to match the demand,\" is therefore the most likely fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise.

Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals across nerve cells, and they play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including sleep-wake cycles and energy homeostasis.\n\nFatigue can be caused by a variety of factors, including physical exertion, stress, and illness. It is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple brain regions and neurotransmitter systems. Some of the neurotransmitters that have been implicated in fatigue development include:\n\n1. Acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in regulating muscle movement and attention. It has been shown to play a role in the development of fatigue, particularly in situations where attention and cognitive function are impaired.\n2. Noradrenaline: Noradrenaline, also known as norepinephrine, is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of attention, alertness, and arousal. It has been shown to play a role in the development of fatigue, particularly in situations where attention and alertness are impaired.\n3. Dopamine: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of reward, motivation, and movement.

            "model_answer": "To determine how long it may take for pressure damage to be visible, we need to consider the factors that contribute to the development of pressure damage. Pressure damage, also known as pressure ulcers or bedsores, occurs when there is continuous pressure on a specific area of the body for an extended period of time. The risk of developing pressure damage increases with the duration of time spent in a prone position, the level of pressure applied to the skin, and the individual's overall health and mobility.\n\nThe answer to this question depends on several factors, including the patient's overall health, the level of pressure applied to the skin, and the duration of time spent in a prone position. Without more information about these factors, it is difficult to accurately predict how long it may take for pressure damage to become visible.\n\nHowever, in general, pressure damage can take several days or even weeks to develop, depending on the factors mentioned above. In some cases, it may take up to 12 hours for pressure damage to become visible, but this is not always the case.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is (C) 24 hours.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the process of phosphocreatine resynthesis. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that is stored in muscle cells and is rapidly broken down into ATP during high-intensity exercise. After exercise, phosphocreatine is resynthesized from ATP and creatine.\n\nThe resynthesis of phosphocreatine is a two-step process:\n\n1. The first step is the conversion of ATP back into creatine and ADP. This step is relatively fast and occurs in the muscle cells.\n2. The second step is the transport of creatine from the muscle cells into the cytoplasm, where it can be converted back into phosphocreatine. This step is slower and is facilitated by a transporter protein.\n\nThe rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis depends on the availability of the necessary substrates (ATP, creatine, and the transporter protein) and the intensity of exercise. After very high-intensity exercise, the demand for ATP is high, and the muscle cells may be depleted of creatine. In this case, the resynthesis of phosphocreatine will be slower.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can eliminate option A because it is too short. The resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high-intensity exercise is likely to take longer than 10 seconds.\n\nOption B is also too short, so we can eliminate it.\n\nOption C is more likely to be correct because it allows for the two-step process of phosphocreatine resynthesis to occur. However, we need to consider the intensity of exercise. If the exercise was very high-intensity, the resynthesis of phosphocreatine may still be slower than 1 minute.\n\nOption D is the longest option, and it allows for the two-step process of phosphocreatine resynthesis to occur. It is also consistent with the idea that the resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high-intensity exercise is slower.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) about 4 minutes.",
