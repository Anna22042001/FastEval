            "model_answer": "To determine the complementary DNA strand, we need to use the base pairing rules of DNA. DNA consists of two strands that are complementary to each other, meaning that the bases on one strand pair with the bases on the other strand in a specific way. The base pairing rules are as follows:\n\nA pairs with T (adenine with thymine)\nC pairs with G (cytosine with guanine)\n\nGiven the DNA strand 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032, we can see that the complementary strand must have A pairs with T and C pairs with G.\n\nWe need to find the strand that follows this rule. The given options are:\n\n(A) 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032\n(B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032\n(C) 5\u2032 GTT AGC 3\u2032\n(D) 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032\n- A pairs with T, so G pairs with C. This is correct.\n- C pairs with G, so U pairs with A. This is correct.\n\n(B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032\n- A pairs with T, so G pairs with C. This is correct.\n- C pairs with G, so T pairs with A.

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement concerning the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote is correct, we need to understand the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex, is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. It is involved in the processing, modification, and sorting of proteins and lipids that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Golgi apparatus is composed of a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. These cisternae are arranged in a stack, with the cis face (the side closest to the ER) being the entry point for proteins and lipids, and the trans face (the side farthest from the ER) being the exit point.\n\nNow, let's examine each statement:\n\n(A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\nThis statement is correct. The cis face of the Golgi apparatus is oriented towards the ER, and the trans face is oriented towards the cytoplasm. This orientation allows for the efficient transfer of proteins and lipids from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.\n\n(B) It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.\nThis statement is not entirely correct. While the cis face of the Golgi apparatus is associated with small secretory vesicles, these vesicles are not always present, and they are not limited to the cis face. The vesicles are involved in the transport of proteins and lipids within the cell.\n\n(C) Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\nThis statement is not entirely correct. While the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are flattened and membrane-bound, they are not continuous with one another. Instead, they are separated by small vesicles and the cytoplasm.\n\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\nThis statement is correct. Glycosylation is a process in which sugar molecules are added to proteins. This process occurs in the ER prior to the proteins' entry into the Golgi apparatus. Once the proteins enter the Golgi apparatus, they undergo further modification and sorting before being transported to their final destinations.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct statement is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C).\n\nCompetitive inhibitors of enzymes work by competing with the substrate for the same binding site on the enzyme. When a competitive inhibitor binds to the enzyme, it prevents the substrate from binding to the active site, thus reducing the enzyme's ability to catalyze the reaction. This type of inhibition is reversible, as the inhibitor can be displaced by a higher concentration of substrate, and the enzyme can continue to function once the inhibitor is removed.\n\nIn contrast, irreversible inhibitors, such as those described in options (A) and (B), permanently impair the enzyme's function. Option (A) describes covalent modification of the enzyme, which can be reversed by proteolytic enzymes but is typically long-lasting. Option (B) describes modification of the amino acid residues in the active site, which would likely be irreversible and completely abolish the enzyme's activity.\n\nOption (D) describes non-competitive inhibition, which is a different mechanism altogether. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the active site and the substrate binding site. This type of inhibition also reduces the enzyme's activity, but it is not reversible by increasing substrate concentration.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which experimental observation would not be expected, we need to understand the process of in vitro fertilization and the role of ZP3 glycoprotein in this process.\n\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) is a process where sperm and eggs are mixed outside the body to facilitate fertilization. In the case of mouse IVF, the sperm's acrosomal reaction is initiated by the binding of receptor proteins on the sperm surface to the ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida of the egg. The acrosomal reaction is necessary for the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer layer and fertilize it.\n\nNow, let's consider the experimental observations provided:\n\n(A) Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. This observation is expected because the antibodies will bind to the ZP3 glycoprotein, preventing the sperm receptors from binding to it. As a result, the acrosomal reaction will not be initiated, and fertilization will not occur.\n\n(B) Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization. This observation is expected for the same reason as observation (A). By providing purified ZP3, the sperm receptors will bind to it, initiating the acrosomal reaction, and fertilization will not occur.\n\n(C) Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. This observation is expected for the same reason as observations (A) and (B). The antibodies will bind to the ZP3 glycoprotein, preventing the sperm receptors from binding to it and initiating the acrosomal reaction.\n\nNow, let's consider observation (D):\n\n(D) Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads. This observation would not be expected to block in vitro fertilization. ZP2 is another glycoprotein found in the zona pellucida, but it is not involved in the initiation of the acrosomal reaction. Sperm receptors bind to ZP3, not ZP2. Therefore, coating beads with ZP2 would not affect the ability of sperm to bind to ZP3 and initiate the acrosomal reaction.\n\nTherefore, the only experimental observation that would not be expected is (D).",
