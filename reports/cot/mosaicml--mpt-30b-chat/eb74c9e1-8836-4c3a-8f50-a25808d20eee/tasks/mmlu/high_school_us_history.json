After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

            "model_answer": "The perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The passage describes a meeting of working girls during a strike in a large shoe factory. They discuss the difficulties of being on strike, particularly for those who are paying board and are afraid of being put out if they fall too far behind.\n2. One girl suggests forming a boarding club of their own to support each other during the strike.\n3. The Settlement (Hull House) helps to set up the club and provides initial support, but the members manage the club themselves.\n4. The club grows rapidly, occupying all of the six apartments in the building and having 50 members at the end of the third year.\n5. The passage does not mention women's suffrage, trust-busting, or weakening political machines.\n6. However, the passage does highlight the struggles of working-class women and their efforts to support each other during a time of hardship. This suggests a focus on greater rights for unions, which would support the interests of working-class women and help them to stand together in times of struggle.\n7. Therefore, the answer is (C) Greater rights for unions.",

To answer this question, we need to look at the development of the rail system in America during the nineteenth century.\n\nOption A states that government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient. This is correct as the government provided land grants and subsidies to the railroads, which helped in the expansion of the rail network and made it easier for goods and resources to be transported to markets, leading to increased efficiency in production.\n\nOption B states that the entire national system was planned before the first railway was constructed. This is not correct as the development of the rail system was a gradual process, with different railroads being built by private companies. There was no overall plan for a national rail system.\n\nOption C states that the development of the rails had little effect on the development of American industry. This is not correct as the development of the rail system had a significant impact on the development of American industry, as it made it easier to transport goods and resources, leading to increased efficiency in production and expansion of markets.\n\nOption D states that a more highly developed rail system gave the Confederacy a decided advantage in the Civil War. This is not correct as the Union had a more developed rail system and it played a significant role in the Union's victory in the Civil War.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient.",

It was announced by President James Monroe in 1823.\n\n(B) Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\": The \"Big Stick\" was a foreign policy concept introduced by President Theodore Roosevelt. It emphasized the use of military power to enforce US interests abroad.\n\n(C) Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points: The Fourteen Points were a set of principles proposed by President Woodrow Wilson during World War I, aimed at creating a peaceful post-war world. They included ideas such as national self-determination and the reduction of armaments.\n\n(D) Containment policy toward the Soviet Union: Containment was a US foreign policy strategy aimed at preventing the spread of communism and the influence of the Soviet Union. It was introduced during the Cold War and was a key part of US foreign policy until the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the options\nTo determine which option best matches President Bush's \"new world order,\" we need to consider the context in which each of these concepts was introduced and their underlying principles.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine was focused on American interests in the Americas and did not have a global scope. The \"Big Stick\" was about using military power to enforce US interests, which is not the same as promoting global cooperation and harmony.\n\nWilson's Fourteen Points were aimed at creating a peaceful post-war world, but they did not have the same level of ambition as Bush's \"new world order,\" which seeks to create a new era of cooperation and harmony among nations.\n\nThe containment policy toward the Soviet Union was focused on preventing the spread of communism and the influence of the Soviet Union, which is not the same as promoting global cooperation and harmony.\n\nStep 4: Choosing the answer\nBased on the analysis above, the best option that most closely resembles President Bush's \"new world order\" is (D) Containment policy toward the Soviet Union. While the containment policy was not focused on promoting global cooperation and harmony, it was a US foreign policy strategy that aimed to prevent the spread of communism and the influence of a major adversary, which could be seen as a precursor to the more collaborative approach advocated by Bush's \"new world order.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Containment policy toward the Soviet Union.",

The passage is from Benjamin Franklin's Examination before Parliament in 1766, where he discusses the opinion of everyone that they could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein they were not represented. He then explains the difference between external and internal taxes.\n\nExternal taxes are duties laid on commodities imported, which are added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it, they can refuse it. However, internal taxes are forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives.\n\nThe question asks for the policy described in the passage that led to a particular outcome. From the passage, we know that Franklin is discussing the opinion of every one that they could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein they were not represented. This suggests that the policy being discussed is related to taxation without representation.\n\nThe passage also mentions that the Stamp Act says they shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; they shall neither marry nor make their wills, unless they pay such and such sums. This suggests that the policy being discussed is related to the Stamp Act, which was a tax on printed materials, such as legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is related to the Stamp Act and taxation without representation. The Stamp Act was a tax imposed by the British Parliament on the American colonies, which they felt was unfair since they were not represented in the Parliament. This led to widespread protests and boycotts, and eventually, the act was repealed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.
