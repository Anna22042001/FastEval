            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the type of culture that workers' acceptance of change is characteristic of, we need to consider the definition of each culture type and how it relates to change.\n\n1. Team culture: A team culture is characterized by a sense of unity and shared goals among team members. In this culture, workers are focused on achieving common objectives and support each other in their efforts. While team members may accept change in order to benefit the team, it is not specifically mentioned as a characteristic of team culture.\n2. Collaborative culture: A collaborative culture is characterized by cooperation and communication among workers. In this culture, workers are encouraged to share ideas and work together to achieve common goals. While workers may accept change in order to improve collaboration, it is not specifically mentioned as a characteristic of collaborative culture.\n3. Group culture: A group culture is characterized by a sense of belonging and shared values among workers. In this culture, workers are committed to the group's goals and work together to achieve them. While workers may accept change in order to benefit the group, it is not specifically mentioned as a characteristic of group culture.\n4. Collective culture: A collective culture is characterized by a strong sense of community and shared identity among workers. In this culture, workers are focused on achieving the collective goals of the group and are willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. Workers' acceptance of change may be a characteristic of a collective culture, as change can be seen as an opportunity to improve the collective identity and achieve the group's goals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Collective culture.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework is a set of principles and guidelines that guide a company's actions and decision-making processes with regards to its impact on society and the environment. CSR is about going beyond compliance and taking proactive steps to create positive social and environmental impact.\n\nRetaining the status quo is not a characteristic of a CSR framework because CSR is about innovation and finding new ways to create positive change. Understanding society is a key component of a CSR framework because it helps a company understand the impact of its actions on different stakeholders and communities. Harnessing diversity is also important in a CSR framework because it helps a company leverage different perspectives and ideas to create more effective and sustainable solutions.\n\nBuilding capacity is not explicitly mentioned as a characteristic of a CSR framework, but it can be seen as a byproduct of a well-implemented CSR program. By working with local communities and stakeholders, a company can help build capacity and create long-term sustainable solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (D) Building capacity.",

Max Weber was a German sociologist, economist, and political economist who is considered one of the founders of sociology as a scientific discipline.\n2. Weber is best known for his work on organizational theory and the concept of bureaucracy. He argued that bureaucracy was the most efficient and effective form of organization, particularly for large organizations.\n3. Weber's work on bureaucracy was heavily influenced by his study of the German civil service. He observed that bureaucratic organizations were characterized by a clear hierarchy of authority, formal rules and procedures, and a division of labor.\n4. Weber's ideas on bureaucracy have been widely influential in the fields of organizational theory and management. Many modern organizations, including businesses and government agencies, have adopted bureaucratic structures and practices.\n5. Therefore, the writer most associated with bureaucratic structures is Max Weber.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine when an acquisition takes place, we need to understand the definition of an acquisition and the different types of acquisitions.\n\nAn acquisition is a process where one company takes control of another company by purchasing a majority stake or all of the outstanding shares. There are different types of acquisitions, including:\n\n1. Merger: When two companies combine to form a single entity, and the acquiring company usually absorbs the target company.\n2. Purchase: When the acquiring company buys all the outstanding shares of the target company.\n3. Tender offer: When the acquiring company offers to buy the target company's shares directly from its shareholders.\n4. Joint venture: When two companies collaborate to create a new entity, but neither company takes control.\n5. Strategic alliance: When two companies form a partnership to achieve a specific goal, but neither company takes control.\n\nBased on the options provided, we can eliminate (B) and (D) because they do not involve an acquisition.\n\nOption (A) is not an acquisition because it does not involve the purchase of a majority stake or all outstanding shares.\n\nOption (C) is also not an acquisition because it involves two unequal partners joining together, and the acquiring company does not take control.\n\nTherefore, the only option that describes an acquisition is (D). In a buyout, the acquiring company purchases all the outstanding shares of the target company, resulting in the two unequal partners becoming one company.\n\nHence, the answer is (D).",
