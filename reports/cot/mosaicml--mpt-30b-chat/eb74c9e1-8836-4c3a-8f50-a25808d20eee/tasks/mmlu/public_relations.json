            "question": "Which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue?\n\n(A) Interpersonal\n(B) Media\n(C) Group\n(D) Public",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the different forms of communication and their potential impact on forming or changing predispositions toward an issue.\n\n1. Interpersonal communication refers to communication between two or more people in a personal, face-to-face setting. This form of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue because it allows for more personalized and nuanced communication.\n2. Media communication refers to communication through various forms of media, such as television, radio, and social media. This form of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue because it can reach a large audience and can be repetitive, which can help to reinforce messages.\n3. Group communication refers to communication between two or more people in a group setting. This form of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue because it allows for discussion and exchange of ideas, which can help to clarify and reinforce messages.\n4. Public communication refers to communication through public speeches, announcements, and other forms of public address. This form of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue because it can reach a large audience and can be used to convey important messages to the public.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is likely to be a combination of interpersonal, media, and group communication, as well as public communication. However, the specific effectiveness of each form of communication will depend on the context and the nature of the issue being communicated.\n\nAnswer: (D) Public",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of publics as defined by Esman (1972).\n\nAccording to Esman, publics are groups of people who share a concern or interest in an organization or issue. Publics can be classified into four categories based on their relationship with the organization: enabling, functional, normative, and diffused.\n\nEnabling publics are those that provide resources or support necessary for the organization to exist. Functional publics are those that have a direct relationship with the organization and rely on its services. Normative publics are those that have a strong belief or opinion about the organization and its mission. Diffused publics are those that have a more distant relationship with the organization but still have an interest in its activities.\n\nThe answer to the question is that Esman (1972) suggests that which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance? The answer is (A) Enabling publics.",

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) democracy, dialogic.\n\nIn Bakhtin's view, dialogism is the idea that meaning is created through the interaction of different voices and perspectives in a conversation. He believed that in a democratic society, people must be able to engage in open and inclusive dialogue in order to fully understand and address the issues facing their community. This requires a willingness to listen to and learn from others, as well as the ability to express one's own views in a respectful and constructive manner. By fostering a dialogic culture, individuals and communities can work together to create a more democratic and inclusive society.",

The planning process is a series of steps that help to ensure that a program is well-designed and effective.\n2. The first step in the planning process is to define the program, which involves identifying the problem or opportunity that the program is designed to address.\n3. The second step is to plan the program, which involves setting objectives, determining the activities that will be needed to achieve those objectives, and identifying the resources that will be required to carry out those activities.\n4. During the planning stage, objectives are decided on. Objectives are the specific, measurable outcomes that the program is designed to achieve. They are typically based on the needs and priorities of the stakeholders and are used to guide the development of the program.\n5. Therefore, the objectives are decided on during the planning stage of the planning process, which is step 2.\n6. Hence, the correct answer is B. Planning the program.",

            "model_answer": "Current thinking on mass communication has shifted from the idea of passive audiences to a more nuanced understanding of audience engagement and interaction with media messages. The answer that best describes current thinking would be option C: Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this:\n\n1. Early theories of mass communication, such as the Hypodermic Needle Model, suggested that audiences were passive recipients of media messages and that these messages could easily manipulate their beliefs and attitudes.\n2. However, as research in the field of mass communication has progressed, it has become clear that audiences are not as passive as once thought.\n3. People actively engage with media messages, and their experiences with media are shaped by their prior knowledge, beliefs, and cultural background.\n4. This active engagement means that people are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages. Instead, the impact of media messages varies depending on the individual and the context in which they are received.\n5. Therefore, current thinking in mass communication recognizes that audiences are active receivers who engage with media messages in complex and nuanced ways.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.",

Licensing is a process of granting permission or authorization to do something, in this case, to practice public relations.\n2. The purpose of licensing is to ensure that only qualified and competent individuals are allowed to practice a particular profession.\n3. In the case of public relations practitioners, licensing would ensure that only those who have the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience are allowed to work in the field.\n4. This is important because public relations is a critical function in many organizations, and it is essential that the people responsible for managing the organization's image and reputation are competent and trustworthy.\n5.
