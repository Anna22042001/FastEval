            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine how the two stars will appear to the observer's eyes, we need to consider the angular separation between the two stars and the angular resolution of the observer's eyes.\n\nThe angular separation between two stars is the angle between the two stars as seen from the observer's position. The angular resolution of the observer's eyes is the smallest angle that can be distinguished between two point sources of light.\n\nIf the angular separation between the two stars is greater than the angular resolution of the observer's eyes, then the two stars will appear as two distinct points of light. This is because the observer's eyes will be able to distinguish between the two stars.\n\nHowever, if the angular separation between the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of the observer's eyes, then the two stars will appear as a single point of light. This is because the observer's eyes will not be able to distinguish between the two stars, and they will be perceived as a single source of light.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

            "model_answer": "The bolometric luminosity in astronomy is the luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Bolometric luminosity refers to the total amount of energy that a celestial object emits per unit of time.\n2. This energy is emitted across a range of wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays.\n3. The bolometric luminosity is calculated by integrating the object's spectral energy distribution (SED) over all wavelengths.\n4. The SED is a plot of the object's luminosity as a function of wavelength, and it provides information about the object's temperature and the types of radiation it emits.\n5. Since the object emits energy across all wavelengths, the bolometric luminosity is calculated by integrating the SED over the entire range of wavelengths.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) the luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The reason Earth has the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds is because of option (C). The partially molten metallic core and the reasonable rotation rate of Earth contribute to the generation of a magnetic field.\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The strength of a planet's magnetic field is determined by the motion of its electrically conducting material, such as the molten iron in its core.\n2. The motion of this material generates electric currents, which in turn produce a magnetic field.\n3. The strength of a planet's magnetic field is proportional to the rate of flow of material in its core.\n4. Earth's core is partially molten, which means that it is not solid and has a higher rate of flow than the cores of other terrestrial planets.\n5. In addition, Earth's rotation rate is relatively fast, which means that the magnetic field is constantly being regenerated as the molten iron flows and generates new electric currents.\n6. This combination of a partially molten core and a reasonable rotation rate is what makes Earth's magnetic field the strongest among the terrestrial worlds.\n7. Therefore, the answer is (C).",

            "question": "Why are the inner planets made of denser materials than the outer planets?\n\n(A) In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\n(B) In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\n(C) Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\n(D) When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nThe reason why the inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets is because materials naturally segregated into bands when the solar nebula formed a disk. In our particular solar system, the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part. This process is known as gravitational segregation.\n\nThe solar nebula was a cloud of gas and dust that began to collapse under its own gravity, eventually forming the Sun and the planets. As the nebula collapsed, it began to spin, forming a disk-like structure. The materials in the nebula varied in density, with heavier materials being more dense than lighter materials. Due to the laws of gravity, the denser materials were pulled towards the center of the disk, while the lighter materials were pushed to the outer edges.\n\nOver time, the denser materials in the inner part of the disk accumulated to form the inner planets, while the lighter materials in the outer part of the disk accumulated to form the outer planets. The inner planets, including Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are made primarily of rock and metal, while the outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are primarily made of hydrogen and helium.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "To properly account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Ptolemy's model of the universe, known as the geocentric model, was developed in ancient Greece during the 2nd century AD.\n2. In this model, Earth was at the center of the universe, with the sun, moon, stars, and planets orbiting around it.\n3. The planets in Ptolemy's model orbited Earth on \"circles upon circles\" because he believed that the planets moved in a complex series of concentric circles and epicycles, with each circle and epicycle having its own center of motion.\n4. This complex system of circles and epicycles was necessary to explain the varying positions of the planets in the sky, as observed from Earth.\n5. For example, Ptolemy's model allowed him to explain why more distant planets, such as Mars and Saturn, take longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac than closer planets like Venus and Mercury.\n6. This is because the outer planets have larger orbits that take longer to complete, and Ptolemy's circles and epicycles allowed him to account for this difference in time.\n7.
