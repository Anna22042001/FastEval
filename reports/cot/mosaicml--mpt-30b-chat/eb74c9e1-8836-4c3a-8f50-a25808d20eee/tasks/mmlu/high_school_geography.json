            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry?\n\n(A) United States\n(B) Japan\n(C) France\n(D) United Kingdom",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given options is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the natural resources available in each country and the extent to which they rely on imports to meet their demands.\n\n(A) United States: The United States is considered to be one of the world's leading producers of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals. The country also has significant reserves of timber, water, and arable land. Therefore, the United States is likely to be self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is an island nation with limited natural resources. The country has limited deposits of coal, oil, and natural gas, and it relies heavily on imports to meet its energy needs. Japan also imports significant amounts of raw materials for its manufacturing industry. Therefore, Japan is likely to be less self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry compared to the United States.\n\n(C) France: France is located in Western Europe and has a diverse range of natural resources, including coal, iron ore, bauxite, and uranium. The country also has significant reserves of natural gas and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. France is considered to be relatively self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom is located in Northern Europe and has limited natural resources. The country has limited deposits of coal, oil, and natural gas, and it relies heavily on imports to meet its energy needs. The UK also imports significant amounts of raw materials for its manufacturing industry. Therefore, the United Kingdom is likely to be less self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry compared to the United States and France.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the least self-sufficient option in natural resources needed for modern industry is (D) United Kingdom.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process of information diffusion when a new fashion design is introduced globally can be explained through the following steps:\n\nStep 1: The introduction of a new fashion design occurs in a particular location, such as a fashion capital city like Paris, New York, or London.\n\nStep 2: A small group of people, such as fashion influencers, designers, and industry professionals, become aware of the new design.\n\nStep 3: This group of people begins to talk about the new design, share images and videos of it on social media, and showcase it at fashion events.\n\nStep 4: As more people become aware of the new design, they start to adopt and imitate it, leading to the spread of the new fashion trend.\n\nStep 5: The diffusion of the new fashion design can occur through different channels, such as word-of-mouth, social media, and fashion media outlets.\n\nBased on these steps, the most appropriate answer is (C) innovative diffusion. Innovative diffusion refers to the process of information spread through a social network, where people adopt new ideas or products because their peers or influencers have already done so. This process is also known as \"word-of-mouth\" or \"social influence.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is a socio-economic concept that explains the interdependence between the center (core) and the periphery (periphery) of a region or country. The theory suggests that the relationship between the core and periphery is not static but dynamic, and it evolves over time.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement suggests that both developing and developed regions benefit equally from trade. While trade can be beneficial for both parties, it is not always the case that they share equally in wealth. In some cases, the developed region may benefit more from trade, leading to an increase in the wealth gap between the two regions.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement suggests that the core region will always have a superior position over the periphery. While the core may have an initial advantage, it is not necessarily the case that it will always dominate the periphery. The periphery may catch up or even surpass the core under certain circumstances.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement suggests that the growth and prosperity of the core are achieved at the expense of the periphery. This is a controversial statement as it oversimplifies the complex relationship between the core and periphery. While the core's growth may sometimes come at the expense of the periphery, it is not always the case. In some cases, the growth of the core and periphery can be mutually beneficial.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement suggests that regions with an initial advantage will continue to expand their advantage by attracting more resources. This is a key component of Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. The theory suggests that the initial advantage of the core allows it to attract more resources, which in turn reinforces its advantage, leading to a widening wealth gap between the core and periphery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which option is NOT a characteristic of world cities, we need to understand the definition and characteristics of world cities.\n\nWorld cities, also known as global cities or alpha cities, are cities that play a leading role in the global economic, political, and cultural system. They are centers of business, finance, commerce, culture, and tourism.\n\nBased on this definition, we can infer the following characteristics of world cities:\n\n1. Contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations: World cities are home to the headquarters of many multinational corporations, which play a significant role in the global economy.\n\n2. Well connected to secondary-level world cities: World cities are connected to other world cities and secondary-level world cities through transportation networks, communication systems, and economic relationships.\n\n3. Contain many offices of multinational organizations: World cities are home to many offices of multinational organizations, such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank.\n\n4. Found only in the northern and western hemispheres: This is not necessarily true. While most of the well-known world cities are located in the northern and western hemispheres, such as New York, London, and Tokyo, there are also world cities in the southern and eastern hemispheres, such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Mumbai, and Seoul.\n\nBased on these characteristics, we can eliminate option (D) as a characteristic of world cities. Option (D) states that world cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres, which is not true.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The principle of concentrating production activities and people in specific areas to benefit everyone is called agglomeration.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The substitution principle refers to the idea that if one resource is scarce, it can be substituted with another resource. It has nothing to do with the concentration of production activities and people.\n2. Deglomeration is the opposite of agglomeration. It refers to the spreading out of production activities and people.\n3. Agglomeration refers to the clustering of production activities and people in specific areas. This can be beneficial because it allows for the sharing of resources, knowledge, and infrastructure, which can lead to increased productivity and efficiency.\n4. Infrastructure refers to the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise. It is not directly related to the concentration of production activities and people.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) agglomeration.",
