Duty is collected on this and on nothing else. We send it to the land of the pagan Sudan and sell it for two-thirds of its weight in gold, so that we sell 100 measures of this copper for 66 2/3 measures of gold.' He also stated that there are pagan nations in his kingdom from whom he does not collect the tribute (jizya) but whom he simply employs in extracting the gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\"\nFrom N. Levtzion & J.F.P.

            "model_answer": "The passage is from Al' Umari, a Moroccan historian who lived in the 14th century. The passage describes the account of Sultan Musa, who ruled the Mali Empire in West Africa in the 14th century. The passage describes the Sultan's account of his visit to a copper mine in the town of ZKRY, which is located in the kingdom of the Sultan. The Sultan told Al' Umari that the copper mine is the only source of revenue for the kingdom, and that the copper is sold for two-thirds of its weight in gold.\n\nThe passage also states that the Sultan does not collect tribute (jizya) from certain pagan nations in his kingdom, but instead employs them to extract gold from its deposits. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth, and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\n\nBased on the passage, we can infer that:\n\n* The kingdom relies heavily on the revenue generated by the copper mine.\n* The Sultan's kingdom has established trade connections with neighboring pagan nations.\n* The Sultan's kingdom has access to gold deposits, which are extracted by employing pagan nations.\n* The Sultan's kingdom has a well-established system of governance, as evidenced by the collection of duty on the copper mine.\n* The Sultan's kingdom has a diverse population, including both Muslims and pagans.\n\nThe passage does not provide information about the spread of religion through warfare, the development of international trade connections, the spread of diseases along trade routes, or the creation of powerful empires through nomadic migrations. Therefore, the answer to the question is (D) Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.",

Similarly, the Roman Empire relied heavily on barbarian tribesmen, such as the Germanic tribes, to serve as soldiers in their army.\n\nHowever, the other options do not accurately reflect the treatment of barbarian peoples in the ancient world. Option (A) is not accurate because barbarian peoples were often forced to convert to the religions of their host societies through conquest and colonization, rather than through voluntary conversion. Option (C) is not accurate because barbarian peoples were often integrated into their host societies and granted various rights and privileges, rather than being relegated to a servile status.

He emphasizes that the current help for the poor is inadequate, especially in large cities. This highlights the need for socialized programs that would provide better support to the workers.\n\nThe long-term effects of the speech can be seen in the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe.

This suggests that the Winter King had some claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor, or at least to the lands controlled by the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe song also states that the Winter King will have to stay away from both the Rhine and Prague, which were important cities and regions in the Holy Roman Empire.

Bohemia was an important region in the Holy Roman Empire, and its ruler had a significant amount of power within the empire.\n\nBased on the information in the song, it appears that the Winter King did not give over his crown to King Ferdinand, but rather claimed the lands of Bohemia for himself.
