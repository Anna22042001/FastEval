We can divide the rectangle into four regions based on the relative values of $x$ and $y$:\n\n1. $x < y < 3$\n2. $0 < y < x < 3$\n3. $0 < x < y < 2$\n4. $x < 0 < y < 2$\n\nOnly the first region satisfies the condition $x < y$. The area of this region can be found by integrating the probability density function of the bivariate normal distribution with mean $(1.5, 1.5)$ and covariance matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\rho \\\\ \\rho & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ over the region $x < y < 3$.\n\nThe probability density function of the bivariate normal distribution is given by:\n\n$$f(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2\\rho^2 + (\\rho^2 - 1)(x - 1.5)^2(y - 1.5)^2}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho(x - 1.5)(y - 1.5)}{1 - \\rho^2}\\right)$$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by substituting $x = 1.5 + u$ and $y = 1.5 + v$:\n\n$$f(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2\\rho^2 + (\\rho^2 - 1)((u - 0.5)^2 + (v - 0.5)^2)}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho(1.5 + u - 1.5)(1.5 + v - 1.5)}{1 - \\rho^2}\\right)$$\n\n$$f(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2\\rho^2 + (\\rho^2 - 1)(u^2 + v^2)}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho uv}{1 - \\rho^2}\\right)$$\n\nNow we need to integrate this expression over the region $x < y < 3$:\n\n$$\\int_{x<y<3} f(x, y) \\, dy = \\int_{1.5}^{2.5} \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1 - \\rho^2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 2\\rho^2 + (\\rho^2 - 1)(u^2 + v^2)}} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho uv}{1 - \\rho^2}\\right) \\, dv$$\n\nWe can't solve this integral analytically, but we can use numerical methods to approximate the value of the integral for different values of $\\rho$. For $\\rho = 0$, the integral is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$, since the points $(x, y)$ are uniformly distributed in the rectangle. As $\\rho$ increases, the probability of $x < y$ decreases, since the distribution becomes more correlated.\n\nBased on numerical experiments, it appears that the answer is (C), $\\frac{2}{3}$.",

We can start by testing different integer values of $n$ and see if they work:\n\n1. If $n=1$, then $34 = m^2$, which is not possible since $m$ must be positive.\n2.

In other words, it can be factored as:\n\n$n \\cdot 34 = (n+7)(n-6)$\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, we can use the difference of squares factoring method:\n\n$(n+7)^2 - 6^2 = n^2 - 6^2 = m^2$\n\nNow, we can see that $m^2$ is a perfect square, so $m$ must also be a positive integer. We can now use the difference of squares formula to find the smallest possible value of $n$:\n\n$n^2 - 6^2 = m^2$\n\nSince $m^2$ is the smallest possible perfect square greater than $6^2$, we can conclude that $m^2 = 9^2 = 81$.

Substituting this value back into the equation, we get:\n\n$n^2 - 6^2 = 81$\n\n$n^2 - 36 = 81$\n\n$n^2 - 36 = 49$\n\n$n^2 = 49 + 36$\n\n$n^2 = 85$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n$n = \\sqrt{85}$\n\nSince $n$ must be a positive integer, we can round down to the nearest integer:\n\n$n = 5$\n\nTherefore, the least possible positive integer-value of $n$ such that $\\sqrt{18\\cdot n \\cdot 34}$ is an integer is $5$.
