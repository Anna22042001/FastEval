In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.\n4.

This suggests that her fatigue is not severe enough to limit her activities significantly.\n\nThe laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL, which is elevated, but not significantly so. The reference range for leukocytes is 4.5-11.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/mcL. Additionally, 97% of the lymphocytes on the peripheral blood smear are mature-appearing, which is within the normal range.\n\nThe immunohistochemical stains demonstrate the lymphocytes to be of B-cell origin. This is important because it indicates that the lymphocytes are from the immune system and not from the blood-forming organs.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is (A) acute lymphocytic leukemia. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the immune system and is characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of lymphocytes. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and the elevated leukocyte count are consistent with this diagnosis. The fact that the lymphocytes are of B-cell origin is also consistent with acute lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) acute lymphocytic leukemia.",
