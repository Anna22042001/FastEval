            "question": "Approximately how many movies are watched in homes in the United States in one year?\n\n(A) 200,000,000\n(B) 2,000,000,000\n(C) 20,000,000,000\n(D) 200,000,000,000",

            "model_answer": "To estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we need to gather data on the following:\n\n1. The number of households in the United States.\n2. The number of people in each household, on average.\n3. The number of movies watched per person per year.\n4. The percentage of households that watch movies at home.\n\nStep 1: Find the number of households in the United States\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2020, there are approximately 128.2 million households in the United States.\n\nStep 2: Find the average number of people in each household\nThe average size of a household in the United States is approximately 2.8 people.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of movies watched per person per year\nAccording to a 2019 survey by the National Association of Theatre Owners, the average American watches about 6 movies per year in theaters. However, this number does not include movies watched at home. We can assume that the number of movies watched at home is slightly lower than in theaters since some people may go to theaters more often. Let's assume that the average American watches 5 movies at home per year.\n\nStep 4: Find the percentage of households that watch movies at home\nAccording to a 2019 survey by the Consumer Technology Association, 95% of American households own at least one device that can play video content, such as a smartphone, tablet, or streaming device. However, this number does not tell us how many households actually watch movies at home. Let's assume that 80% of households watch movies at home.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of movies watched at home in one year\nTo calculate the number of movies watched at home in one year, we need to multiply the number of households, the average number of people in each household, and the number of movies watched per person per year. Then, we need to multiply this number by the percentage of households that watch movies at home.\n\nNumber of movies watched at home in one year = (number of households x average household size x movies per person per year) x percentage of households that watch movies at home\n\nNumber of movies watched at home in one year = (128,200,000 x 2.8 x 5) x 0.8\n\nNumber of movies watched at home in one year = 1,904,400,000 x 0.8\n\nNumber of movies watched at home in one year = 1,536,800,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 20,000,000,000.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much ice is thrown out by Americans each year and then calculate the energy stored in that ice.\n\nStep 1: Determine how much ice is thrown out by Americans each year\nAccording to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average American consumes about 28 pounds of ice per year. If we assume that all of this ice is thrown out after being used to cool drinks, then the total amount of ice thrown out by Americans each year would be:\n\n28 pounds/year \\* 3.1536 million seconds/year = 87.184 billion seconds/year\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy stored in the ice\nIce has an average density of about 917 kg/m^3. To convert the total mass of ice thrown out by Americans each year into joules, we can use the formula:\n\nEnergy = mass \\* density \\* specific heat capacity \\* change in temperature\n\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is 2.09 J/g*K, and the average temperature difference between a frozen ice cube and a room-temperature drink is about 10 degrees Celsius (or 20 degrees Kelvin). To find the energy stored in the ice, we can rearrange the formula to solve for mass:\n\nmass = Energy / (density \\* specific heat capacity \\* temperature difference)\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nmass = (Energy / (2.09 J/g*K \\* 917 kg/m^3 \\* 20 K))\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total energy wasted each year\nNow that we have the mass of ice thrown out each year, we can calculate the energy wasted by multiplying the mass by the energy per unit mass:\n\nEnergy wasted = mass \\* energy per unit mass\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nEnergy wasted = (87.184 billion seconds/year) \\* (2.09 J/g*K \\* 917 kg/m^3 \\* 20 K) / (1 year)\n\nEnergy wasted = 6 \\* 10^14 J\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 6 \\* 10^14 J.",

Anna feels that she is confusing \"who\" and \"whom\" in her narrative, which suggests that she is having trouble using these words correctly in a sentence.\n\nStep 2: \"Who\" and \"whom\" are pronouns that are used in different ways in a sentence. \"Who\" is used as a subject pronoun, while \"whom\" is used as an object pronoun. In other words, \"who\" is used when referring to the person who is doing something, while \"whom\" is used when referring to the person who is receiving the action.\n\nStep 3: To correct her error, Anna needs to understand the difference between \"who\" and \"whom\" and be able to use them correctly in a sentence.\n\nStep 4: A grammar guide will provide Anna with the necessary information on the proper use of \"who\" and \"whom\" in a sentence.

            "model_answer": "To determine which two planets are most similar in size, we need to compare their diameters. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to gather the diameters of all the planets in our solar system. These values are typically expressed in kilometers.\n2. Next, we need to compare the diameters of each pair of planets to determine which two are most similar in size.\n3. We can use a simple comparison operator, such as \"if\" or \"if and only if,\" to determine if two planets have similar diameters. For example, we could say that planet A is similar in size to planet B \"if and only if\" their diameters differ by no more than a certain percentage.\n4. To determine the percentage difference between two diameters, we can take the absolute difference between the two values and divide it by the average of the two values. This will give us a value between 0 and 1, which we can interpret as a percentage.\n5. We can repeat this process for each pair of planets and choose the two planets with the smallest percentage difference in diameter.\n6. Based on the diameters of the planets, we can see that Venus and Earth are the most similar in size, with a diameter difference of less than 0.1%. Therefore, the answer is (B) Venus and Earth.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
