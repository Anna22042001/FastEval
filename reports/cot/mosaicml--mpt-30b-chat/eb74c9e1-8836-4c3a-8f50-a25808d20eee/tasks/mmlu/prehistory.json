            "model_answer": "The Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from:\n\n(D) larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Levallois technology is a stone tool production technique that emerged around 250,000 years ago in the Lower Paleolithic period.\n2. The main characteristic of Levallois technology is the production of small, sharp stone flakes with a specific shape, called Levallois cores.\n3. These cores were used to produce a variety of stone tools, including knives, scrapers, and spear points.\n4. The Levallois technology is considered a major technological advance because it allowed early humans to produce a wide variety of tools more efficiently than previous techniques.\n5. The question asks about the shift in emphasis that the Levallois technology involved.\n6. Option A is incorrect because it refers to producing core tools, not flakes.\n7. Option B is incorrect because it refers to producing pottery, not clothing.\n8. Option C is incorrect because it refers to producing arrows, not spear points.\n9. The correct answer is option D because the Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones.",

So, it is likely that this option is not correct.\nB) Ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade: The Mayans were known for their ritual ball games, which were an important part of their culture. As for jade, it was highly valued by the Mayans and was used to make jewelry and other artifacts. So, it is likely that this option is not correct.\nC) A sophisticated bronze producing industry: The Mayans did not have a bronze industry. They did, however, work with gold, silver, and copper.

Maize, also known as corn, is a domesticated crop that is widely grown around the world. It is believed to have originated from a wild plant called teosinte, which is still found in Mexico.\n2. Teosinte is considered to be the wild progenitor of maize because it is the closest relative of maize and shares many of the same characteristics, such as having ears with hard, inedible seeds.\n3. While both einkorn and emmer are types of wheat, they are not considered to be the wild progenitor of maize. Legumes, such as beans and peas, are also not related to maize and therefore not its wild progenitor.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is C) Teosinte.",

Teotihuac\u00e1n was one of the largest cities in the world during its peak in the first millennium AD, and it is known for its impressive architecture and monumental structures.\n\nThe largest structure at Teotihuac\u00e1n is the Pyramid of the Sun, which is also the largest pyramid in Mexico. It was built in the first century AD and measures about 74 meters high and 200 meters wide at its base. The pyramid is made of limestone and sandstone and is decorated with intricate carvings and murals.\n\nThe second largest structure at Teotihuac\u00e1n is the Pyramid of the Moon, which is located across from the Pyramid of the Sun. It is slightly smaller than the Pyramid of the Sun, measuring about 65 meters high and 180 meters wide at its base. The pyramid is also decorated with carvings and murals, and it is believed to have been dedicated to the god Quetzalcoatl.\n\nIn addition to these two pyramids, there are several other platform monuments and pyramids at Teotihuac\u00e1n, including the Street of the Dead, the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, and the Citadel. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of platform monuments and pyramids that were built at Teotihuac\u00e1n, but it is believed to be in the hundreds.\n\nBased on the information provided, the answer to the question is (C) Pyramid of the Sun; 600.",

In Mesopotamia, this period of social complexity began around 4000 BCE with the rise of the city-states and continued until the rise of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires.\n\nBefore the advent of social complexity, there were several institutions in Mesopotamia that had powers and were set apart from the rest of society. One of these institutions was the temple.\n\nTemples in Mesopotamia were not only places of worship but also served as administrative centers, economic institutions, and centers of learning. The priests who ran the temples had significant political power and were often involved in the governance of the city-states. The temple was also responsible for maintaining the cult statue of the city's patron god, which was considered the embodiment of the city's power and identity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) the temple.",
