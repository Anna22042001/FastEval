            "model_answer": "For Scenario 1, the main character did something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. This is because the main character knowingly gave the patron regular coffee when they preferred decaf, which could cause inconvenience, discomfort, or even health problems for the patron. This action is considered dishonest and manipulative, and goes against the basic principles of fairness and respect for others.\n\nFor Scenario 2, the main character did not do anything clearly morally wrong. While it may seem unusual to use a toilet brush to clean teeth, it is not inherently harmful or unethical. It is possible that the main character was trying to be helpful or humorous, and did not realize that it could be perceived as inappropriate. Overall, this action does not rise to the level of being clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Wrong, Wrong.",

This action may be seen as a time-saving technique, but it could also be seen as plagiarism, which is a form of academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is considered morally wrong because it violates the intellectual property rights of the original author and undermines the value of education.\n\nStep 2: Based on the actions described and the moral standards that apply to them, the main character's actions in Scenario 1 are morally wrong, while their actions in Scenario 2 are also morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

Paint is toxic and consuming it can cause harm to the person's health. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the main character in this scenario is doing something morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I took pictures of my niece for changing room memories.\n\nThe action described in this scenario is not immediately clear whether it is morally wrong or not. Taking pictures of one's niece is generally not considered morally wrong, and it is a common practice for people to take pictures of their loved ones. However, the phrase \"changing room memories\" is somewhat ambiguous and could refer to a situation where the niece is undressed or in a state of undress. If this is the case, then taking pictures of her in this situation could be considered morally wrong, as it invades her privacy and could make her vulnerable to exploitation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question depends on the interpretation of the phrase \"changing room memories.\" If it refers to a situation where the niece is undressed or in a state of undress, then the main character in this scenario is doing something morally wrong.
