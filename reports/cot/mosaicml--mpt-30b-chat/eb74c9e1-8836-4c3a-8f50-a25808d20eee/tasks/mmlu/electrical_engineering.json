            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the concept of induction heating. Induction heating is a process where an electrical conductor is heated by an alternating current flowing through it. The heating occurs due to the induced eddy currents that are generated in the conductor.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Conducting but non-magnetic materials: This option is correct. Non-magnetic materials like copper, aluminum, and silver are commonly used for induction heating because they can easily conduct electricity.\n\n(B) Conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials: This option is incorrect. While it is true that some magnetic materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt can also be used for induction heating, the question asks for the materials in which induction heating takes place, not the materials that can be used for induction heating.\n\n(C) Insulating materials: This option is incorrect. Insulating materials like rubber, plastic, and glass do not allow electricity to flow through them easily, and therefore, they cannot be used for induction heating.\n\n(D) Conducting and magnetic materials: This option is incorrect. While some induction heating applications use conducting and magnetic materials like transformers, the question asks for the materials in which induction heating takes place, not the materials used in the process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) conducting but non-magnetic materials.",

For example, if we have the decimal number 123.456, we will write it as 123456.\n\nStep 2: Divide the number by 10 and remove the rightmost digit.\n\nStep 3: Repeat step 2 until the number becomes zero. The middle-most digit of the original number is the last non-zero digit obtained in the repeated division process.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given options:\n\nA) First digit from left to right: This option is incorrect because it does not consider the position of the digit in the number.\n\nB) First digit from right to left: This option is also incorrect because it does not consider the position of the digit in the number.\n\nC) Middle digit: This option is correct because the middle digit is the digit that is exactly in the middle of the number when written without commas or decimal point. For example, in the number 123456, the middle digit is 3.\n\nD) Mean of all digits: This option is incorrect because it involves finding the average of all the digits, which is not the same as the middle-most digit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Middle digit.",

We need to analyze each option and determine if it is a valid reason.\n\nStep 3: Evaluation of options\n\n(A) If the electromagnetic forces caused severe stirring action in the molten metal with normal frequency supply, then the molten metal would not be suitable for the intended purpose of the induction furnace. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n(B) Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is the transfer of energy from the primary coil to the secondary coil through magnetic fields. If the coupling is poor, then the energy transfer would be inefficient. This is a valid reason for low frequency supply.\n\n(C) Option (C) combines options (A) and (B).
