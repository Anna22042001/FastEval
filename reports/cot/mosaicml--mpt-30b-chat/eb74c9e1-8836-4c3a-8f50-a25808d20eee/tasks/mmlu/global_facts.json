            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to find the percentage of survey respondents from Mexico who reported having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services. We also need to know which public services were included in the survey.\n\nThe survey was conducted in 2017, and the public services included in the survey are education; judiciary; medical and health; police; registry and permit services; utilities; tax revenue and customs; and land service.\n\nTo find the percentage of respondents who reported having paid a bribe, we need to locate the relevant data in the survey report. The survey report may provide the total number of respondents and the number of respondents who reported having paid a bribe. We can then calculate the percentage by dividing the number of respondents who reported having paid a bribe by the total number of respondents and multiplying by 100.\n\nWithout access to the survey report, we cannot provide an exact percentage. However, we can provide some context based on other sources. According to Transparency International, Mexico has a corruption perception index score of 35 out of 100, where a lower score indicates higher corruption. In the same report, Mexico's public sector is rated as highly corrupt. Therefore, it is likely that a significant percentage of survey respondents from Mexico reported having paid a bribe to access public services in 2017.\n\nBased on this information, we cannot definitively answer the question with a single letter from the options provided. We would need more information from the survey report or other sources to provide an accurate percentage.",
