            "model_answer": "To determine the correct statement about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands, we need to understand the criteria for optical isomerism and the geometry of the complexes.\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a compound has a non-superimposable mirror image, meaning that the compound and its mirror image cannot be aligned to coincide with each other. In coordination complexes, optical isomerism arises from the presence of a chiral ligand or a chiral arrangement of ligands around the central metal atom.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Optical isomerism can occur in square planar complexes with different ligands. For example, the complex [Co(en)\u2082\u2084]+ (where en = ethylenediamine) has two mirror images that are not superimposable, and it displays optical isomerism.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\n\nThis statement is also incorrect. Optical isomerism can occur in tetrahedral complexes. For example, the complex [Cr(NH\u2083)\u2084Cl\u2084]\u00b2\u207a has two mirror images that are not superimposable, and it displays optical isomerism.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nThis statement is partially correct. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when the ligands are different, but they can also display optical isomerism when the ligands are the same. For example, the complex [Fe(CN)\u2086]\u00b3\u207b has two mirror images that are not superimposable, and it displays optical isomerism.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Optical isomerism can occur in octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands with only two different ligands. For example, the complex [Cu(H\u2082O)\u2084]\u00b2\u207a has two mirror images that are not superimposable, and it displays optical isomerism.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct statement is:\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nAnswer: C",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to first understand the concept of nuclear energy levels and the quantum number.\n\nNuclear energy levels are similar to the energy levels of electrons in an atom. They are quantized, meaning that the energy of a nucleus can only take specific values. The energy of a nucleus is determined by its mass defect, which is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons.\n\nThe quantum number is a parameter that describes the energy levels of a nucleus. There are three quantum numbers, labeled as n, l, and j. The value of n determines the main energy level of the nucleus, while l and j determine the sublevels.\n\nNow, let's consider the 55Mn nuclide. The atomic number of manganese is 25, and the atomic mass of manganese is 55. The 55Mn nuclide has 28 neutrons and 27 protons.\n\nTo determine the number of allowed energy levels for 55Mn, we need to find the values of n, l, and j that are allowed for this nuclide. The allowed values depend on the stability of the nucleus, which is determined by the balance between the attractive nuclear force and the repulsive electrostatic force.\n\nFor stable nuclei, the values of n, l, and j are restricted by the following conditions:\n\n1. n must be greater than or equal to 1.\n2. The sum of l and j must be less than or equal to n.\n3. The value of l can be 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1.\n4. The value of j can be -l, -l+1, ..., +l-1, +l.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of allowed energy levels for 55Mn.\n\nSince n must be greater than or equal to 1, the minimum value of n is 1. Therefore, the minimum number of allowed energy levels is 3 (n=1, l=0, and j=-l=0).\n\nHowever, there are more possible values of l and j for n=1, so the actual number of allowed energy levels is greater than 3. The number of allowed energy levels for 55Mn is 8 (3+5).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 8.",

The gyromagnetic ratio is a constant specific to each element and can be found in reference tables. The gyromagnetic ratio for 31P is:\n\n\u03b3 = -6.913 * 10^6 T^-1 s^-1\n\nNext, we plug in the values for the magnetic field strength (B) and the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3) into the Larmor equation:\n\n\u03bd = (-6.913 * 10^6 T^-1 s^-1) * (20.0 T) / (2\u03c0)\n\nNow, we need to convert the units of the magnetic field strength from Tesla (T) to Hertz (Hz).

In this case, we are given that the spectrum contains lines with relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, respectively. This means that the line corresponding to DMSO has a relative intensity of \u03b1, and the line corresponding to AN has a relative intensity of 3\u03b1.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical shift of each solvent. The chemical shift of DMSO is approximately 2.5 ppm, and the chemical shift of AN is approximately 1.2 ppm.\n\nNext, we need to determine the relative intensities of the lines corresponding to each solvent. Since the spectrum contains lines with relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, we can assume that the line corresponding to DMSO has a relative intensity of \u03b1, and the line corresponding to AN has a relative intensity of 3\u03b1.\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the total intensity of the spectrum is equal to 1 to determine the ratio of the two concentrations. The intensity of the line corresponding to DMSO is \u03b1, and the intensity of the line corresponding to AN is 3\u03b1. Therefore, the total intensity of the spectrum is equal to \u03b1 + 3\u03b1 = 1.\n\nSince the total intensity of the spectrum is equal to 1, we can use this information to determine the ratio of the two concentrations. If the intensity of the line corresponding to DMSO is \u03b1, then the intensity of the line corresponding to AN is 1 - \u03b1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the two concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN], is equal to the ratio of the relative intensities of the lines corresponding to each solvent, which is \u03b1:3\u03b1.\n\nSince \u03b1 = 1/3, the ratio of the two concentrations is (1/3):(3/3) = 1:3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 1:3.",
