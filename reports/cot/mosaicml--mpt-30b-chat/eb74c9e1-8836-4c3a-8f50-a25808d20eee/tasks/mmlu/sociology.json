            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (A).\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The study by Brown & Harris (1978) focused on depression.\n2. The question presents four options, each representing a different finding from the study.\n3. To determine which option is correct, we need to evaluate each option and see if it aligns with the findings of Brown & Harris's study.\n4. Option (A) states that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support. This aligns with the findings of Brown & Harris's study, which suggests that social support is an important factor in women's susceptibility to depression.\n5. Option (B) states that self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. This does not align with the findings of Brown & Harris's study, which did not find a correlation between affluence and depression.\n6. Option (C) states that men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. This does not align with the findings of Brown & Harris's study, which found that women are more likely to experience depression than men.\n7. Option (D) states that men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. This does not align with the findings of Brown & Harris's study, which did not explore the relationship between gender roles and depression.\n8. Based on the above evaluation, the correct answer is (A).",

These communities are formed by people who share a common ethnicity and have experienced discrimination due to their identity.\n\nOption B describes gay villages, which are formed in certain parts of large cities. These communities are formed by individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ and seek a supportive community.\n\nOption C describes sociological communities, which are formed by unpopular lecturers. These communities are formed by individuals who have a shared interest in a particular topic and are taught by a particular lecturer.\n\nOption D describes virtual communities that exist only in cyberspace. These communities are formed by individuals who share a common interest and connect through online platforms.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the only option that does not describe a new form of community is option C. Sociological communities are not necessarily a new form of community, as they can be seen as a traditional form of community that has existed for a long time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) sociological communities.",

The embourgeoisement thesis is a sociological concept that refers to the process by which working-class people adopt the values, attitudes, and lifestyles of the middle class.\n2. This process is often driven by economic factors, such as increased affluence and access to consumer goods, as well as cultural factors, such as the diffusion of middle class values and norms through mass media and education.\n3. Option (A) is incorrect because it refers to the replacement of capitalists with salaried managers, which is a different process than embourgeoisement.\n4. Option (C) is incorrect because it refers to the deskilling of white collar occupations, which is a different process than embourgeoisement.\n5. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the class structure has fragmented, which is not necessarily related to embourgeoisement.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer your question, I will first explain Weber's theory of social action and then identify the four ideal types of social action he identified. Finally, I will provide the correct answer.\n\nWeber's theory of social action is based on the idea that individuals act in specific ways based on their beliefs and values. He believed that social action could be understood in terms of the means used to achieve a goal and the ends that are sought. In other words, social action can be either instrumentally-rational or value-rational.\n\nWeber also recognized that social action could be guided by traditional norms and values, or by affective or emotional factors. These three types of social action - traditional, affectual, and value-rational - are considered to be \"ideal types,\" meaning they represent idealized versions of social action that may not always be present in the real world.\n\nNow, to answer your question, the four ideal types of social action that Weber identified are:\n\n1. Instrumentally-rational: This type of social action is based on the efficient use of means to achieve a specific goal. It is characterized by a focus on efficiency and effectiveness.\n2. Value-rational: This type of social action is based on the pursuit of specific values or ends. It is characterized by a focus on moral or ethical principles.\n3. Traditional: This type of social action is based on traditional norms and values that have been passed down through generations. It is characterized by a focus on tradition and continuity.\n4. Affectual: This type of social action is based on emotional or affective factors, such as love or hate. It is characterized by a focus on emotional expression and intensity.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) affectual.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Based on the information given, we can eliminate option D because it states that the use of illegal drugs is very rare, which contradicts the fact that drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture.\n\nStep 2: We can also eliminate option C because it states that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys, but the information given does not provide any evidence to support this claim.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the answer must be option A or option B. Option A states that drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture, which is supported by the information given. Option B states that the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy, but the information given does not provide any evidence to support this claim.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the answer is A.",

This suggests that when men have more free time or when traditional gender roles are disrupted due to both partners working full-time, men are more likely to contribute more to household chores.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is: (B) a social group's consciousness of their status and life chances.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Weber defined a \"class situation\" as a concept in his sociological theory.\n2. To understand the concept of a \"class situation,\" we need to look at Weber's broader theory of social stratification and class.\n3. Weber believed that social stratification is based on three main sources of legitimacy: traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal.\n4. In the context of class, Weber focused on the rational-legal source of legitimacy, which is based on a person's position in the capital, product, and labor markets.\n5. In this context, a \"class situation\" refers to the objective economic and legal positions that individuals hold in the market.\n6. However, Weber also recognized that people's subjective perceptions and consciousness of their social position are important.\n7. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer because it refers to a social group's consciousness of their status and life chances, which is a key aspect of Weber's theory of class situation.\n8. Option (A) is incorrect because it only refers to the exploitation of the working class by their capitalist employers, which is a part of the capitalist mode of production but not the full definition of a class situation.\n9. Option (C) is also incorrect because it only refers to a person's position in the capital, product, and labor markets, which is a part of the objective definition of a class situation but not the full definition.\n10. Option (D) is also incorrect because it only refers to the lifestyle of a social class, as defined by patterns of consumption, which is not a part of the definition of a class situation in Weber's theory.",

            "model_answer": "The ethical problem with covert participant observation is:\n\n(D) subjecting the participants to physical harm\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Covert participant observation involves observing people without their knowledge or consent. This means that the participants may not be aware of the risks involved in being observed, which could potentially put them in harm's way.\n2. In some cases, covert participant observation may involve breaking the law or violating social norms. For example, if a researcher is conducting covert participant observation in a criminal organization, they may put themselves and the participants at risk of physical harm.\n3. Covert participant observation can also lead to a breach of trust between the researcher and the participants. If the participants feel that they have been deceived, they may become angry or resentful, which could lead to physical harm to the researcher.\n4. Finally, covert participant observation can create a sense of paranoia or mistrust among the participants, which could also lead to physical harm. If the participants feel that they are being watched or spied on, they may become defensive or aggressive, which could put the researcher in danger.\n\nTherefore, the ethical problem with covert participant observation is that it can subject the participants to physical harm.",

'Feminist standpoint' refers to a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of understanding and analyzing social phenomena from a women-centered perspective.\n2. This perspective is based on the idea that women's experiences and perspectives are often marginalized or ignored in traditional academic and social discourse.\n3. Therefore, studying society from a feminist standpoint involves examining how gender intersects with other social identities (such as race, class, and sexuality) to shape people's experiences and opportunities.\n4. The goal of this approach is to uncover and challenge the ways in which gender inequality is perpetuated and maintained in society.\n5.

Additionally, short questions may be perceived as less important or not warranting a thoughtful response.\n\nStep 3: Leading questions are those that suggest a particular answer or direction, which can skew the results of the survey. This can happen unintentionally, but it's best to avoid leading questions to ensure accurate and unbiased results.\n\nStep 4: Funnelled questions are those that offer a limited range of options, often leading the respondent towards a particular answer. This can also skew the results of the survey and limit the diversity of responses.\n\nStep 5: To avoid these pitfalls, it's best to use open-ended questions that allow the respondent to provide their own unique and detailed responses. This can help to capture a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the opinions and experiences being surveyed.\n\nAnswer: (D)\n\nNote: The answer is (D) because funnelled questions are the least ideal for surveys among the options provided.",
