            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature through a variety of mechanisms. One of the primary ways the body regulates its internal temperature is through sweating. When the body is overheated, the sweat glands produce sweat, which is then evaporated from the skin's surface, cooling the body down.\n\nAnother way the body regulates its internal temperature is by increasing its heart rate. This increases blood flow to the skin, allowing more heat to be released. Additionally, the body may also increase its respiration rate, which helps to cool the body by increasing the amount of oxygen available to the body's cells.\n\nFinally, the body may also decrease its retention of salt. This can help to reduce the body's overall water content, which can help to reduce the amount of heat the body produces.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is (D) increasing water lost through the skin.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation, we need to consider the metabolic pathways involved in lactate production and utilization.\n\nDuring intense exercise, muscles produce lactate as a byproduct of glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose to produce energy. When the muscle's energy demands are high, glycolysis produces more ATP (adenosine triphosphate) than oxidative phosphorylation, which results in an accumulation of lactate.\n\nLactate is then transported from the muscle cells to the bloodstream, where it can be transported to other tissues for energy production. The main fates of lactate in the body are:\n\n1. Uptake and oxidation by other tissues: Lactate can be taken up by other tissues, such as the liver, brain, and kidneys, and converted back to pyruvate, which can then be used in the citric acid cycle for energy production. This process is called lactate oxidation.\n2. Conversion to glucose in the liver: The liver can convert lactate into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. This process is essential for maintaining blood glucose levels during exercise.\n3. Excretion via the kidneys: Lactate can be excreted by the kidneys, but this is a minor route of elimination.\n\nBased on these metabolic pathways, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is:\n\n(D) Uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is:\n\n(A) variable.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. DNA is composed of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of the DNA molecule.\n2. Each nucleotide is composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n3. There are four types of nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\n4. Purines are nitrogenous bases that have a double ring structure, while pyrimidines have a single ring structure.\n5. Adenine and guanine are purines, while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines.\n6. The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is determined by the number of each type of nucleotide present in the DNA sequence.\n7. Since the DNA sequence can vary between different organisms and even within the same organism, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines can also vary.\n8. Therefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is variable and not determined by the base sequence in RNA, genetically determined, or always 1:1.",

            "model_answer": "The student's process of learning about electrochemical cells can be characterized as elaborative rehearsal.\n\nElaborative rehearsal is a process of learning that involves connecting new information to existing knowledge in order to make the new information more accessible and easier to remember. The student actively relates the information he has learned about redox reactions to the new information about electrochemical cells, which helps him to understand and remember the new material.\n\nThis process is different from chunking, which involves breaking down information into smaller, more manageable pieces. The student's process of learning about electrochemical cells does not involve breaking down the information into chunks.\n\nA network model involves creating connections between different pieces of information in order to form a network of related concepts.

When the rate of glycolysis is high, it produces a lot of ATP and H+. To maintain a stable pH inside the cell, an intracellular buffer is needed to limit the pH changes.\n\nStep 2: Candidates\nThe question provides four options: Glutamine (A), Glucose (B), Carnosine (C), and Amylase (D). We need to determine which of these can act as an intracellular buffer when the rate of glycolysis is high.\n\nStep 3: Analysis\nGlutamine (A) is an amino acid that can act as an intracellular buffer. It reacts with H+ to form glutamate and ammonia (NH3), which can be further converted to glutamine. This process helps maintain the pH inside the cell.\n\nGlucose (B) is a sugar and a source of energy for cells. It does not have the ability to buffer pH changes.\n\nCarnosine (C) is a dipeptide (a combination of two amino acids) that can act as an intracellular buffer. It reacts with H+ to form carnosine-H+ and histidine. When the pH decreases, carnosine-H+ is converted back to carnosine, which can then react with more H+ ions.\n\nAmylase (D) is an enzyme that breaks down starch into glucose.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine during exercise.\n\nATP is the primary energy source for muscle contractions during exercise. When a muscle fiber contracts, it uses about 10-30 moles of ATP, depending on the intensity of the exercise. Each mole of ATP provides about 7-8 kcal of energy. So, the energy released from the breakdown of ATP can be calculated based on the intensity of the exercise.\n\nPhosphocreatine is quickly converted to ATP during high-intensity exercise, providing an additional energy source. It provides about 30-40 moles of ATP per kg of muscle tissue, which is equivalent to about 3-4 kcal per gram of muscle tissue.\n\nNow, let's consider the different options provided:\n\n(A) 1-2 seconds: This is too short of a time for any meaningful exercise.\n\n(B) 5-10 seconds: This is still too short of a time for any meaningful exercise.\n\n(C) 30-40 seconds: This is the time during which the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise. At maximal exertion, muscle fibers contract at their maximum rate, and the energy systems work together to provide the necessary energy. The anaerobic system, which relies on ATP and phosphocreatine, is the primary energy system used during maximal exertion, and it can sustain this level of activity for about 30-40 seconds.\n\n(D) 50-60 seconds: This is the time during which the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain high-intensity exercise. At this level of intensity, the anaerobic system is still the primary energy system used, but the aerobic system begins to contribute more significantly. The energy systems work together to provide the necessary energy, and the exercise can be sustained for about 50-60 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
