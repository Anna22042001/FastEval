            "model_answer": "According to Hourdequin, individualism leads to two main problems:\n\n1. Failure of developing integration and integrality: Individualism promotes the idea that the self is a separate entity that should be prioritized above all else. This can lead to a lack of connection and cooperation with others, which can ultimately result in a lack of integration and wholeness within society.\n2. \"Tragedy of the commons\" situations: Individualism can lead to a situation where individuals prioritize their own self-interest above the common good. This can result in a \"tragedy of the commons,\" where individuals overuse a shared resource until it is depleted.\n\nThe correct answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to examine Philippa Foot's argument for the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction. Foot's argument is based on the idea that there are certain actions that are inherently wrong, regardless of their consequences. She uses the example of a doctor who is faced with the choice of either killing a patient or letting them die to illustrate this point.\n\nFoot argues that the doctor has a moral obligation to act in a way that minimizes harm, but that there is a fundamental difference between actively causing harm and failing to prevent harm. In other words, it is morally wrong to kill a patient, but it is not morally wrong to let a patient die if there is nothing that can be done to save them.\n\nFoot's argument for the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction is based on the idea that there are certain actions that are inherently wrong, regardless of their consequences. This is why option (D) is incorrect. Option (D) suggests that the killing/letting die distinction is not morally relevant, which is not what Foot argues.\n\nFoot does not appeal to rights of noninterference (option A) or rights to goods and services (option B) in her argument for the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction. Therefore, options (A) and (B) are also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) both A and B.",

Singer's three-premise argument is an argument for effective altruism, which is the idea that one should use their resources to do the most good possible.\n2. In the argument, Singer presents three premises:\n3. Premise 1: If one is in a position to help others, one should do as much good as one can.\n4. Premise 2: One can do more good by giving money to effective charities than by keeping it for oneself.\n5. Premise 3: If one believes that one has a duty to help others, then one should act on that belief by giving money to effective charities.\n6. Singer's argument is a rational argument that appeals to reason and not just emotions.\n7.

He argues that we have a responsibility to preserve certain aspects of human nature that are not reducible to preferences or desires. This suggests that Sandel's argument is not primarily concerned with the ethics of prima facie duty, as that approach is more focused on actions and their consequences rather than the nature of human beings.\n\nSimilarly, Sandel's argument does not seem to be primarily concerned with natural law theory, which is focused on discovering the inherent moral principles that govern human behavior. Instead, Sandel's argument seems to be more concerned with the consequences of using technology to manipulate human nature and the importance of preserving certain aspects of human nature that cannot be reduced to preferences or desires.\n\nInstead, Sandel's argument seems most closely aligned with a virtue ethics approach, which emphasizes the importance of cultivating certain virtues and character traits. Sandel's argument suggests that using technology to manipulate human nature could lead to a loss of certain virtues and character traits that are important for leading a good life. Additionally, virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of developing a sense of what is good for humans as a whole, rather than just individual preferences or desires, which aligns with Sandel's argument that we have a responsibility to preserve certain aspects of human nature.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) a virtue ethics approach.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to examine Marquis' views on abortion. Marquis is a prominent philosopher who has written extensively on the topic of abortion. He is known for his \"personhood theory\" of when human life begins, which holds that human personhood begins at conception.\n\nAccording to Marquis, human personhood begins at conception because at that point, the embryo has the potential to develop into a person with its own distinct psychological and physical characteristics. Therefore, according to Marquis, any action that destroys the potential for personhood is morally wrong.\n\nBased on this theory, it seems likely that Marquis would choose option (A) or (B) as the correct answer. Option (A) states that abortion is absolutely wrong, which would align with Marquis' view that any action that destroys potential personhood is morally wrong. Option (B) states that abortion is seriously presumptively wrong, which would suggest that there may be some circumstances in which abortion is morally permissible, but that it is generally wrong.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Marquis has also written that \"abortion is wrong because it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being\" (Marquis, 2011, p. 27). This suggests that he may view abortion as more than just presumptively wrong, and that there may be no circumstances in which it is morally permissible.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question depends on how strictly one interprets Marquis' views.
