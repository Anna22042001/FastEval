            "model_answer": "The structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network is:\n\n(D) The use of a constant-term unit input\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network is mainly determined by the complexity of the model, which is influenced by several factors. Here are the explanations for each of the options:\n\n(A) The number of hidden nodes: Increasing the number of hidden nodes in a neural network can increase its capacity to fit the training data, which can reduce overfitting. However, it can also increase the risk of overfitting if the model becomes too complex.\n\n(B) The learning rate: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size during optimization. A high learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may also increase the risk of overfitting, while a low learning rate can reduce overfitting but may lead to slower convergence.\n\n(C) The initial choice of weights: The initial choice of weights in a neural network can affect its ability to fit the training data. Random initialization of weights can help reduce overfitting by making the model more generalizable. However, if the initial weights are too small or too large, it can affect the training dynamics and lead to either underfitting or overfitting.\n\n(D) The use of a constant-term unit input: In a neural network, the constant-term unit input, also known as the bias unit, is a special input unit that adds a constant value to the activations of the other units. The presence or absence of a constant-term unit input can have a significant impact on the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. Without a constant-term unit input, the neural network may struggle to fit the data, leading to underfitting. On the other hand, with a constant-term unit input, the neural network can fit the data more easily, but it may also be more prone to overfitting if the model becomes too complex. Therefore, the use of a constant-term unit input is the structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network.\n\nAnswer: D",

CPUs are typically used for training large neural networks because they are better suited for handling the computational demands of training. GPUs are more commonly used for smaller networks or for accelerating the inference phase.\n2. The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\nThis statement is also true. ResNet-50 is a deep neural network architecture that has over 50 million parameters.

It measures the ratio of the intersection area of two bounding boxes to the union area of them. In object detection, a bounding box with a high IoU is considered a more accurate prediction, as it overlaps more with the ground truth bounding box.\n\nIn the given options, (D) states that a bounding box with an IoU of $3\\%$ would likely be considered a false negative. This is incorrect because a low IoU value indicates that the predicted bounding box does not overlap much with the ground truth bounding box, which makes it difficult to determine whether it is a true or false negative. In such cases, it is not possible to definitively classify the prediction as true or false without further information or human annotation.

When the regularization coefficient $\\lambda$ is increased, the penalty for large weights becomes stronger, and the model will be encouraged to have smaller weights.\n\nNow let's consider the effect of increasing the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient on the bias and variance of the model.\n\nThe bias of a linear regression model is the difference between the predicted values and the true values on the training set. The variance is the variability of the predicted values for a given set of input features.\n\nWhen we add $\\ell_2$ regularization, we are effectively constraining the weights to be smaller. This will cause the model to be less flexible and less able to fit the training data perfectly. As a result, the bias of the model will increase, meaning that the predicted values will be further away from the true values on the training set.\n\nAt the same time, the variance of the model will also increase. This is because the model is less flexible and cannot adapt as well to the noise in the training data. As a result, the predicted values will be more variable for a given set of input features.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Bias increase ; Variance increase.",

The first statement suggests that 1-NN with unweighted Euclidean distance may perform better in classification after mapping the data into a feature space.

L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term that is proportional to the square of the coefficients.
