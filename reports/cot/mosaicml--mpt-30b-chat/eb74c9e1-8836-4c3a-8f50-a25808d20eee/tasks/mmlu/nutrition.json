            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct statement, we need to consider the effects of different types of dietary fat on blood lipid metabolism.\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because n-6 PUFAs are typically found in vegetable oils and have been shown to reduce triglyceride levels in the blood.\n\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. This is because MUFAs tend to be more strongly associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels.\n\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. This is because these substances can interfere with the absorption of cholesterol in the gut, leading to higher levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood.\n\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because carbohydrates, especially refined ones, tend to be high in triglycerides and can lead to increased levels of triglycerides in the blood. Additionally, replacing saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates can lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (D).",

The main function of nitrogenous compounds in the body is to transport and store nitrogen, which is an essential element for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids.\n\nThere are three main nitrogenous compounds in the body: urea, uric acid, and ammonia.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct statement, we need to understand the concept of vitamin C and its relationship with oxygen in canned foods.\n\nVitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is sensitive to heat, light, and air. It plays an essential role in the human body, acting as an antioxidant and supporting various biological functions.\n\nCanned foods undergo a process called canning, which involves heating the food to a high temperature to kill bacteria and preserve the food. However, this process can also lead to the destruction of vitamin C. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a balance between preserving the vitamin C and ensuring the safety of the canned food.\n\nNow let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) The amount of oxygen available in the headspace of canned food is kept at a high level so as to limit losses of vitamin C: This statement is incorrect. Oxygen is not the primary factor affecting vitamin C loss in canned foods. While oxygen can contribute to vitamin C degradation, the main cause of vitamin C loss in canned foods is the heat treatment during the canning process.\n\n(B) Reheating canned vegetables before serving only causes small losses of vitamin C: This statement is partially correct. Reheating canned vegetables can cause some loss of vitamin C, but it is not significant compared to the loss that occurs during the canning process itself.\n\n(C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables: This statement is correct. Fruits generally have higher levels of vitamin C than vegetables, and the canning process can cause more significant losses in fruits. Additionally, fruits tend to have a lower heat tolerance than vegetables, meaning that the heat treatment required for canning can cause more significant losses of vitamin C in fruits.\n\n(D) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small: This statement is partially correct. While storage at ambient temperature can cause some loss of vitamin C in canned foods, it is not a significant factor compared to the loss that occurs during the canning process and the exposure to light and air.\n\nBased on the analysis above, statement (C) is the correct answer.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the most correct statement about absorption from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, we need to consider the process of absorption and the specific nutrients involved.\n\nAbsorption in the GI tract occurs through passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Nutrients such as glucose, fructose, and galactose are absorbed through different mechanisms.\n\n(A) The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake. This statement is incorrect because glucose absorption does not require sodium uptake. Glucose is absorbed through facilitated diffusion, using a glucose transporter protein located in the brush border membrane of the small intestine.\n\n(B) Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose. This statement is partially correct. Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose in the small intestine, but both sugars are absorbed in the same location (brush border membrane).\n\n(C) Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane. This statement is incorrect. Galactose and fructose are absorbed by different transporters. Fructose is absorbed through facilitated diffusion using a glucose transporter protein, while galactose is absorbed through active transport using a specific galactose transporter protein.\n\n(D) Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon. This statement is incorrect. The majority of water absorption occurs in the small intestine, not the colon. The colon's primary function is to absorb electrolytes and water through active transport, which helps form feces.\n\nBased on the above explanations, the most correct statement about absorption from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract is (B) Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose.",
