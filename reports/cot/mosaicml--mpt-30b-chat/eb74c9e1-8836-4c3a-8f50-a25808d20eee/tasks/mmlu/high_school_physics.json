            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "When a whiffle ball is tossed straight up, it will experience an acceleration due to gravity which will cause it to speed up as it moves upwards. Air resistance will cause the ball to slow down slightly, but it is not significant enough to negate the effect of gravity. Therefore, the ball's speed will not be zero at the highest point.\n\nSince the ball is not moving in a vacuum, air resistance will continue to act on the ball, causing it to slow down as it falls back down. This means that the ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point.\n\nThe time it takes for the ball to travel up to the highest point will depend on its initial velocity, and the acceleration due to gravity. The time it takes to fall back down will also depend on its speed at the highest point, which is not zero. Therefore, it is not true that the ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (D) I & III only.",

One common source of error is the buildup of static electricity on the oil drop, which can cause a charge to develop. Another source of error is the movement of the oil drop in the electric field, which can cause the charge to change.\n\nTo minimize the effects of static electricity, the experimenter should ground themselves and use a grounded metal container to hold the oil drop.
