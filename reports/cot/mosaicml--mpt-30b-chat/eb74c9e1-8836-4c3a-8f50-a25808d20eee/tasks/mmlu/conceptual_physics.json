            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein in 1915. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n\nStep 2: According to general relativity, light is not a particle but a wave that travels through spacetime. When light passes through a region of spacetime that is curved by the presence of mass, its path is bent.\n\nStep 3: In the case of the Sun, the gravity of its massive core causes spacetime to curve, which in turn bends the path of light as it leaves the Sun. This effect is known as gravitational redshift, which causes light to be slowed down as it climbs out of the gravitational well of the Sun.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, option (A) is correct.\n\nStep 5: Option (B) is also correct because the path of light is bent as it passes the Sun, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing.\n\nStep 6: Option (C) is also correct because general relativity predicts that time runs slower in a stronger gravitational field, such as that near the surface of the Sun. This effect is known as gravitational time dilation.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the answer is (D) All of these.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the definition and functioning of a galvanometer. A galvanometer is an instrument used to measure the electric current or voltage in a circuit.\n\nA galvanometer works on the principle of magnetic field deflection. When an electric current passes through a wire, it creates a magnetic field around the wire. The galvanometer consists of a movable coil of wire inside a fixed magnetic field. The deflection of the coil depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the current passing through the coil.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Current: The galvanometer is primarily used to measure electric current. It can detect the flow of electric charge through a conductor. Therefore, the galvanometer can be calibrated to read electric current.\n\n(B) Voltage: The galvanometer is not directly used to measure voltage. Voltage is the electric potential difference between two points in a circuit. However, the voltage can be indirectly measured using a galvanometer by connecting it in series with the circuit and measuring the current that flows through it. The current-voltage relationship can be determined using Ohm's law.\n\n(C) Either of these: The galvanometer can be calibrated to read either electric current or voltage, depending on how it is connected in the circuit.\n\n(D) Neither of these: The galvanometer cannot be calibrated to read neither electric current nor voltage. It is designed specifically for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Current.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "When an element ejects a beta particle, the atomic number of that element reduces by 1.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. When an element ejects a beta particle, it undergoes a radioactive decay process.\n2. During this process, the neutron in the nucleus of the atom is converted into a proton, which increases the number of protons in the nucleus by 1.\n3. However, the number of electrons in the atom also needs to be balanced with the number of protons to maintain the stability of the atom.\n4. Therefore, when the atomic number increases by 1, the electron configuration of the atom also changes to accommodate the additional proton.\n5. This change in electron configuration may result in the formation of a different element with a lower atomic number.\n6. Hence, the atomic number of the element reduces by 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) reduces by 1.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "When you change the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire, you create a magnetic field inside the loop. According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, a change in magnetic field creates an electromotive force (EMF) in the loop. This EMF generates a voltage across the terminals of the loop, which in turn creates a current through the loop. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) all of these.\n\nNow, let me explain the process in more detail:\n\n1. When you change the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire, you create a time-varying magnetic field.\n2. According to Faraday's law, the EMF induced in the loop is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic field multiplied by the circumference of the loop.\n3. The EMF generates a voltage across the terminals of the loop, which is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and the rate at which it changes.\n4. The voltage created across the terminals drives a current through the loop, according to Ohm's law.\n5. Therefore, when you change the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire, you create both a current and a voltage, so the answer is (A) current and (B) voltage. However, this does not create an electric field inside the loop, so the answer is not (C) electric field.\n\nHence, the final answer is (A)(B).",

When light hits an object, some of it is absorbed and some of it is reflected. The color that you see is determined by the specific wavelengths of light that are reflected.\n\nIn the case of red petals, the petals are reflecting a specific range of wavelengths that are in the red part of the color spectrum. However, this is not the entire story. The color that you see is also influenced by the way that your eyes and brain process the light that is reflected by the petals.\n\nYour eyes contain specialized cells called photoreceptors that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. These cells send signals to your brain, which then processes these signals to create the perception of color. The specific combination of wavelengths of light that are reflected by the petals and the way that your eyes and brain process that light will determine the exact color that you see.\n\nBased on the above explanation, the correct answer is (A) red.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which option is correct, we need to understand what a sonic boom is and when it occurs.\n\nA sonic boom is a sound wave that occurs when an object traveling through the air, such as an aircraft, moves faster than the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies with temperature and altitude, but at sea level it is approximately 343 meters per second (1,125 feet per second).\n\nNow let's consider each option:\n\n(A) Breaking the sound barrier: This occurs when an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound. At this point, a shock wave forms ahead of the aircraft, and when the shock wave reaches the ground, it creates a sonic boom. So, if an aircraft is breaking the sound barrier, it will produce a sonic boom.\n\n(B) Pulling out of a subsonic dive: If an aircraft is diving at a subsonic speed and then pulls out of the dive, it will be accelerating and may reach a speed faster than sound. If it does, it will produce a sonic boom as it accelerates through the sound barrier.\n\n(C) Flying faster than sound: If an aircraft is flying at a speed faster than sound, it will produce a sonic boom.\n\n(D) Each of these produces a sonic boom: All three options (A), (B), and (C) can produce a sonic boom.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the height of a barometer that uses water instead of mercury, we need to consider the difference in properties between water and mercury.\n\n1. Density: Water has a density of 1 g/cm\u00b3, while mercury has a density of 13.5 g/cm\u00b3. This means that mercury is more dense than water, and therefore will create a taller column in the barometer tube.\n2. Boiling point: Water has a boiling point of 100\u00b0C, while mercury has a boiling point of 356\u00b0C. This means that water can evaporate and create a vacuum in the barometer tube, while mercury cannot.\n3. Expansion: Both water and mercury expand when they freeze. However, water expands more than mercury, by about 9% compared to 2.3% for mercury. This means that the water in the barometer tube will expand and contract more, which could affect the accuracy of the barometer.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that a barometer that uses water instead of mercury will be taller.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to look at the process of nuclear fusion. When a fusion reaction occurs, it involves the combination of two light nuclei to form a heavier nucleus. In this case, we are looking at the fusion of two hydrogen isotopes, specifically deuterium (hydrogen-2) and tritium (hydrogen-3), to form an alpha particle (helium-4) and a neutron.\n\nWhen this fusion reaction occurs, the energy released is primarily due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2. In this case, the mass difference between the reactants (deuterium and tritium) and the products (alpha particle and neutron) is converted into energy.\n\nNow, let's consider the different forms of energy that could be released during this fusion reaction.\n\n(A) Gamma radiation: Gamma radiation is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation, similar to X-rays but even more energetic. In some fusion reactions, gamma radiation can be produced as a byproduct, but it is not the primary form of energy released.\n\n(B) Kinetic energy of the alpha particle: An alpha particle is a helium nucleus consisting of two protons and two neutrons. In this case, the alpha particle is formed as a result of the fusion reaction and will have some kinetic energy depending on the reaction conditions. However, the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is not the primary form of energy released in the fusion reaction.\n\n(C) Kinetic energy of the neutron: Neutrons are neutral particles and do not have a charge that would allow them to emit radiation. However, they can be emitted with kinetic energy in the form of a neutron beam. In some fusion reactions, a high-energy neutron can be produced, but it is not the primary form of energy released.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\n(D) All of these about equally.\n\nIn a fusion reaction, the energy released is primarily in the form of high-energy photons (gamma radiation), which can be emitted by the excited nuclei involved in the reaction. Additionally, some of the energy can be carried away by the kinetic energy of the alpha particle and neutron. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that all of these forms of energy could be significant in a fusion reaction, with gamma radiation being the primary form of energy release.",

The centripetal force is provided by the satellite and acts towards the center of the orbit, perpendicular to the direction of motion.\n\nIn a circular orbit, the satellite's speed is constant, so the centripetal force is also constant.
