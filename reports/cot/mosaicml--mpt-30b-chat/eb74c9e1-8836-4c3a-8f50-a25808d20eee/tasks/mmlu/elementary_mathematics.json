To narrow it down further, we can estimate the product of 68 and the difference between 32 and 40:\n\n68 x (32 - 40) = 68 x (-8) = -544\n\nSubtracting this from our upper bound, we get:\n\n27,200 - 544 = 26,656\n\nAnd adding it to our lower bound, we get:\n\n12,800 + 544 = 13,344\n\nSo, we can narrow down the answer to:\n\n(D) 18,000 and 28,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D)",
