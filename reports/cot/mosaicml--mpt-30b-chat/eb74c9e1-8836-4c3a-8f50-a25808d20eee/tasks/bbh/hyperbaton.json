Size (big, small)\n2. Shape (round, square)\n3. Color (red, blue)\n4. Material (wood, metal)\n5. Age (old, new)\n6. Nationality (American, British)\n7. Purpose (cooking, swimming)\n\nNow let's apply these rules to the two options:\n\nOption A: snorkeling iron prismlike orange midsize knife\n\n1. Snorkeling is a purpose, so it should come last.\n2. Iron is a material, so it should come before the purpose.\n3. Prismlike is a shape, so it should come before material.\n4. Orange is a color, so it should come before shape.\n5. Midsize is a size, so it should come before color.\n\nSo the correct order for Option A is: snorkeling iron prismlike orange midsize knife.\n\nNow let's do the same for Option B:\n\nOption B: midsize prismlike orange iron snorkeling knife\n\n1. Midsize is a size, so it should come before any other adjective.\n2. Prismlike is a shape, so it should come before color.\n3. Orange is a color, so it should come before material.\n4.

We start with the largest or most intense adjective in the sentence, which is \"enormous.\"\n2. Next, we have \"blue,\" which is a smaller adjective in terms of intensity.\n3.
