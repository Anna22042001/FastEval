Since the bakery was closed after 9pm, Samantha could not have gone to the bakery during that time.\n\nNext, we look at the other activities Samantha was engaged in. We know that:\n\n* Sarah saw Samantha walking in the garden from 6am to 11am.\n* Sean saw Samantha taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 12pm to 1pm.\n* Jason saw Samantha taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 1pm to 2pm.\n* Elizabeth saw Samantha walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 2pm to 3pm.\n\nNone of these activities overlap with the time when Samantha was at the deli. However, we need to check if any of these activities overlap with the time when the bakery was open.\n\nThe bakery was open from an unknown time before 1pm to 12pm, when Sean saw Samantha taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Therefore, the earliest Samantha could have gone to the bakery is after 12pm.\n\nThe latest Samantha could have gone to the bakery is before 3pm, when Elizabeth saw her walking towards the Statue of Liberty. Therefore, the latest possible time for Samantha to have gone to the bakery is 2:59pm.\n\nSince the earliest and latest possible times for Samantha to have gone to the bakery do not overlap, the only option that is correct is:\n\n(D) 6am to 11am",

Susan couldn't have gone to the museum during the time she was at the airport (9am - 1pm) or during the time she was working (4pm - 5pm) because she would have had to leave her other activities to go to the museum and return.\n\nStep 5: That leaves us with two possible time gaps: (A) 5pm to 6pm and (B) 6pm to 9pm.\n\nStep 6: Let's check if Susan could have gone to the museum during these time gaps without interrupting her other activities.\n\nFor option (A) 5pm to 6pm:\n\n* Susan could have gone to the museum after buying cookies (5pm) and before going to the rooftop (6pm).\n* During this time, she could have visited the museum and still had time to go to the rooftop before it closed at 9pm.\n\nFor option (B) 6pm to 9pm:\n\n* Susan could have gone to the museum after buying cookies (5pm) and before being seen on the rooftop (6pm).\n* However, this means that she would have had to leave the museum before it closed at 9pm to avoid being seen by Kimberly.\n\nStep 7: Based on the timeline and the logic of Susan's activities, it is more likely that Susan went to the museum between 5pm and 6pm (option A).\n\nAnswer: (A) 5pm to 6pm",
