We can represent this with two arrows pointing left:\n```\n  quail\n    |\n  blue jay\n    |\n  hummingbird\n```\nStep 3: We also know that the cardinal is the third from the left, so it must be either the second or third object from the right end. Since the quail is the second from the left, the cardinal cannot be the rightmost.\n\nStep 4: The only remaining option for the cardinal's position is the third from the right. We can represent this with an arrow pointing right:\n```\n  quail\n    |\n  blue jay\n    |\n  hummingbird\n     |\n   cardinal\n```\nStep 5: Now we can see that the hawk and blue jay are the only two objects that have not yet been placed in the diagram.

The raven is the third from the left.\n\nUsing this information, we can determine the position of each bird on the branch:\n\n* The owl is the leftmost bird, so it must be in the first position.\n* The robin is to the left of the raven, so it must be in the second position.\n* The quail is the rightmost bird, so it must be in the fifth position.\n* The raven is the third from the left, so it must be in the third position.\n* The falcon is the rightmost bird among the remaining ones, so it must be in the fourth position.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The robin is the rightmost.",

Only the option that leads to a contradiction is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's start with option A: The minivan is the second-newest.\n\nIf the minivan is the second-newest, then it must be older than the hatchback and the convertible but younger than the bus. However, we know that the bus is newer than the hatchback, and the convertible is newer than the hatchback. This means that the minivan cannot be the second-newest because it would have to be older than both the hatchback and the convertible, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, option A is not the correct answer.\n\nNow let's consider option B: The hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nIf the hatchback is the second-newest, then it must be older than the convertible but younger than the bus and the minivan. However, we know that the bus is newer than the hatchback, and the minivan is the newest. This means that the hatchback cannot be the second-newest because it would have to be older than the convertible, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, option B is not the correct answer.\n\nNow let's consider option C: The bus is the second-newest.\n\nIf the bus is the second-newest, then it must be older than the hatchback and the convertible but younger than the minivan and the motorcyle. However, we know that the bus is newer than the hatchback, and the convertible is newer than the hatchback. This means that the bus cannot be the second-newest because it would have to be older than both the hatchback and the convertible, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, option C is not the correct answer.\n\nNow let's consider option D: The convertible is the second-newest.\n\nIf the convertible is the second-newest, then it must be older than the hatchback but younger than the bus, the minivan, and the motorcyle. However, we know that the bus is newer than the hatchback, and the minivan is the newest. This means that the convertible cannot be the second-newest because it would have to be older than the hatchback, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, option D is not the correct answer.\n\nFinally, let's consider option E: The motorcyle is the second-newest.\n\nIf the motorcyle is the second-newest, then it must be older than the bus and the minivan but younger than the hatchback and the convertible. However, we know that the bus is newer than the hatchback, and the minivan is the newest. This means that the motorcyle cannot be the second-newest because it would have to be older than both the bus and the minivan, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, option E is not the correct answer.\n\nThe only option that led to a logical contradiction in all cases is option A: The minivan is the second-newest.
