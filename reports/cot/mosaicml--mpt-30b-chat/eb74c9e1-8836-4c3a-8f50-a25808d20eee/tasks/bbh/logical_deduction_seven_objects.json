Then, we will use the given information to eliminate all the options that are not consistent with our assumption. Eventually, we will be left with only one option, which will be the correct answer.\n\nLet's start with option (A): The plums are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the plums are not the most expensive, because the loquats are more expensive than the apples, and the loquats are the fourth-most expensive. Therefore, the plums cannot be the most expensive, which means they cannot be the second-cheapest. We can eliminate option (A).\n\nNow let's consider option (B): The kiwis are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the kiwis are less expensive than the apples, and the loquats are more expensive than the apples. Therefore, if the kiwis were the second-cheapest, the loquats would have to be the second-most expensive. However, we know that the plums are the second-most expensive, which means the loquats cannot be the second-cheapest. We can eliminate option (B).\n\nNow let's look at option (C): The pears are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the pears are less expensive than the oranges, and the mangoes are less expensive than the kiwis. If the pears were the second-cheapest, then the mangoes would have to be the second-most expensive. However, we know that the plums are the second-most expensive, which means the mangoes cannot be the second-cheapest. We can eliminate option (C).\n\nNow let's consider option (D): The mangoes are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the mangoes are less expensive than the kiwis, and the loquats are more expensive than the apples. If the mangoes were the second-cheapest, then the loquats would have to be the second-most expensive. However, we know that the plums are the second-most expensive, which means the loquats cannot be the second-cheapest. We can eliminate option (D).\n\nFinally, let's look at option (E): The apples are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the loquats are more expensive than the apples, and the plums are the second-most expensive. If the apples were the second-cheapest, then the plums would have to be the second-most expensive. However, we know that the mangoes are the second-most expensive, which means the plums cannot be the second-cheapest. We can eliminate option (E).\n\nThat leaves us with option (F): The oranges are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the pears are less expensive than the oranges, and the mangoes are less expensive than the kiwis. If the oranges were the second-cheapest, then the mangoes would have to be the second-most expensive. However, we know that the plums are the second-most expensive, which means the mangoes cannot be the second-cheapest. We can eliminate option (F).\n\nThat leaves us with option (G): The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nWe know that the loquats are more expensive than the apples, and the plums are the second-most expensive. If the loquats were the second-cheapest, then the plums would have to be the second-most expensive. This is consistent with the given information, so option (G) is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (G) The loquats are the second-cheapest.",

The apples and peaches must be the two most expensive fruits, but we don't know which is more expensive.\n4. The loquats must be the third-cheapest fruit.\n\nNow, we can use the given information to try and determine the order of the remaining fruits. We know that the apples are more expensive than the oranges, so the apples must come after the oranges in the list.

This is not correct because the apples are more expensive than the oranges, but the watermelons are listed as being cheaper than the oranges.\n\n(C) If the oranges are the second-cheapest, then the order would be: plum, watermelon, orange, apple, loquat, peach, kiwi.

If we find a contradiction, we will eliminate that option and try again with a new assumption.\n\nLet's start with option (A): The watermelons are the second-cheapest.\n\nIf the watermelons are the second-cheapest, then the only fruit that could be cheaper than them is the cheapest fruit. Since there are seven fruits, and the watermelons are the second-cheapest, the cheapest fruit must be one of the remaining five fruits: oranges, mangoes, cantaloupes, kiwis, or pears.\n\nHowever, we know that the pears are the second-cheapest, so if the watermelons are the second-cheapest, then the pears cannot be the cheapest fruit. This contradicts the assumption that the cheapest fruit is one of the remaining five fruits. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.\n\nNow let's try option (B): The oranges are the second-cheapest.\n\nIf the oranges are the second-cheapest, then the only fruit that could be cheaper than them is the cheapest fruit. Since there are seven fruits, and the oranges are the second-cheapest, the cheapest fruit must be one of the remaining five fruits: mangoes, cantaloupes, kiwis, pears, or peaches.\n\nHowever, we know that the pears are the second-cheapest, so if the oranges are the second-cheapest, then the pears cannot be the cheapest fruit. This contradicts the assumption that the cheapest fruit is one of the remaining five fruits. Therefore, option (B) is also incorrect.\n\nWe can continue this process for each of the remaining options, but let's try a different approach. Let's look for a pattern in the information given in the problem.\n\nWe know that:\n\n* The pears are the second-cheapest.\n* The peaches are more expensive than the cantaloupes.\n* The peaches are less expensive than the mangoes.\n* The cantaloupes are more expensive than the kiwis.\n* The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.\n* The watermelons are the second-most expensive.\n\nFrom this information, we can see that the pears, peaches, cantaloupes, kiwis, and oranges are arranged in increasing order of expense. The only fruit left is the watermelon, which must be the second-cheapest because it is the second-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (F): The pears are the second-cheapest.",
