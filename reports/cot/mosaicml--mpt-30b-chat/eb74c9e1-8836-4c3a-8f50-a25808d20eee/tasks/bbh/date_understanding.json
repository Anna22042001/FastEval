If it were June, then the answer would be (E) or (F). However, since the question states that May 6, 1992 is like yesterday to Jane, we can assume that it is currently May.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the current month is May, and the current year must be after 1992 but before 2095 (since option (A) is the only future date among the choices).\n\nStep 4: We can eliminate options (B) and (C) because they are from the past.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, the answer must be either (D) or (E).
