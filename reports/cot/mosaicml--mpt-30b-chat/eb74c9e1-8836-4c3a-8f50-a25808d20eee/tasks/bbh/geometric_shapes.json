The second sub-path moves from the point (14, 40) back to the point (50, 40).\n\nThe \"A\" command in the path data specifies an elliptical arc. The first set of numbers after the \"A\" command, \"18.00,18.00\", represents the radii of the large and small arcs of the ellipse. The second set of numbers, \"0.00 1,0\", represents the rotation angle of the ellipse, which is 0 degrees.\n\nSince the path data contains two sub-paths that form a closed shape, and the \"A\" command specifies an elliptical arc, the answer is (G) pentagon.\n\nThe final answer is: G",

Then it draws an arc of radius `18.09` with a rotation angle of `18.09` around point `(90.25, 65.20)` in the counter-clockwise direction. The arc spans an angle of `338.71` degrees, and after drawing the arc, it moves to point `(74.58, 72.62)`. Finally, it draws a straight line back to the starting point `(75.62, 54.56)`.\n\nBased on this path description, we can see that it is not a straight line, nor a simple curve. It starts with a straight line, then it draws an arc, and finally it ends with a straight line. The arc is not a full circle, as it only spans `338.71` degrees, and the starting and ending points are not on the same circle.

Therefore, we can rule out options (A), (B), (C), (F), and (H).\n\nThe path does not form a kite, as a kite has two pairs of adjacent sides that are parallel, but the path starts with a straight line and ends with a straight line, and the arc is not a full circle. Therefore, we can rule out option (D).\n\nThe path does not form a sector, as a sector is a part of a circle, but the path starts with a straight line, ends with a straight line, and the arc is not a full circle. Therefore, we can rule out option (I).\n\nThe path does not form a rectangle, as a rectangle has four right angles, but the path starts with a straight line, ends with a straight line, and the arc is not a full circle. Therefore, we can rule out option (H).\n\nThe path forms a triangle, as it starts and ends with straight lines, and the arc connects the two straight lines. The arc is not a full circle, but it spans `338.71` degrees, which is more than 180 degrees, so the triangle is not a straight triangle. Therefore, the answer is (J).",
