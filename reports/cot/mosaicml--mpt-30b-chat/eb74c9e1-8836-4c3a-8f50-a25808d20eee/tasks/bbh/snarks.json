            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (B) \"Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe.\"\n\nThis is sarcastic because the speaker is using exaggerated language to express their disagreement with the idea that a bike is unsafe because of a significant amount of wobbling. The use of the word \"enough\" suggests that the speaker believes that the wobbling should be considered a serious problem, not just a minor issue. The phrase \"wasn't enough\" also implies that the speaker thinks the bike is unsafe, despite the wobbling. Overall, the sarcastic tone of the statement is meant to convey the speaker's frustration with the idea that the bike is considered safe despite its significant flaws.",

In statement A, the word \"useless\" implies that the space junk is not serving a purpose, but the phrase \"literally just because he can\" suggests that the person is acting without regard for the consequences. This creates a contradiction, as the person is portrayed as acting maliciously but also as acting without consideration for the impact of their actions.\n\nStep 3: In statement B, the phrase \"what a brilliant person\" is used sarcastically to contrast with the negative connotation of \"leaving useless space junk in orbit.\" The word \"brilliant\" is not typically used to describe the creation of space junk, and the phrase \"literally just because he can\" suggests that the person is acting recklessly, which is not typically considered a brilliant action.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, statement B is the sarcastic statement.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (B) \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier.\"\n\nSarcasm is a form of speech that is used to convey the opposite of what is actually being said. In this case, the statement \"it is much easier\" is used to suggest that something is easy when it is actually difficult or impossible. The phrase \"have you tried\" is often used to suggest that someone is being naive or unrealistic in their expectations, which is also a characteristic of sarcasm. Therefore, the statement (B) is sarcastic.",

            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (B) \"Showing up for work everyday alone makes you a great lawmaker.\"\n\nThis is sarcastic because the statement is contradicting the idea that simply showing up to work every day is not enough to be a great lawmaker. It implies that just showing up to work is not a significant contribution to being a great lawmaker and that there are other factors that are necessary to achieve this status.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Both statements are potentially sarcastic, but they have different meanings.\n\nStatement A is using the word \"just\" to minimize the seriousness of memeing about being racist. The use of the word \"okay\" suggests that the speaker does not see any problem with this behavior. However, the word \"racist\" is still being used in a negative context, so it is unclear if the speaker actually believes that memeing about racism is acceptable.\n\nStatement B, on the other hand, is using the word \"just\" to imply that memeing about being racist is not a serious issue. The word \"toxic\" suggests that the speaker believes that this behavior is harmful. However, the word \"memeing\" suggests that the speaker is making a lighthearted or humorous comment about the topic.\n\nStep 2: Based on the above analysis, it is difficult to determine which statement is sarcastic without additional context.\n\nAnswer: (C) Neither statement is sarcastic.",

            "model_answer": "The sarcastic statement is (B) Nobody can be successful without having inherited all their money first.\n\nThe reason for this is that the statement is contradicting itself. The word \"nobody\" implies that it is a universal statement, and the word \"successful\" implies that it is a positive statement. However, the statement is saying that it is impossible to be successful without inheriting all your money first, which is a negative statement. Therefore, the statement is sarcastic because it is saying the opposite of what it appears to be saying.\n\nThe answer is (B).",
