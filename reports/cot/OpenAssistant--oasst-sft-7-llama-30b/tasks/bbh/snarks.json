This unexpected twist could potentially be ironic, and the use of the phrase \"trying to help kids in need\" could potentially be used sarcastically.\n\nGiven the information provided, the sarcastic statement is (B) He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.",

In (B), the question \"Have you tried not being rude?\" is also phrased in a way that suggests it is simple or easy to not be rude.\n\nStep 3: Consider the tone of each statement. Statement (A) has a tone that is dismissive of poverty and suggests that it is something that can be easily fixed if people would just try not to be poor. This attitude is a common response to poverty, but it is not a realistic or helpful one. Statement (B) also has a dismissive tone, but it is not as explicit in that dismissal. The tone of (A) is more sarcastic than the tone of (B).\n\nStep 4: Consider the implications of each statement. Statement (A) suggests that poverty is a personal choice, which could be used to blame the poor for their own circumstances and shift the focus away from systematic issues that contribute to poverty. This is a harmful attitude. Statement (B) doesn't make this same implication.\n\nStep 5: Consider the context in which each statement would be used. Statement (A) would be more likely to be used sarcastically in response to an argument that poverty is the fault of the poor, whereas (B) might not be used in that context.\n\nStep 6: Take all of the above into consideration when deciding which",

The second statement, (B), \"Yes, the game is over after the first half\", is more likely to be sarcastic because it seems like an exaggerated or unlikely claim.
