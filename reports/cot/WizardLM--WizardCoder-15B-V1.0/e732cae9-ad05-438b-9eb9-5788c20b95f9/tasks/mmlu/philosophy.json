            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) Neuroscience: Neuroscience is a field of study that focuses on the structure and function of the human brain. It is widely accepted that the human brain is responsible for many aspects of our behavior, including emotions, reasoning, and decision-making. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that psychological egoism is based on neuroscience.\r\n\r\n(B) Controlled studies: Psychological egoism is often based on controlled studies, which involve observing individuals and examining their behavior and thoughts. This is because psychological egoism is often associated with a personality trait that is difficult to control, such as impulsivity or insecurity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that psychological egoism is based on controlled studies.\r\n\r\n(C) Interviews and surveys: Psychological egoism is often based on interviews and surveys, which involve observing individuals and asking them questions about their thoughts and behavior. This is because psychological egoism is often associated with a personality trait that is difficult to control, such as impulsivity or insecurity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that psychological egoism is based on interviews and surveys.\r\n\r\n(D) Nonempirical in character: Psychological egoism is often nonempirical in character, which means that it is not based on empirical research. This is because psychological egoism is often associated with a personality trait that is difficult to control, such as impulsivity or insecurity. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that psychological egoism is nonempirical in character.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B) Controlled studies.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nBaier\u2019s theory is based on the idea that morality is a social construct that is based on the social contract. The social contract is a set of rules that are agreed upon by all members of a society. These rules define the acceptable and unacceptable behavior of individuals within the society.\r\n\r\nThe first step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible is to determine whether it violates any of the social contract rules. If it does, then it is not morally permissible.\r\n\r\nIf the action is not forbidden by the social contract, then the second step is to determine whether the social contract rule is a genuine moral rule. A genuine moral rule is a rule that is based on a moral principle that is not based on a personal preference.\r\n\r\nIf the social contract rule is not a genuine moral rule, then the third step is to determine whether the action is forbidden by a law. A law is a set of rules that are enacted by a government or other institution to ensure that certain behaviors are acceptable within a society.\r\n\r\nIf the action is not forbidden by a law, then the final step is to determine whether one can approve of the action. One can only approve of an action if it is consistent with the social contract and the law.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) whether the moral rule forbidding it is a genuine moral rule.",
