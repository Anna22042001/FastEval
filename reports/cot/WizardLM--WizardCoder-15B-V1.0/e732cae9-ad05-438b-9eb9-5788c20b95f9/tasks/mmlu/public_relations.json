            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nMikhail Bakhtin is a Russian philosopher who is known for his philosophy on the role of communication in creating a well-informed public. He argues that in order to create a well-informed public, all communication about an issue must be intelligently and effectively communicated. \r\n\r\nAccording to Bakhtin, intelligently and effectively communicating involves using language that is clear, concise, and easy to understand. This involves using language that is appropriate for the audience, and that is not misleading or inappropriate. \r\n\r\nIn order to create a well-informed public, Bakhtin argues that all communication about an issue must be democratic. This means that all participants in the public must be able to contribute their ideas and opinions, and that the ideas and opinions must be heard and considered. \r\n\r\nDemocratic communication also involves using language that is accessible to all, and that is not exclusive to a particular group of people. This means that Bakhtin argues that all participants in the public must be able to communicate their ideas and opinions in a way that is respectful and inclusive. \r\n\r\nFinally, Bakhtin argues that all communication about an issue must be dialogic, or take the form of a dialogue. This means that the communication must be interactive and conversational, and that it must involve multiple participants and multiple perspectives. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) democracy, dialogic.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) Audiences are more vulnerable and passive than ever before.\r\n\r\nThis is a false premise. Audiences are not passive recipients of media messages. Rather, they are the primary recipients of media messages. Their reception of messages is influenced by their perceptions of the message, their cultural background, and their social context. Audiences are also not immune to manipulation.\r\n\r\n(B) Television viewing, in particular, creates increased activity in the right hemisphere of the brain.\r\n\r\nThis is a false premise. Television viewing is not a sufficient cause for increased activity in the right hemisphere of the brain. The right hemisphere is involved in a wide range of cognitive processes, including memory, attention, and decision-making. Television viewing may increase activity in the right hemisphere, but it is not the sole cause.\r\n\r\n(C) Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\r\n\r\nThis is a false premise. Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages. Their reception of messages is influenced by their perceptions of the message, their cultural background, and their social context. Active receivers may be more likely to engage in conversation, but they may also be more likely to seek out and engage in other forms of communication, such as face-to-face interactions or online forums.\r\n\r\n(D) Technology has led to increasingly passive recipients at the ends of message transmission systems.\r\n\r\nThis is a false premise. Technology has not led to increasingly passive recipients at the ends of message transmission systems. The transmission of messages is a complex process that involves multiple factors, including the physical medium, the message content, and the transmission channel. The end points of message transmission systems may be more vulnerable to manipulation, but they are not the sole cause.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (B)",
