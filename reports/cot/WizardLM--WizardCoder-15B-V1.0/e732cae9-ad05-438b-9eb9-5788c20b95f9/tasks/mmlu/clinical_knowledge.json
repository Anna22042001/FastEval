            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe left ventricle is the region of the heart that is closest to the atria. The atria are the two major blood vessels that connect the left ventricle to the rest of the heart. The contractions of the atria cause the blood to flow through the vessels and the heart muscle.\r\n\r\nThe contractions of the atria can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides. However, the most common cause of atrial contractions is the increased pressure in the left ventricle caused by the increased blood flow from the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nThe right ventricle is the region of the heart that is farthest from the atria. The right ventricle is relaxed and contracts less frequently than the left ventricle. The relaxation of the right ventricle can be caused by a variety of factors, including the passage of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, the decrease in blood flow from the heart muscle, or the decrease in the level of oxygen in the blood.\r\n\r\nThe arteries are the blood vessels that connect the left ventricle to the rest of the body. The contractions of the arteries can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides. However, the most common cause of arterial contractions is the increased pressure in the heart muscle caused by the increased blood flow from the atria.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle because the atria are contracting, the vessels are contracted, the right ventricle is relaxed, and the arteries have elastic recoil.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (B)",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nGraves disease is a disease of the thyroid gland. It is a genetic disease that causes the thyroid gland to become inflamed and swollen. The inflammation can cause the thyroid gland to produce abnormal enzymes that can cause damage to the nervous system. Graves disease can be caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor (TSHR) gene.\r\n\r\nThe thyroid gland is located in the upper part of the body and is responsible for regulating body temperature, hormones, and the immune system. Graves disease is a common condition that affects males more than females.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Graves disease caused 'Derbyshire Neck' which is a rare neurological disorder that affects the nerves of the neck.

The nerve stimulus can be removed by applying pressure or withdrawing the muscle.\r\n\r\nB. The nerve stimulus is too forceful. This means that the nerve is overloading the muscle, causing it to contract too quickly. This can be caused by a high level of stress on the muscle, or by the nerve stimulus being too strong.\r\n\r\nC. The actin binding sites are uncovered. This means that the muscle fibre is not fully engaged in the actin network. This can be caused by a breakdown of the actin network, or by the muscle fibre being unable to bind to the actin network.\r\n\r\nD. The actin binding sites are saturated. This means that the muscle fibre is fully engaged in the actin network.
