            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nInduction heating takes place in conducting materials. Conducting materials are those that have a high electrical resistance and can conduct electricity. Therefore, conducting materials are the only materials that can be used for induction heating.\r\n\r\nConducting materials can be classified into two types: conducting but non-magnetic materials and conducting and magnetic materials. Conducting but non-magnetic materials are those that have a high electrical resistance but do not have any magnetic properties. These materials are commonly used in electronics, lighting, and other non-magnetic applications.\r\n\r\nConducting and magnetic materials are those that have both high electrical resistance and magnetic properties. These materials are commonly used in electrical appliances, such as washing machines, air conditioners, and refrigerators.\r\n\r\nInsulating materials are those that have a low electrical resistance and can conduct electricity. These materials are commonly used in insulation and heat transfer applications.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magentic materials.",

The type of network depends on the nature of the circuit. If the circuit is a low-pass filter, then it is an LC network. If the circuit is a high-pass filter, then it is an RC network. If the circuit is a band-pass filter, then it is an RL network. However, it is possible for a circuit to have both a low-pass and high-pass filter at the same time, which would make it an RC network.

We are also given that the metal surface is enclosed in a 10 m side cube.\r\n\r\nThe total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is the sum of the electric field due to the metal surface and the electric field due to the cube.\r\n\r\nThe electric field due to the metal surface is given by the Coulomb's law:\r\n\r\nE = kq/r^2\r\n\r\nwhere E is the electric field, k is the Coulomb constant, q is the surface charge density, and r is the distance from the center of the surface to the point of observation.\r\n\r\nFor a metal surface, the distance from the center of the surface to the point of observation is equal to the radius of the surface. Therefore,\r\n\r\nE = kq/r^2 = kq/1^2 = 20q\r\n\r\nThe electric field due to the cube is given by the Faraday's law:\r\n\r\nE = -dQ/dr\r\n\r\nwhere dQ is the change in electric charge, and r is the distance from the center of the cube to the point of observation.\r\n\r\nFor a cube, the distance from the center of the cube to the point of observation is equal to half of the side length. Therefore,\r\n\r\nE = -dQ/dr = -dQ/(10/2) = -dQ/5\r\n\r\nTherefore, the total electric field due to the metal surface and the cube is:\r\n\r\nE = 20q - dQ/5\r\n\r\nThe electric field normal to the surface of the cube is perpendicular to the surface of the cube.
