We can use the molarity of propane (mol/g) to do this. \n\nmol/g = 1 mol/L\n\nwhere L is the volume of the propane. \n\nSince the volume of propane is not given, we can assume it is 1 L. \n\nTherefore, \n\nmol/g = 1 mol/L = 1 mol/1 L = 1 mol\n\nNow, we can use the molarity of propane to convert the given mass of propane to moles of propane. \n\nmoles of propane = mass of propane / molarity of propane\n\nTherefore, \n\nmoles of propane = 6.2 g / 1 mol\n\nmoles of propane = 6.2 g / 1 mol = 6.2 g\n\nTherefore, there are 6.2 g of propane in 1 mole of propane. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe bond length between any two nonmetal atoms is determined by the attraction and repulsion forces between the two atoms. The attraction force is the force that the two atoms exert on each other, and the repulsion force is the force that the two atoms exert on each other. The bond length is the distance between the two atoms where these forces balance each other.\r\n\r\nIn the case of nonmetallic atoms, the attraction and repulsion forces are usually stronger than in metallic atoms. This is because the electrons in nonmetallic atoms are free to move around, whereas in metallic atoms, the electrons are confined to specific orbitals. Therefore, the attraction and repulsion forces between nonmetallic atoms are stronger than in metallic atoms.\r\n\r\nThe point at which the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are equal is called the equilibrium bond length. This is the point where the two atoms have the same electronegativity, i.e., the same number of electrons in their nuclei.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the bond length between any two nonmetal atoms is achieved under the condition where the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are equal. This is the case where the point at which the attractive and repulsive forces between the two atoms are equal is the equilibrium bond length.",

This means that the reaction proceeds in a single step, with no intermediate products. The half-life of SO2Cl2 is the time it takes for the reaction to reduce the concentration of the reactants to zero.\r\n\r\nIf the reaction is first-order, then the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reactants. Therefore, increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2 will increase the rate of reaction, which will increase the half-life.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs will also increase the rate of reaction, but it will not necessarily increase the half-life. This is because the reaction is temperature-independent, and the rate of reaction is determined solely by the concentration of the reactants.\r\n\r\nDecreasing the overall pressure in the container will also increase the rate of reaction, but it will not necessarily increase the half-life.
