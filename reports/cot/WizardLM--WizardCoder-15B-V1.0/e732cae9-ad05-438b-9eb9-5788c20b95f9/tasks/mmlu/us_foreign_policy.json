            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\r\n\r\nThis is because free trade is a cost-effective way to trade goods and services, but it also creates a lot of problems for both countries. For one, it can lead to economic instability and conflict. For example, if one country exports a product that is not competitive with its imports, it can cause a crisis in the market and damage the economy.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that free trade can also create a lot of inequality. For example, if one country exports a product that is cheaper than its imports, it can lead to a situation where the country with the higher import price has a larger share of the market. This can result in a worse economic situation for all involved.\r\n\r\nTo solve these problems, governments can adopt policies that encourage trade and reduce trade barriers. For example, governments can encourage foreign investment and reduce the costs of foreign aid. However, these policies can also have unintended consequences, such as encouraging investment in sectors that are not profitable or reducing foreign investment in sectors that are already well-established.\r\n\r\nOverall, free trade is a cost-effective way to trade goods and services, but it also creates a lot of problems for both countries. Governments can try to address these problems by adopting policies that encourage trade and reduce trade barriers, but this may not always be possible or effective.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) The soft power of the United States would allow it to avoid decline.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nKennedy argues that the United States has been a soft power for decades. He argues that the soft power of the United States allowed it to avoid decline in the economy and that this was due to the soft power of the country. The soft power of the country allowed the United States to maintain its position as the world's most powerful economy.\r\n\r\nKennedy also argues that the rise of Japan had been exaggerated. He argues that Japan had been a soft power for decades, but that the soft power had been exaggerated by the US. The US had been able to maintain its position as the world's most powerful economy, which meant that it had been able to maintain its soft power. However, the rise of Japan had been exaggerated because the US had been able to maintain its soft power and not let it decline.",
