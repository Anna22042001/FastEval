The land was subject to a $24,000 mortgage, which was assumed by Ace. No other liabilities existed at the time of the contribution. \r\n\r\nTo calculate the basis in Ace, we need to consider the interest rate paid by Ace. Since Ace paid a 25% interest, we can assume that the interest rate paid by Ace is 25% of the fair market value of the land. \r\n\r\nUsing the formula for the basis of a loan, we can calculate the basis in Ace as follows:\r\n\r\nBasis in Ace = (Fair Market Value of Land * (1 - Interest Rate Paid by Ace)) / (1 - (Mortgage Amount / Fair Market Value of Land))\r\n\r\nSubstituting the values given, we get:\r\n\r\nBasis in Ace = ($50,000 * (1 - 0.25)) / (1 - ($24,000 / $50,000))\r\n\r\nSimplifying:\r\n\r\nBasis in Ace = $32,000 / 0.75\r\n\r\nTherefore, the basis in Ace is $32,000. \r\n\r\nAnswer: (B) $16,000",
