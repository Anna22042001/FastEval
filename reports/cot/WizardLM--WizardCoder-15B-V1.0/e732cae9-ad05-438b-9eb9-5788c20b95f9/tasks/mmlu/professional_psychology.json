            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) may produce its effects by promoting the release of endogenous opiates-dorphins)\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Endogenous opiates-dorphins are not released by electrical stimulation of the brain. They are released by the body's natural endogenous pain-producing mechanisms. Electrical stimulation of the brain only affects the release of neurotransmitters, which are not endogenous to the body.\r\n\r\n(B) may produce its effects by promoting the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine\r\n\r\nThis is correct. Electrical stimulation of the brain can promote the release of norepinephrine, which is a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of pain perception and motor control.\r\n\r\n(C) is generally effective, but medically ill-advised because such stimulation has aversive properties\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect. Electrical stimulation of the brain is generally effective for treating chronic pain.
