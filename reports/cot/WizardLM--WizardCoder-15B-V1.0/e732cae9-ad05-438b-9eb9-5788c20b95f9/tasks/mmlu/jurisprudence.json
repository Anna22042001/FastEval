            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nRobert Nozick's formula is r x H, where r is the effectiveness of rehabilitation and H is the hazard to the community. This formula is used to determine the appropriate punishment for a defendant who has committed a crime. The formula is based on the idea that the more effective the rehabilitation, the lesser the hazard to the community.\r\n\r\nThe formula is used to calculate the severity of punishment based on the severity of the crime and the degree of humiliation of the defendant. The severity of punishment is determined by multiplying the effectiveness of rehabilitation with the degree of humiliation.\r\n\r\nIf the effectiveness of rehabilitation is high, the defendant is likely to be rehabilitated and the hazard to the community is low. In this case, the severity of punishment is low.\r\n\r\nIf the effectiveness of rehabilitation is low, the defendant is likely to be persecuted and the hazard to the community is high. In this case, the severity of punishment is high.\r\n\r\nThe formula is also used to determine the appropriate punishment for a defendant who has committed a crime. If the defendant has a low degree of humiliation, the risk of violence is low and the defendant's history is not relevant. In this case, the severity of punishment is low.\r\n\r\nIf the defendant has a high degree of humiliation, the risk of violence is high and the defendant's history is relevant. In this case, the severity of punishment is high.\r\n\r\nThe formula is also used to determine the appropriate punishment for a defendant who has committed a crime. If the defendant has a low degree of humiliation and a low risk of violence, the recidivism rate is low and the defendant's history is not relevant. In this case, the severity of punishment is low.\r\n\r\nIf the defendant has a high degree of humiliation and a high risk of violence, the recidivism rate is high and the defendant's history is relevant. In this case, the severity of punishment is high.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\nThe correct answer is (B) Extent of responsibility multiplied by actual harm done.",
