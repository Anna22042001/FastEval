            "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe legal concept invoked by the patient is \"collateral estoppel,\" which means that the plaintiff is relying on the negligence of the patient to avoid paying for the sponge. This is because the patient has a right to the sponge, which is a collateral damage that could have occurred without her consent. \r\n\r\nHowever, the patient has not been informed of the legal issue and has not been given the opportunity to opt out of the sponge. Therefore, the plaintiff is relying on the negligence of the patient to avoid paying for the sponge. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (A) collateral estoppel.",

            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dizziness for 6 weeks. When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n(A) Cardiac stress scintigraphy\n(B) Adjusting her medication regimen\n(C) Warfarin therapy\n(D) Transesophageal echocardiography",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe patient is experiencing symptoms of dizziness and light-headedness. This suggests that there is a problem with the heart. The patient's blood pressure is elevated in the right arm and left arm, which suggests that there is a problem with the arteries. The patient's pulse is low, which suggests that there is a problem with the respiratory system. The patient's ECG shows sinus bradycardia, which suggests that there is a problem with the cardiac arrhythmia. The patient's neurologic examination shows no focal findings, which suggests that there is no problem with the brain. The patient's carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery, which suggests that there is a problem with the vertebral artery. \r\n\r\nBased on the symptoms and the medical history, the most appropriate next step in management would be to cardiac stress scintigraphy. This would involve taking a series of X-rays of the heart and analyzing them to identify any abnormalities. If the abnormalities are found to be consistent with heart failure, then the patient would be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. \r\n\r\nIf the patient's symptoms improve after cardiac stress scintigraphy, then the medication regimen can be adjusted. This would involve reviewing the medications currently being taken and adjusting them as necessary. If the patient is still experiencing symptoms of dizziness and light-headedness, then the next step would be to consider warfarin therapy. This would involve administering a high dose of warfarin to the patient over a period of time to treat the symptoms. \r\n\r\nIf the patient's symptoms do not improve with warfarin therapy, then transesophageal echocardiography can be performed. This would involve inserting a transesophageal echocardiogram into the patient's chest and observing the heart's response to the echocardiogram. If the patient's heart is not responsive to the echocardiogram, then further evaluation would be needed. \r\n\r\nThe final answer is D - Transesophageal echocardiography.",
