            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) James-Lange. \r\n\r\nThis is because James-Lange is a theory of emotions that explains the sudden jumping out of people towards Antoinette's apartment. James-Lange states that people are experiencing a \"cannon-bard\" emotion, which is a negative emotion that comes from a fear of being caught in a trap. James-Lange also states that the \"cannon-bard\" emotion is a result of the sudden surprise party, which is a positive emotion that comes from a sense of excitement and happiness. Therefore, James-Lange is the best theory of emotions to explain the sudden jumping out of people towards Antoinette's apartment.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nArousal is a physiological response to stimuli that causes the body to move towards a state of alertness, excitement, or emotional response. It is a complex process that involves multiple neural and hormonal systems working together to produce a wide range of physiological responses. \r\n\r\nDilation of the pupils is a characteristic of arousal that occurs when the pupils dilate to a larger size, causing the eyes to focus on the surrounding environment. This can be a sign of alertness, interest, or curiosity. \r\n\r\nIncrease in salivation is a characteristic of arousal that occurs when the skin becomes more salty, causing the body to feel hot and dry. This can be a sign of stress or dehydration. \r\n\r\nIncrease in perspiration is a characteristic of arousal that occurs when the skin becomes more perspiring, causing the body to sweat. This can be a sign of exercise or stress. \r\n\r\nIncrease in secretion of stress hormones is a characteristic of arousal that occurs when the body produces more stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline. This can be a sign of depression or anxiety. \r\n\r\nTherefore, none of the above are characteristic of physiological arousal. \r\n\r\nAnswer: (D)",

Implicit memory is a type of memory that is formed without conscious awareness. It is a memory that is not consciously remembered, but is inferred from the events that occur in the past. Engrams are short-term memory traces that are formed in the brain. They are like flashbulb memories, but they are more permanent and last for only a few seconds.

Explicit memory is a type of memory that is formed through conscious awareness and is consciously remembered.\r\n\r\nThe World Trade Center was destroyed is a memory that is implicit in the sense that it is not consciously remembered.

Finally, the left hemisphere is involved in analytical reasoning, which involves the ability to analyze and understand complex problems.\r\n\r\nHowever, the left hemisphere is not dominant for mathematical reasoning.
