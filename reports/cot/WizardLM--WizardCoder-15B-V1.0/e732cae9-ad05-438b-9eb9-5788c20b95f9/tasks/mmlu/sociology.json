Capitalists are not being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority. Rather, they are being replaced by workers who are paid a wage and have the authority to manage their own affairs.\r\n\r\n(B) The affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life: This is a false premise. The affluent working class is not adopting middle class values and ways of life. Rather, they are being replaced by middle class workers who are not paid as highly as the wealthy and have less control over their own affairs.\r\n\r\n(C) White collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace: This is a false premise. The introduction of new technologies into the workplace does not necessarily lead to the deskilling of white collar occupations. Rather, it may lead to the creation of new occupations that are more flexible and adaptable to the changing needs of the modern worker.\r\n\r\n(D) The class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes: This is a false premise. The class structure has not fragmented and there are still distinct social classes.

This can be achieved through acts such as charity, service, or generosity.\r\n\r\n- Value-rational: This type of social action is based on the idea that individuals should act in a way that aligns with their values and beliefs. This can be achieved through acts such as education, political action, or social justice.\r\n\r\n- Traditional: This type of social action is based on the idea that individuals should follow traditional social norms and values. This can be achieved through acts such as conformity, conformity, or traditional values.\r\n\r\n- Effective: This type of social action is based on the idea that individuals should be able to make positive contributions to society. This can be achieved through acts such as volunteering, donating, or serving in a military unit.\r\n\r\nBased on these four types of social action, Weber concluded that the ideal type of social action is instrumentally-rational.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nA) Patterns of drug use in Britain reveal that it has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture. This is because the drug use has increased significantly over the past decade, with the number of drug users in Britain increasing from 1.5 million in 2000 to 2.5 million in 2019. This increase is particularly significant in the teenage demographic, which has been the target of many drug addiction scandals.\r\n\r\nB) The most commonly used recreational drug in Britain is Ecstasy. This is because it is widely available and can be easily consumed by anyone, regardless of age or gender. It is also known for its sedative and relaxing properties, making it a popular choice for people of all ages.\r\n\r\nC) Teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This is because teenage girls are often more introverted and less confident, which can make it harder for them to make risky decisions. Additionally, teenage girls are often more likely to have a romantic interest in drugs, which can make them more likely to try new drugs.\r\n\r\nD) Despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare in Britain. This is because the legalization of drugs has been a slow process, and many drugs are still illegal or under legal review. Additionally, the use of drugs is often associated with addiction, which can lead to severe consequences for those who use them.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B)",
