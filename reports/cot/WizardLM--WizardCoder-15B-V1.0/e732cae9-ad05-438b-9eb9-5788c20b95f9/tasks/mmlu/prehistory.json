            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nLevallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes. This is because Levallois technology was a system of tools and techniques that involved the creation of pottery, clothing, and other objects. The core tools were the basic building blocks of Levallois technology, such as the mortar and pestle, which were used to create the flakes. The flakes were then used to create pottery, clothing, and other objects.\r\n\r\nThe shift in emphasis from producing pottery to producing clothing is because Levallois technology was a system of tools and techniques that involved the creation of pottery, clothing, and other objects. The pottery was the primary product of Levallois technology, and it was used to create clothing and other objects.\r\n\r\nThe shift in emphasis from producing arrows to producing spear points is because Levallois technology was a system of tools and techniques that involved the creation of arrows and other objects. The arrows were the primary product of Levallois technology, and they were used to create spear points and other objects.\r\n\r\nThe shift in emphasis from larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones is because Levallois technology was a system of tools and techniques that involved the creation of larger, duller axes and other objects.
