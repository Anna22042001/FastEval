            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) script theory. \r\n\r\nScript theory is a theory that explains the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour. It uses the concept of \"script\" to explain the effects of erotica. A script is a set of instructions or a set of rules that a person follows to achieve certain goals. In script theory, the effects of erotica on a person's behaviour are explained by the person's actions and attitudes towards the erotic content. \r\n\r\nScript theory uses the term \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of erotica on a person's behaviour. Modelling refers to the act of creating a model of someone's behaviour based on their actions and attitudes. Imitation refers to the act of copying someone else's actions and attitudes. By imitating someone else's actions and attitudes, a person can learn to behave in a similar way and develop a similar set of skills. \r\n\r\nScript theory is a powerful theory that explains the effects of erotica on a person's behaviour. It uses the concept of \"script\" to explain the effects of erotica and the effects of imitation and modelling on a person's behaviour. By understanding the effects of erotica on a person's behaviour, script theory can help people to develop a better understanding of themselves and their relationship with others.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe inner lining of the uterus is the lining that surrounds the lining of the bladder. It is responsible for the shed skin and the formation of the uterine lining. The inner lining is shed during the menstrual cycle, which is when the uterus produces the hormone progesterone. The hormone progesterone is released from the uterus and causes the lining of the inner lining to shed. This is why the inner lining is referred to as the shedding of the inner lining of the uterus.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B) Ovulation",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) proliferation. \r\n\r\nReasoning: \r\n\r\nSperm are most hospitable during preovulation, which is the period of sperm production before ovulation. During this period, sperm are attracted to the egg and are able to move around the body. However, during proliferation, sperm are attracted to each other and are able to form a colony. This can lead to a decrease in sperm production and can cause problems with sperm quality. Therefore, proliferation is the most hospitable environment for sperm passage.",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe question asks what seems to be the case when the folk saying \"opposites attract\" (i.e., dissimilar attitudes tend to cause liking) when it is considered in light of current research. This is a complex question that requires a deeper understanding of the research and the cultural context in which it was said. \r\n\r\nFirst, it is important to note that the term \"opposites attract\" is not a new term and has been used in various cultures for centuries. It is not clear what the exact meaning of the phrase is, but it is generally understood to mean that people who have different attitudes towards opposite sexualities tend to be attracted to each other. \r\n\r\nSecond, it is important to note that the research on this topic is still ongoing and there is no definitive answer. However, there are several studies that suggest that the phrase \"opposites attract\" is not true in all cultures. \r\n\r\nFor example, in a study conducted in 1996 by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, they found that \"opposites attract\" was not true in the United States. This is because in the US, homosexuals and heterosexuals are often viewed as having the same sexuality and are not attracted to each other. \r\n\r\nIn another study conducted in 2012 by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, they found that \"opposites attract\" was true for women but not for men. This is because men are often viewed as being more \"conventional\" and less \"sophisticated\" than women, and this can lead to a negative association between men and women. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is important to note that the phrase \"opposites attract\" is not always used in the same way. In some cultures, it is used to describe a negative association between people with different sexualities, while in others, it is used to describe a positive association between people with similar sexualities. \r\n\r\nBased on these observations, it seems that the phrase \"opposites attract\" is not always true in all cultures. However, it is still true for some cultures and not true for others. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the cultural context in which it is said and the research being conducted to determine the truth of the phrase. \r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B) It seems to be true for heterosexuals but not for homosexuals.",
