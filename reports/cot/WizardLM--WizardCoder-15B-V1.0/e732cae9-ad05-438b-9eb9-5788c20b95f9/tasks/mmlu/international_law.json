            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality. This is because individuals are not subject to the same legal protections as States and international organisations. Individuals are not subject to the same legal protections as States and international organisations because they are not considered to be natural persons and are not subject to the same legal protections as individuals. Individuals are not natural persons and are not subject to the same legal protections as individuals because they are not considered to be human beings. Therefore, individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Collective rights are those that belong to particular groups as opposed to the individual members of the group. \r\n\r\nReasoning: Collective rights are rights that belong to a group as a whole, not to individual members of the group. For example, a collective right may be the right to vote in a particular election, or the right to organize a protest. Collective rights are distinct from individual rights, which belong to individuals and are not shared by the group as a whole. For example, an individual right may be the right to own property, or the right to vote in a particular election.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The fundamental premise of monist theory is that domestic laws are superior to international laws. This is because domestic laws are more comprehensive and cover a wider range of issues than international laws. Additionally, domestic laws are more likely to be enforced by local courts than international laws, which can result in lesser enforcement costs. Therefore, monist theory posits that domestic laws are the basis for international law.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Goodwin v UK (2002). \r\n\r\nThis case is a good example of the living instrument principle because it involves a human rights case that involves a person's right to life, liberty, and property. The case is also a good example of a case that involves a person's right to freedom of movement and residence. The case also involves a person's right to a fair trial and a right to a fair hearing. The case also involves a person's right to a fair and equitable punishment. Overall, this case demonstrates that the European Court of Human Rights is a living instrument that is committed to upholding human rights and promoting justice for all.",

            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation suggests that all treaties undergo legislative transformation before they become domestic law. This means that the treaties must be amended to conform to the requirements of the new domestic law. This is necessary because the treaties are not yet legally binding in the new country, and they must be transformed into a legal document that is legally binding in the new country. The doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level. It is simply a principle that states that treaties should be amended to conform to the new domestic law.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) The ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory. \r\n\r\nThis is because the accumulation theory is based on the assumption that an armed attack is a single event, not a series of smaller, yet cumulative, instances of armed force. The accumulation theory is a theory that suggests that the armed forces used in a war are not being used in a way that would allow for a single attack to overwhelm the defense. Instead, the theory suggests that the armed forces are being used in a way that allows for multiple smaller instances of armed force to be used in a coordinated manner to overwhelm the defense. \r\n\r\nIn the Nicaragua case, the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory because the armed forces used in the conflict were not being used in a way that would allow for a single attack to overwhelm the defense.
