The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, and is typically denoted as beta.

It is a simple and commonly used model that captures the most commonly used features of financial asset return time-series. \r\n\r\nThe first feature that could be captured using a GARCH(1,1) model is fat tails in the return distribution. This is because the GARCH(1,1) model assumes that the return distribution is normal, which means that it has a bell-shaped curve. This is not the case for all financial assets, but it is common for stocks and bonds.\r\n\r\nThe second feature that could be captured using a GARCH(1,1) model is leverage effects. This is because the GARCH(1,1) model assumes that the return distribution is independent of the leverage factor, which means that the return of an asset with a higher leverage factor will be higher than the return of an asset with a lower leverage factor.\r\n\r\nThe third feature that could be captured using a GARCH(1,1) model is volatility clustering. This is because the GARCH(1,1) model assumes that the volatility of an asset is uncorrelated with the volatility of other assets, which means that the volatility of an asset will not be affected by the volatility of other assets.\r\n\r\nThe fourth feature that could be captured using a GARCH(1,1) model is volatility affecting returns. This is because the GARCH(1,1) model assumes that the volatility of an asset will affect the return of the asset, which means that the return of an asset with a higher volatility will be higher than the return of an asset with a lower volatility.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) (ii) and (iv) only.",

ARCH(q) stands for Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, and GARCH(1,1) stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity with one lag. \r\n\r\nThe main difference between ARCH(q) and GARCH(1,1) is that ARCH(q) is a simpler model that assumes that the conditional variance is not directly affected by previous lags of squared returns, while GARCH(1,1) assumes that the conditional variance is directly affected by the previous lag of squared returns. \r\n\r\nIn other words, ARCH(q) assumes that the variance of the process is not directly affected by previous lags of returns, while GARCH(1,1) assumes that the variance of the process is directly affected by the previous lag of returns. \r\n\r\nThe main advantage of ARCH(q) over GARCH(1,1) is that ARCH(q) is more parsimonious, meaning that it has fewer parameters to estimate. This makes it easier to interpret and analyze the model. \r\n\r\nHowever, ARCH(q) also has some drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is that it is more likely to violate non-negativity constraints. This means that the estimated variance can be negative, which can lead to numerical instability and model misspecification. Another drawback is that the ARCH(q) model can allow for an infinite number of previous lags of squared returns to affect the current conditional variance, which can lead to overfitting and model instability. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, GARCH(1,1) is a more complex model that assumes that the conditional variance is directly affected by the previous lag of squared returns. This makes it more powerful and flexible than ARCH(q), but it also requires more parameters to estimate. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (D) GARCH(1,1) is the more suitable model for modeling financial time series, as it is more flexible and powerful than ARCH(q) and can capture all of the dependence in the conditional variance.",
