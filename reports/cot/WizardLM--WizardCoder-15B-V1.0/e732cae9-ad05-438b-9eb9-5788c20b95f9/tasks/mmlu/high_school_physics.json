            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe electron beam has a speed of 10^7 m/s, which means it will travel a distance of 10^7 m in a second. Therefore, the magnetic field of the Earth will cause the electrons to bend around the beam. The strength of the magnetic field is 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T, which means that the magnetic field will cause the electrons to bend in a circular path.\r\n\r\nTo find the radius of the circle, we need to consider the magnetic field strength and the speed of the electron beam. The magnetic field strength will cause the electrons to bend in a circular path, so we can use the law of conservation of angular momentum to find the radius of the circle.\r\n\r\nThe law of conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum of a system is constant. Therefore, the total angular momentum of the electron beam will remain constant as it bends around the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe radius of the circle is equal to the magnitude of the total angular momentum divided by the product of the electron speed and the magnetic field strength.\r\n\r\nSubstituting the values given, we get:\r\n\r\nL = mvR = (10^7)(5 \u00d7 10^-5)(10^7) = 5 \u00d7 10^-5 \u00d7 10^14 J m = 5 \u00d7 10^-5 \u00d7 10^14 N m\r\n\r\nR = L / (mv) = (5 \u00d7 10^-5 \u00d7 10^14) / (10^7)(5 \u00d7 10^-5) = 10^-14 m\r\n\r\nTherefore, the radius of the circle is approximately 10^-14 m.\r\n\r\nAnswer: (B) 1 \u03bcm",

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nA sonic motion detector measures the acceleration of an object by detecting the sound waves produced by the object. The net force applied to the object is proportional to the acceleration. Therefore, the slope of the graph is directly proportional to the acceleration.\r\n\r\nThe slope of the graph is directly measured using the following equation:\r\n\r\nslope = change in y / change in x\r\n\r\nwhere y is the acceleration and x is the net force applied to the object.\r\n\r\nSince the slope of the graph is directly proportional to the acceleration, the slope of the graph is directly measured using the acceleration.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(D) Inertial mass is directly measured using the slope of the graph.",
