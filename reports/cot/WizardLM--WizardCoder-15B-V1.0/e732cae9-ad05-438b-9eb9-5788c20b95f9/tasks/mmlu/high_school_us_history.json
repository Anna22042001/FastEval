            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\n\u2014Benjamin Franklin, Examination before Parliament, 1766\nThe policy described most immediately led to\n\n(A) peace between Indian tribes and white settlers.\n(B) the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\n(C) the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\n(D) a negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, by which the tribes were allowed to remain on their lands for ten years.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nReasoning:\r\n\r\nThe policy described in the passage is the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which was signed in 1862. The treaty was signed by the Indians and the United States, and was intended to create a treaty of peace between the Indians and the United States. The treaty was signed in 1862, which is before the date of the passage. The passage describes the policy as aimed at creating a peaceful settlement between the Indians and the white settlers. However, the passage does not mention the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which was signed in 1862. Therefore, the policy described in the passage is not the first Treaty of Fort Laramie.\r\n\r\nThe passage also does not mention the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland, which was a policy of the Indians in the 1800s. Therefore, the policy described in the passage is not the forced removal of the Cherokee from their homeland.\r\n\r\nThe passage also does not mention the negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government, which was a policy of the Indians in the 1800s. Therefore, the policy described in the passage is not the negotiated settlement between the tribes of the Southeast and the U.S. government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (C) the first Treaty of Fort Laramie, which guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River.",

The decision also held that the State should not be allowed to grant citizenship to any Indian tribe that was not a member of the original State's tribal government.

But we do not have the right to resort to violence\u2014or the threat of violence\u2014when we don't get our way. Our founders constructed a system of government so that reason could prevail over fear. Oklahoma City proved once again that without the law there is no freedom.

It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work.
