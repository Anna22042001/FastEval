            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "A) Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\r\n\r\nThis is true because the stare decisis principle is a rule of appellate courts that states that appellate judges should not use their discretionary judgment to decide cases that are beyond their jurisdiction. This principle is meant to protect appellate judges from making unreasonable or irrational decisions that could harm the interests of the appellate court.\r\n\r\nB) Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\r\n\r\nThis is true because appellate courts are often responsible for conducting jury trials, which involve a group of people (usually a jury) trying to prove a case. Jury trials are more rigorous and less likely to be disputed than appellate trials, which are often conducted by a single appellate judge.\r\n\r\nC) Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\r\n\r\nThis is true because appellate judges are often the final arbiter of a case, and they are responsible for making the final decision on the merits of the case. They may also review the decisions of lower courts to ensure that the appellate court's decision is fair and impartial.\r\n\r\nD) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\r\n\r\nThis is true because appellate judges are often responsible for reviewing the decisions of lower courts to ensure that their decision is fair and impartial. They may also consult with other appellate judges to ensure that their decision is in accordance with the law and the best interests of the appellate court.",

The Reorganization Plan established a new White House and a new Senate. The Executive Order authorized the president to select the staff for the Peace Corps, which was established in 1963. However, the president was not authorized to select the staff for the White House or the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations was established in 1939 to oversee the budget and finances of the United States. Therefore, the answer is (C) Senate Committee on Appropriations.",

            "question": "While ratifying the Constitution, the primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was over\n\n(A) whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population\n(B) the strength of the federal government relative to the states\n(C) the future of the slave trade\n(D) whether people had inalienable rights",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nThe primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was over whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population. This is a crucial issue that has a significant impact on the ability of the federal government to provide effective policy guidance and oversee the economic and political development of the nation. \r\n\r\nFederalists argue that representation in Congress should be proportional to population because they believe that the greater the population, the greater the need for representation. This is because the more people in a state, the more likely it is that they will vote for a candidate running for a seat in Congress. This would ensure that the federal government has a stronger voice in shaping the policies of the nation. \r\n\r\nAnti-Federalists argue that representation in Congress should be equal among states because they believe that the federal government should have a stronger voice in shaping policies than the states. This is because the federal government has the power to make laws that affect all states, whereas the states have the power to make laws that only affect them. This would ensure that the federal government has a stronger voice in shaping the policies of the nation. \r\n\r\nThe strength of the federal government relative to the states is also a crucial issue. Federalists argue that the federal government should be stronger than the states because they believe that the federal government has the power to provide better services to the nation. This would ensure that the federal government has a stronger voice in shaping the policies of the nation. Anti-Federalists argue that the federal government should be weaker than the states because they believe that the federal government should not have the power to provide better services to the nation. This would ensure that the federal government has a weaker voice in shaping the policies of the nation. \r\n\r\nThe future of the slave trade is also a crucial issue. Federalists argue that the slave trade should be abolished because they believe that it is harmful to the economy and the environment. This would ensure that the federal government has a stronger voice in shaping the policies of the nation. Anti-Federalists argue that the slave trade should be allowed because they believe that it is essential to the economy and the environment. This would ensure that the federal government has a weaker voice in shaping the policies of the nation. \r\n\r\nFinally, whether people had inalienable rights is a crucial issue. Federalists argue that people should have inalienable rights because they believe that they are entitled to certain privileges and benefits that are essential to their survival. This would ensure that the federal government has a stronger voice in shaping the policies of the nation. Anti-Federalists argue that people should not have inalienable rights because they believe that they should not be held hostage by the government. This would ensure that the federal government has a weaker voice in shaping the policies of the nation. \r\n\r\nBased on the reasoning above, the primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was over whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population. This is a crucial issue that has a significant impact on the ability of the federal government to provide effective policy guidance and oversee the economic and political development of the nation. \r\n\r\nAnswer:C.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nPeople who join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong most often do so because of peer pressure. Peer pressure is a strong influence that can be felt by individuals who are members of a particular political party. It is a strong feeling that comes from the fact that the party has a certain image or reputation, and that the individual is expected to conform to that image. Peer pressure can come from a variety of sources, including family, friends, and even the media.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that peer pressure is not always a bad thing. Peer pressure can be a powerful tool in encouraging people to conform to a party's image. For example, if a politician is known for being a progressive, then his or her supporters may be more likely to support policies that are progressive as well.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why people join a political party other than their parents' is because of economic issues. Many political parties are founded on the backs of wealthy individuals, and those who join these parties are often wealthy themselves. This can create a sense of entitlement, where the individual is expected to conform to the party's image because of their wealth.\r\n\r\nFinally, religious beliefs can also be a reason why people join a political party other than their parents' most often. Many political parties are founded on the backs of religious leaders, and those who join these parties are often religious themselves. This can create a sense of conformity, where the individual is expected to conform to the party's image because of their religious beliefs.\r\n\r\nOverall, the answer is (A) peer pressure.",

If a House member is assigned to multiple committees, they may not be able to focus on their assigned committees and may not be able to contribute meaningfully to the House.\r\n\r\n(B) Senate committees have relatively little power to alter legislation: This is because Senate committees have a much smaller number of members and are generally more focused on ensuring that the Senate is functioning efficiently. If a Senate committee has the power to alter legislation, it could potentially have a significant impact on the outcome of the Senate.\r\n\r\n(C) bills in the Senate must pass through all committees before reaching the floor: This is because bills in the Senate must be approved by all committees before they can be considered for passage.
