            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity: This is a common misconception. Light is not actually slowed by gravity, but rather accelerated by it. The Sun is not a perfect sphere, and the gravitational force exerted on it is not uniform. However, the general trend is that light is slowed by gravity.\r\n\r\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected: This is also a common misconception. Light passing through a sphere is not actually deflected, but rather refracted. The Sun is not a perfect sphere, and the light rays passing through it are not perfectly aligned with the surface. However, the general trend is that light passing through a sphere is deflected.\r\n\r\n(C) A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth: This is a common misconception. The Sun\u2019s rotation is slower than Earth\u2019s due to the fact that the Sun is much smaller than Earth. However, the general trend is that the Sun\u2019s rotation is faster than Earth\u2019s.\r\n\r\n(D) All of these: This is a common misconception.

            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nA galvanometer is a device that measures the electrical potential difference between two electrodes. It is used to measure the current or voltage flowing through a circuit.\r\n\r\nTo calibrate a galvanometer, we need to measure the potential difference between the two electrodes. This can be done by connecting the two electrodes together and measuring the potential difference between them.\r\n\r\nIf we are measuring the current, we need to connect the positive terminal of the galvanometer to the positive terminal of the source, and the negative terminal to the negative terminal of the source. We can then measure the potential difference between the two electrodes and divide it by the applied current to get the measured current.\r\n\r\nIf we are measuring the voltage, we need to connect the positive terminal of the galvanometer to the positive terminal of the source, and the negative terminal to the negative terminal of the source.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nWhen an element ejects a beta particle, it is usually assumed that the atomic number of that element decreases by 1. However, there are other possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. The element may have a different atomic number before and after the beta particle ejection. For example, if the element is a noble gas, its atomic number may increase by 1.\r\n\r\n2. The element may have a different atomic number before and after the beta particle ejection, but the change is not significant enough to affect the element's chemical properties. For example, if the element is a metal, its atomic number may increase by 1, but the change is not significant enough to affect its electrical properties.\r\n\r\n3. The element may have a different atomic number before and after the beta particle ejection, but the change is significant enough to affect the element's chemical properties.

The pressure is measured by the amount of water vapor in the air. The height of the barometer is determined by the height of the instrument and the distance between the instrument and the ground.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is shorter, it means that the instrument is higher up and closer to the ground. This means that the atmospheric pressure is lower, which means that the weather will be colder.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is taller, it means that the instrument is lower down and farther from the ground. This means that the atmospheric pressure is higher, which means that the weather will be warmer.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is equal in height, it means that the instrument is in the same height as the ground. This means that the atmospheric pressure is the same, which means that the weather will be neither colder nor warmer.\r\n\r\nIf the barometer is inoperable, it means that the instrument is not functioning properly.
