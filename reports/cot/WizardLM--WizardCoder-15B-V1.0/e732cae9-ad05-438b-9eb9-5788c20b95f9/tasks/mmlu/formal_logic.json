            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe question asks us to select the best translation into predicate logic. We have four options to choose from, and we need to choose the one that is most appropriate for the given sentence.\r\n\r\nOption A: (\u2203x)(Px \u2022 Sxj)\r\n\r\nThis option is the most natural one, as it uses the existential quantifier to say that there exists a planet that is smaller than Jupiter. The predicate Sxj is used to define the relationship between the planet and Jupiter, and the existential quantifier ensures that there is at least one planet that satisfies this relationship.\r\n\r\nOption B: (\u2200x)(Px \u2022 Sxj)\r\n\r\nThis option is also valid, but it is less natural. It uses the universal quantifier to say that all planets are smaller than Jupiter. However, the predicate Sxj is used to define the relationship between the planet and Jupiter, and the universal quantifier ensures that all planets satisfy this relationship.\r\n\r\nOption C: (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sjx)\r\n\r\nThis option is also valid, but it is less natural. It uses the universal quantifier to say that all planets are smaller than Jupiter. However, the predicate Sjx is used to define the relationship between the planet and Jupiter, and the implication operator \u2283 is used to say that if a planet is smaller than Jupiter, then it is also smaller than all other planets.\r\n\r\nOption D: (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj)\r\n\r\nThis option is the most natural one, as it uses the universal quantifier to say that all planets are smaller than Jupiter. The predicate Sxj is used to define the relationship between the planet and Jupiter, and the implication operator \u2283 is used to say that if a planet is smaller than Jupiter, then it is also smaller than all other planets.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best translation into predicate logic is Option D: (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj).",

Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nT = false, U = true, W = true, X = true\r\nT \u2283 U\r\nT = false, U = true\r\nT \u2283 true\r\n\r\nT = false, U = true, W = true, X = true\r\nW \u2283 U\r\nW = true, U = true\r\nW \u2283 true\r\n\r\nT = false, U = true, W = true, X = true\r\nT \u2283 ~(U \u2283 X)\r\nT = false, U = true, X = true\r\n~(U \u2283 X) = false\r\nT \u2283 false\r\n\r\nTherefore, the set of propositions is consistent and the consistent valuation is when U, W, and X are true and T is false.",
