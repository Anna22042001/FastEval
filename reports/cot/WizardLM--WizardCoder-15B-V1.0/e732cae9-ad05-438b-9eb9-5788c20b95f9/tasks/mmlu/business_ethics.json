The enlightened self-interest of the organization is to put itself first in achieving its goals, rather than to seek to please shareholders or to obey the law.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nPredatory pricing refers to a market practice where firms charge higher prices to attract customers and then lower prices to maintain their position in the market. This practice can lead to a loss of customers and a decrease in profits for the firm.\r\n\r\nThe most common form of predatory pricing is the \"price discrimination\" practice, where firms charge different prices to different customers based on their demographics, income, or other factors. This practice can be effective in certain markets, but it is not always the best option for all markets.\r\n\r\nIn the given scenario, the answer is (A) because the predatory pricing practice involves charging higher prices to attract customers and then lower prices to maintain their position in the market. This means that the firms charge prices that are higher than the average price for the market, but lower than the price that they would have to charge if they were not predatory.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (A) because the predatory pricing practice involves charging higher prices to attract customers and then lower prices to maintain their position in the market.",
