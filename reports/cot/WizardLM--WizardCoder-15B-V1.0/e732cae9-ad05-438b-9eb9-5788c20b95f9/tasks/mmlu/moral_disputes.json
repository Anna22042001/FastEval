            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) and (D). \r\n\r\nHourdequin argues that individualism leads us into tragedy of the commons situations because it instills in us an atomistic view of persons. This view of persons is based on the idea that individuals have moral obligations and that they should be treated as such. However, individualism also leads us into a failure of developing integration and integrality. This is because individualism encourages us to think of ourselves as separate from others, which can lead to conflicts and disagreements. \r\n\r\nHourdequin also argues that individualism can lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods. This is because individualism encourages us to think of ourselves as separate from others, which can lead to pollution and hazards. \r\n\r\nHourdequin also argues that individualism can lead to \"tragedy of the commons\" situations.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nPhilippa Foot is arguing that the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant because it is a fundamental right that protects the right to life and liberty. The distinction is based on the idea that the person who commits murder or suicide is not entitled to any form of compensation, while the person who is merely killed or let go is entitled to compensation. This distinction is essential for the protection of human life and liberty, and it is morally relevant because it is a fundamental right that is not subject to the will of the victim.\r\n\r\nAccording to the moral relevance argument, the answer is (C) both A and B. This is because the killing/letting die distinction is a fundamental right that protects the right to life and liberty, and it is morally relevant because it is essential for the protection of human life and liberty. It is also a right that is not subject to the will of the victim.",
