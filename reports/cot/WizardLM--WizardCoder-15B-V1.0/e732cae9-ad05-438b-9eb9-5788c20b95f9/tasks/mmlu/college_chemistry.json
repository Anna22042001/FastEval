This reaction is the most stable and occurs at room temperature.\r\n\r\nThe second option is less likely to occur because it involves a simple reaction involving Zn and Ag. The Zn(s) reacts with Ag(NO3)(aq) to form Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq), which is a simple reaction that occurs at room temperature.\r\n\r\nThe third option is also less likely to occur because it involves a simple reaction involving Pb and Ca.
