We know that the box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. Therefore, the force applied to the box is proportional to the speed of the box. \r\n\r\nSince the box travels 5 m with the constant force applied, the force applied to the box is 5 N. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 3 N. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe constant force applied to the box is 3 N.
