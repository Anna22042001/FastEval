How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nIf the angular separation between the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of the eyes, then the two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell. This is because the two stars will appear to be very close together, and the angular resolution of the eyes is not able to distinguish between them. \r\n\r\nHowever, if the angular separation is larger than the angular resolution of the eyes, then the two stars will look like a single point of light. This is because the two stars will appear to be far apart, and the angular resolution of the eyes will be able to distinguish between them. \r\n\r\nIf the angular separation is equal to the angular resolution of the eyes, then the two stars will not be visible to the eyes at all. This is because the two stars will appear to be very close together, and the angular resolution of the eyes is not able to distinguish between them. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
