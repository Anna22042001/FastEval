The most important part of the healing process for those who are bereaved is to stay away from other people for a while. This is because the loss can be a very personal and difficult time for the bereaved person, and it is important to let them go and focus on their own healing.\r\n\r\nNext, getting out and being active is also important. This is because the loss can be a very traumatic experience, and it is important to be physically active and mentally alert. This can help to reduce the impact of the loss on the bereaved person's body and mind.\r\n\r\nTalking about your loss is also important. This can help to bring closure to the bereaved person's loss, and it can help to establish a sense of community and connection with those who have been there for them.\r\n\r\nFinally, making new friends who don't know about your loss is also important. This can help to build a sense of community and support for the bereaved person, and it can help to establish a new sense of self-esteem and identity.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(B) Get out and be active.",

However, this generation is now considered to be over.\r\n- The steadily increasing birth rate is a major reason for the increase in numbers of older adults. However, this is not the only reason.\r\n- Increases in life expectancy at birth is the most obvious reason for the increase in numbers of older adults. This is because the longer an individual lives at birth, the more opportunity they have to live longer.\r\n- Increases in life expectancy at a specified age is not a major reason for the increase in numbers of older adults.
