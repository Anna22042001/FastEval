            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) To identify quasi species viruses. \r\n\r\nNGS is used to identify quasi-species viruses because it can detect mutations that are unique to a particular species, but not present in other species. This can be useful for researchers who are interested in studying the evolution of viruses and how they interact with other species. NGS can also be used to identify drug-resistant mutants, but this is not the primary purpose of NGS.",

Placebo effect: Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial helps to reduce the risk of a placebo effect, which occurs when a medication is administered to a patient without any real benefit. Randomization ensures that the placebo group receives the medication and the active group does not.\r\n\r\n2. Recall bias: Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial helps to reduce the risk of recall bias, which occurs when patients remember the medication they were given and do not take it again. Randomization ensures that patients are given new medications each time they are administered.\r\n\r\n3. Non-compliance: Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial helps to reduce the risk of non-compliance, which occurs when patients do not follow the prescribed medication. Randomization ensures that patients are given the same medication each time they are administered.\r\n\r\n4. Effect modification (interaction): Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial helps to reduce the risk of effect modification (interaction), which occurs when a medication interacts with other medications or conditions and produces unexpected or unwanted effects. Randomization ensures that patients are given medications that do not interact with each other.\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\n\r\n(C) Non-compliance.",

The researcher or group of researchers collects data on the effects of the treatment on the patient and evaluates the results to determine whether the treatment is effective. In a clinical trial, the treatment is usually a drug or a medication.\r\n\r\nDouble-blind: In a double-blind study, the researcher or group of researchers does not know the identity of the participants or the treatment being tested. This is done to protect the participants' anonymity and to prevent any biases or prejudices from influencing the results. The researcher or group of researchers also does not know the outcome of the study until the end of the study.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal: A longitudinal study is a type of research design in which the participants are followed over time to observe changes in their health and behavior. The researcher or group of researchers collects data on the participants' health and behavior over time and evaluates the results to determine whether the treatment is effective. In a longitudinal study, the treatment is usually a treatment that is being administered over time, such as a medication or a therapy.\r\n\r\nProspective cohort: A prospective cohort study is a type of research design in which the participants are divided into two or more groups based on a characteristic, such as age or gender.
