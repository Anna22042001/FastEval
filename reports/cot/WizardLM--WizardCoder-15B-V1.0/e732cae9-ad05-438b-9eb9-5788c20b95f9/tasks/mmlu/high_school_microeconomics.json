            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nThe competitive market provides the best outcome for society because it creates a balance between the needs of consumers and the needs of producers. This balance ensures that consumers are satisfied with the products and services provided by the producers, while producers are able to make a profit.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this balance, the market must be fair and efficient. Fairness ensures that all participants in the market are treated fairly, and efficiency ensures that the market is efficient and does not waste resources.\r\n\r\nTo ensure fairness, the market must be transparent and clear. Transparency ensures that all information about the market is available to all participants, and clearness ensures that all rules and regulations are followed.\r\n\r\nTo ensure efficiency, the market must be efficient in both supply and demand. Efficiency in supply means that the producers are able to provide the consumers with the necessary products and services, while efficiency in demand means that the consumers are able to obtain the products and services they need.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this balance, the market must be competitive. Competition ensures that there is only one winner in the market, and that the winner is the one that provides the best products and services. Competition also promotes innovation and creativity, as the winner is able to provide a better product or service than the competition.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is fair, the market must be free of bias. Bias is the prejudice that some people have against others, and it can affect the market negatively. To ensure fairness, the market must be free of bias, and all participants must be treated equally.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is efficient, the market must be scalable. Scalability means that the market can be expanded or contracted as needed, and that the resources used by the producers and consumers are proportional to the demand and supply of the market.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is transparent and clear, the market must be regulated. Regulation ensures that all rules and regulations are followed, and that the market is fair and efficient.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is competitive, the market must be organized. Organized means that the market is structured and controlled, and that all participants are involved in the decision-making process.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is free of bias, the market must be diverse. Diversity means that the market is made up of different types of participants, and that all participants are treated equally.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is scalable, the market must be global. Global means that the market is accessible to all participants, and that the resources used by the producers and consumers are distributed globally.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is regulated, the market must be enforceable. Enforcement means that all rules and regulations are enforced, and that the market is fair and efficient.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is organized, the market must be transparent. Transparency ensures that all information about the market is available to all participants, and that all participants are involved in the decision-making process.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the market is diverse, the market must be inclusive.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe county government is sending each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare. This is a direct subsidy to the child's education and care. The government is not directly providing daycare services, but rather subsidizing the cost of sending each child to a daycare center.\r\n\r\nThis means that the supply of daycare services is rising, which means that the cost of providing daycare services is falling. This is because the demand for daycare services is rising, which means that more parents are choosing to send their children to daycare.
