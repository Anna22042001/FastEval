            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning:\r\n\r\nSelf-sufficiency refers to the ability of a nation or an industry to operate without relying on external supplies or resources. In other words, it is the ability of a nation or an industry to produce its own resources and maintain itself without relying on foreign aid or subsidies.\r\n\r\nIn the context of modern industry, the natural resources needed for modern industry are mostly fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. These fossil fuels are essential for the production of a wide range of goods and services, including agriculture, industry, transportation, and energy.\r\n\r\nHowever, modern industry also requires a significant amount of non-renewable resources such as water, electricity, and land. These non-renewable resources are not fossil fuels and cannot be produced by humans alone. Therefore, the least self-sufficient natural resources for modern industry are those that are not renewable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (D) United Kingdom, as it is the only country that is not self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Contagious diffusion is a process where information is spread through social media, websites, and other online platforms. It is a process that is widely used in the industry and is responsible for the spread of new fashion designs. The information is initially shared through social media platforms and then propagated through other platforms. This process is known to be effective in spreading fashion designs and has led to a significant increase in the popularity of the designs. However, it is important to note that this process can be harmful if not used properly.\r\n\r\nRelocation diffusion is a process where designs are moved from one location to another. This process is used by companies that want to create a brand identity that is unique and recognizable. The designs are moved from one location to another and then sold on the market. This process is known to be effective in creating a brand identity and has led to a significant increase in the popularity of the designs. However, it is important to note that this process can be expensive and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nInnovative diffusion is a process where designers create new designs that are not already on the market. This process is used by companies that want to create a new design that is different from what is already available. The designs are created and then sold on the market. This process is known to be effective in creating new designs and has led to a significant increase in the popularity of the designs. However, it is important to note that this process can be expensive and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nHierarchical diffusion is a process where designers create designs that are based on the styles and ideas of other designers. This process is used by companies that want to create a design that is unique and original. The designs are created based on the styles and ideas of other designers and then sold on the market. This process is known to be effective in creating unique designs and has led to a significant increase in the popularity of the designs. However, it is important to note that this process can be expensive and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nThe answer is (C) innovative diffusion.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) agglomeration. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe concentration of production activities and people spatially to benefit everyone is a key concept in economics. It is a principle that states that the production of goods and services should be done in a way that benefits all the consumers. The principle is based on the idea that consumers should be provided with the same goods and services regardless of their location. \r\n\r\nThe substitution principle is a specific type of agglomeration that focuses on the production of goods and services in a way that minimizes the use of resources and maximizes the use of consumers. It is based on the idea that consumers should be provided with goods and services that are similar to what they are used to, but at a lower price. \r\n\r\nThe term \"deglomeration\" refers to the process of separating different sectors of a market into smaller, more specialized markets. The term \"agglomeration\" refers to the process of combining different markets into larger, more general markets.
