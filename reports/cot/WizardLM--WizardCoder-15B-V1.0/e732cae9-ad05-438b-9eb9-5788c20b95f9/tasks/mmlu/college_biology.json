            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Explanation:\r\n\r\nA) The Golgi apparatus is located in the cytoplasm of the cell. It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Golgi apparatus is responsible for transporting small molecules and organelles from the ER to the nucleus. The Golgi apparatus is also responsible for the transport of a wide range of macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\r\n\r\nB) The Golgi apparatus is associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. These vesicles are responsible for transporting small molecules and organelles from the ER to the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus also processes these small molecules and organelles, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, to produce larger macromolecules that are transported to the ER.\r\n\r\nC) The composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are continuous with one another. This means that the cisternae are arranged in a line, with each cisternae being connected to the next one by a thin layer of fibrin. This arrangement helps to minimize the amount of water that needs to be transported between the Golgi apparatus and the ER.\r\n\r\nD) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen. This occurs in the Golgi apparatus, where the protein is first processed to remove any pre-existing glycosylation sites. The resulting protein is then transported to the ER where it is processed further to add glycosylation sites. This process is necessary to ensure that the protein is properly packaged for transport to the nucleus.",
