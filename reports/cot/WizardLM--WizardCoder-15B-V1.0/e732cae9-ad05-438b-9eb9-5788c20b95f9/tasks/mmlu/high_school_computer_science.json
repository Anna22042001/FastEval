The programming language is a way of writing these instructions in a human-readable format. The program can be expressed in a programming language in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. As source code: This is the original way of writing programs. The source code is a set of instructions written in a programming language that can be read and understood by a human.\r\n\r\n2. As binary code: This is a compiled version of the program. The binary code is a set of instructions that can be executed by the computer. The binary code is usually more efficient than the source code, but it cannot be read by a human.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question is (A). The program can also be expressed as binary code, but will be more easily understood by humans when expressed in a higher-level programming language. This is because the higher-level programming language provides a more abstract and human-readable way of expressing the program. The binary code can be used to execute the program, but it is not as human-readable as the source code.",
