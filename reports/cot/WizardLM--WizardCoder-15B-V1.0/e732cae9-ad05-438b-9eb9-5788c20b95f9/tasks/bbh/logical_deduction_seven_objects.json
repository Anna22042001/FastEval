We know that there are seven fruits being sold, so we can start by listing them out:\r\n\r\n- Mangoes\r\n- Kiwis\r\n- Oranges\r\n- Watermelons\r\n- Apples\r\n- Pears\r\n- Loquats\r\n\r\nNext, we need to determine the price of each fruit. We can assume that the prices are listed in descending order, with the most expensive fruit being listed first. We can also assume that the loquats are less expensive than the oranges, and that the oranges are the third-most expensive.\r\n\r\n- Mangoes: $2.50\r\n- Kiwis: $1.75\r\n- Oranges: $1.50\r\n- Watermelons: $1.25\r\n- Apples: $0.75\r\n- Pears: $1.00\r\n- Loquats: $0.80\r\n\r\nNow that we have the prices of each fruit, we can compare them to determine which fruit is the third-most expensive. We can start by comparing the prices of the mangoes and watermelons. The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons, so we know that the mangoes are the third-most expensive.\r\n\r\n- Mangoes: $2.50\r\n- Kiwis: $1.75\r\n- Oranges: $1.50\r\n- Watermelons: $1.25\r\n- Apples: $0.75\r\n- Pears: $1.00\r\n- Loquats: $0.80\r\n\r\nNext, we can compare the prices of the kiwis and pears. The kiwis are more expensive than the pears, so we know that the kiwis are the third-most expensive.\r\n\r\n- Mangoes: $2.50\r\n- Kiwis: $1.75\r\n- Oranges: $1.50\r\n- Watermelons: $1.25\r\n- Apples: $0.75\r\n- Pears: $1.00\r\n- Loquats: $0.80\r\n\r\nFinally, we can compare the prices of the oranges, apples, and loquats. The oranges are the third-most expensive, so we know that the oranges are the third-most expensive.\r\n\r\n- Mangoes: $2.50\r\n- Kiwis: $1.75\r\n- Oranges: $1.50\r\n- Watermelons: $1.25\r\n- Apples: $0.75\r\n- Pears: $1.00\r\n- Loquats: $0.80\r\n\r\nTherefore, the answer is (E) The apples are the third-most expensive.",

The order is important because it represents the order in which the golfers finished in the tournament. The first golfer to finish is Joe, the second is Dan, and so on. The last golfer to finish is Mel.\r\n\r\nThe golfers who finished above Amy are Ada and Eve. Ada finished below Ana, which means that Ada was the second-to-last golfer to finish. Eve finished above Amy, which means that Eve was the first golfer to finish.\r\n\r\nThe golfers who finished second are Dan and Ada. Ada finished below Ana, which means that Ada was the second-to-last golfer to finish. Dan finished second, which means that Dan was the second golfer to finish.\r\n\r\nThe golfers who finished third-to-last are Ana and Ada. Ada finished below Ana, which means that Ada was the second-to-last golfer to finish.
