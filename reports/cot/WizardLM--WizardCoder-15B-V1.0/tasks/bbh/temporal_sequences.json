            "model_answer": "Our reasoning: \r\n\r\nJessica went to the basketball court at some point between 2pm and 2pm, inclusive. \r\n\r\n(1) Jessica woke up at 5am, so the first time she could have gone to the basketball court was between 5am and 6am. So, option (B) is not valid. But, based on the events that happened between 5am and 6am, we know that she could have went to the basketball court. \r\n\r\n(2) After 6am, Michael saw Jessica buying clothes at the mall. \r\n\r\n(3) Michael left the mall at 6am, so she would have already been in the basketball court. Therefore, only the times between 7am and 2pm after Michael's absence could have been when Jessica could have gone to the basketball court. \r\n\r\n(4) There were no other events that could have affected the times Jessica could have gone to the basketball court. \r\n\r\nOverall, Jessica could have gone to the basketball court between 7am and 6pm. Hence, option (C) is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "We can start by assuming that Ashley did not leave the house or the bookstore until 5am so their first possible time to go is 5am. \r\n\r\nShe could have gone to the bookstore from 5am to 11am, so her second possible time is 11am. \r\n\r\nShe could also have gone from 11am to 1pm, but then Jason, Emily, and Kimberly may have been sleeping or at work. If any of them were not at work before 11am, Ashley would have seen them go to work before they left for lunch. \r\n\r\nSo if all three of them were at work before 11am, she would have been able to go to the bookstore only after 1pm. \r\n\r\nThe next possible time for Ashley to go to the bookstore would be 1pm to 3pm, but then Emily, Kimberly, and Jason might all be working or at work. \r\n\r\nIf they were all at work before 1pm, Ashley would have seen Kimberly go to work, then after Kimberly was finished, see Jason go to work, and then only after that was finished would Emily be back home for the day. \r\n\r\nSo if all three of them were at work before 1pm, she would have been able to go to the bookstore only after 3pm. \r\n\r\nKimberly's last shift ends at 6pm, so she would have to go to work by 6pm to catch the last bus to the bookstore before it closed. \r\n\r\nThe final possible time for Ashley to go to the bookstore is 3pm to 6pm, which ends before the bookstore closes. \r\n\r\nSo our reasoning is that Ashley could have gone from 5am to 6pm",
