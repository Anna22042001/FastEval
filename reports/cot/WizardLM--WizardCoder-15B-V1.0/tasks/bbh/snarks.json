            "model_answer": "The first statement is sarcastic. This is because it is not condescending and instead encourages the reader to be happy instead of pointing out the depression of others. The reason for this is because sarcasm often creates a funny, humorous or ironic twist on a person's message and the tone used in the statement creates a sense of humor that adds to the message. The second statement is more condescending as it uses the word \"just\" without any empathy towards the reader. This is another way of making the message seem as a joke or an attempt to be funny.",

However, I have some questions:\r\n\r\n- Does it insult or humiliate racists?\r\n- Are you being positive and joke when you say \"keeps it okay\"?\r\n- Does it connote a positive or lighter tone?\r\n- How would you feel if you were a racist yourself?\r\n\r\nIf none of the above answers are true (or if you cannot answer all of them), then it's likely that the statement is not sarcastic.\r\n\r\nAs for the second option, \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic\", it is not sarcastic.

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "Reasoning: Statement A is definitely sarcastic because it uses a different tone of voice than the other two options. It starts with \"He didn't threaten,\" indicating a slight humorous tone. \"He only urged\" further adds humor by adding emphasis to the statement without using an exaggeration or insulting the listener. It's a direct, literal translation of \"he only insisted on doing things\" or \"he only asked for a favor\". These are both overly literal and don't seem sarcastic at all, making it a genuine irony.\r\n\r\nStatement B is sarcastic as well because it uses the negative tone and includes the term \"threating,\" even though it is not intended to offend or make someone feel threatened. It also includes the word \"pleaded\" instead of \"urged,\" which further indicates a slightly different tone and doesn't entirely avoid the connotation of threats or threats of violence. \"He only pleaded\" is the exact same tone and words as Statement A, making it a genuine irony.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) He didn't threaten, he only pleaded; sarcastic.",

However, the statement is not a truthful statement, as it only reduces the reader's problem, but not solves it. Therefore, it does not constitute a valid sarcastic statement. \n\nStatement (B) may be sarcastic, but it is hard to say without additional context. The statement uses \"not\" before \"being rude\" to dismiss the personality traits in question, which suggests that the person might be making a joke.

In the first statement, the author is using the phrase \"get rid of the trams\" to convey a chilling message. However, \"let's build carriages instead\" may also convey the same tone, but without any humor. Thus, the first statement is more sarcastic.\r\n\r\nThe second statement is less sarcastic because it is a more direct and clear message.

However, it's important to note that the statement does not specifically state that the person is taking a new lifestyle after not exercising for a while, which might make it more difficult to identify as sarcastic.\r\n\r\nI would assume that statement B is the sarcastic one, as it is more focused on the person's exercise habit and not on the lifestyle transformation itself.

The statement \"Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef\" seems more truthful, making it a more accurate statement. The reasoning behind this is that McDonald's has always been known for great food and great service and has provided many positive benefits to people's lives for centuries. Therefore, the statement that McDonald's was responsible for making you an amazing chef could potentially upset some people who might have never even heard of McDonald's before. On the other hand, working at a restaurant could potentially make you an amazing chef, as it requires you to interact with people, experience new cultures, and have fun with your colleagues.
