However, 'thetdark' is related to 'the dark' and could be intended as 'the dark'. \n\n(C) 'the dork' adds a joke element but leaves out the main title 'the dark knight'.\n\n(D) 'the kniggt' is a typo where 'n' is misplaced, and 't' is missing, so it could be interpreted as 'then'. \n\nBased on the reasoning above, I would choose option (B).
