Hence, the translation of \"kann das\" would be \"did\" instead of \"can do\". \n- In this error, the adjective \"k\u00fchn\" is misplaced. \"K\u00fchn\" is the suffix indicating high temperature in German. However, it does not belong to a noun. Therefore, it should be moved outside the noun phrase.\n- The adjective \"jaund\" is correctly translated as \"beautiful\".\n- The phrase \"F\u00fcrsklingel\" means \"drunkard.\" However, it is rare in English and is often misused. Hence, it should be replaced with \"drunken.\"\n- In the translation, \"wird man\" is incorrectly translated as \"williams.\" \"Williams\" is a surname. The correct English term for her is Mary.\n- The translation is missing a comma after \"aus der Krise.\"\n- The translation contains a grammatical error. \"Charles\" is supposed to be a masculine pronoun, but it is being used as a neuter. To correct this, we use \"his\" instead of \"his\".",

In German, cardinal values are the base form of numbers, i.e., no prefix, and they represent numbers in an ordered sequence. However, the numerical value \"70\" in the English translation is replaced with a noun phrase, which makes it ambiguous and unclear as to its actual meaning. Similarly, the numerical values \"500\" and \"750\" in the translation indicate a date in years, and these values are replaced with the expression \"in the year 1990\". Additionally, the unit of measurement \"nm\" has been changed to \"mm\" without any additional context or explanation.
