Christmas Eve falls on the 24th of December, while the first day of the year is the 1st of January. Therefore, if we subtract 24 from the number of days in December, we get the number of days left in the year before December 25th. We can then add that to the original date to get to the date of the day after Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\nSince Christmas Eve is on December 24th 1937, we can see that there are 46 days between December 24th and January 1st, for a total of 1937 days in the year. If we subtract 24, we get 1913. We add this to January 1st and get January 25th. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the date of Christmas Eve is 12/24/1937, and the date of the day after Christmas Eve is January 25th, which is represented by the letter B.",

The correct date is May 6th, 1992 which has the format MM/DD/YYYY. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 05/06/2002.\nExplanation: To get to yesterday, we subtract one day from today. This means we subtract 1 from the current date which is 1992-05-06 = 1991-05-05 = 1991-05-05 = 1991-05-05. Therefore, in the given date, we subtract 1 from the day, which gives us May 6th, 1992.",
