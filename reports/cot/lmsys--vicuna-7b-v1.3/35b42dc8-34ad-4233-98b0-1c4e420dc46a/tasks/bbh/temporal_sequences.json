If Susan was working at the office from 4pm to 5pm, she couldn't have gone to the museum before 4pm or after 5pm.\n3.

Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Mary woke up at 9am.\n2. David saw Mary walking in the garden from 9am to 11am. Since Mary was walking in the garden during this time, she couldn't have gone to the restaurant.\n3. Samantha saw Mary getting a coffee at the cafe from 2pm to 3pm. Since Mary was getting a coffee during this time, she couldn't have gone to the restaurant.\n4. Sarah saw Mary driving to the water park from 3pm to 7pm. Since Mary was driving during this time, she couldn't have gone to the restaurant.\n5. The restaurant was closed after 7pm.\n\nNow, we need to find the time range when Mary could have gone to the restaurant. Since Mary wasn't at the restaurant at any of the times mentioned (9am, 11am, 2pm, or 3pm), the only possible time range is between 11am and 7pm.\n\nThe answer is (D) 11am to 2pm.",
