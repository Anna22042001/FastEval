The blue book is the rightmost.\n\nFrom this information, we can determine the positions of the books in the shelf:\n\n* The gray book is to the left of the red book.\n* The yellow book is to the left of the gray book.\n* The orange book is to the left of the red book.\n* The blue book is to the left of the orange book.\n\nNow, we can use this information to determine the position of each book:\n\n* The gray book is to the left of the red book, so it must be the first book from the left.\n* The yellow book is to the left of the gray book, so it must be the second book from the left.\n* The orange book is to the left of the red book, so it must be the third book from the left.\n* The blue book is to the left of the orange book, so it must be the fourth book from the left.\n* The red book is to the right of the gray book, so it must be the fifth book from the left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The blue book is the third from the left.",
