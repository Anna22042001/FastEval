            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of the purchase of the Matisse painting on GDP, we need to consider the different ways in which the purchase affects the economy.\n\n(A) GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.\n\nThis is because the purchase of the Matisse painting involves a decrease in consumption, as the corporation spends money on the painting rather than on other goods and services. This decrease in consumption reduces the overall level of economic activity, which in turn reduces GDP.\n\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.\n\nThis is because the purchase of the Matisse painting involves an increase in investment, as the corporation spends money on the painting rather than on other investments. This increase in investment can lead to an increase in economic activity and output, which in turn increases GDP.\n\n(C) GDP is unaffected because it is a second-hand sale.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. While the painting may have been previously owned by someone else, the purchase of the painting by XYZ Corporation still involves a transfer of resources from the corporation to the seller, which can have an impact on the overall level of economic activity.\n\n(D) GDP decreases because I decreases.\n\nThis is also not necessarily true. While the purchase of the Matisse painting may involve a decrease in investment, it is not necessarily the case that investment decreases overall. The purchase may also involve an increase in consumption, which can offset the decrease in investment and lead to no overall effect on GDP.",

            "model_answer": "To determine whether a government has a budget surplus or deficit, we need to compare its total revenue (including taxes) with its total expenditures (including transfer payments and interest on debt).\n\nIf the government collects more money in net taxes than it spends, then it has a budget surplus.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be (D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA supply shock is a change in the price of goods and services that affects the supply of those goods and services. Negative supply shocks occur when the price of inputs used in production increases, making it more expensive for firms to produce goods and services. This can lead to a decrease in production, which in turn can lead to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a decrease in government spending would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity. While it may have an impact on certain sectors of the economy, it is not a supply shock.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because a decrease in the real interest rate would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity. While it may have an impact on certain sectors of the economy, it is not a supply shock.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because an increase in the money supply would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity. While it may have an impact on certain sectors of the economy, it is not a supply shock.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer. Unexpectedly higher resource prices would lead to an increase in the cost of production for firms, making it more expensive for them to produce goods and services. This could lead to a decrease in production, which in turn could lead to a decrease in the overall level of economic activity.",

This outcome can be explained by a variety of factors, including changes in technology, changes in the nation's production capacity, changes in the nation's trade policies, or changes in the nation's economic conditions.\n\nOption (A) is not a possible explanation because a permanent decrease in production capacity would result in the nation being unable to produce anything at all, not just being unable to produce at the production possibility curve.\n\nOption (B) is not a possible explanation because slower than usual technological progress would result in the nation being able to produce more goods and services, not less.\n\nOption (C) is not a possible explanation because avoiding free trade between other nations would result in the nation being unable to trade with other nations, not being able to produce at the production possibility curve.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer because an economic recession is a period of economic decline, typically defined as a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) for two consecutive quarters. During a recession, a nation's production capacity may be affected, which could result in the nation being unable to produce at the production possibility curve.",

The options given are (A) a thing of the past, (B) very severe depressions, (C) a sustained decline in output, and (D) regular occurrences in capitalist economies.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to understand the definition of a recession. A recession is a period of economic decline, typically defined as a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) for two consecutive quarters.\n\nExamining the options, we can eliminate (A) and (D) as they do not accurately describe a recession. A recession is not necessarily a thing of the past, and it can occur regularly in capitalist economies.\n\nWe can also eliminate (B) as it suggests that recessions are very severe depressions, which is not necessarily true. While recessions can be severe, they are not necessarily depressions in the sense of a complete economic collapse.\n\nThis leaves us with (C) as the correct answer. A recession is marked by a sustained decline in output, which is consistent with a decline in GDP for two consecutive quarters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

Both tariffs and quotas can result in higher domestic prices.\n\nWhen a country imposes a tariff on imported goods, the cost of those goods increases, which raises the price of those goods in the domestic market. This is because the cost of production for the imported goods has increased due to the tariff, and the seller must pass on that increased cost to the buyer.\n\nSimilarly, when a country imposes a quota on a particular good, the quantity of that good available in the domestic market is limited. This can lead to a shortage of the good, which can also result in higher prices.\n\nTherefore, both tariffs and quotas can result in higher domestic prices.",
