            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to first calculate the molar ratio of the elements in the compound. We know that the total mass of the compound is 29.05 g, and we have already determined the masses of carbon and hydrogen. Therefore, we can calculate the mass of oxygen by subtracting the mass of carbon and hydrogen from the total mass:\n\n29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g = 7.02 g\n\nThe molar ratio of carbon to oxygen is 1:3, and the molar ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2. Therefore, we can write the empirical formula as:\n\n(CxHyOz)\n\nwhere x, y, and z are integers.\n\nWe can use the molar ratio of carbon to oxygen to solve for the value of x:\n\nx = 18.02 g / 3 g/mol = 6 mol\n\nWe can then use the molar ratio of hydrogen to oxygen to solve for the values of y and z:\n\ny = 3 g / 2 g/mol = 3/2 mol\nz = 7.02 g / 6 g/mol = 1.17 mol\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula of the compound is:\n\n(C6H10O6)\n\nSo the answer is (D) C3H8O2.",

We can do this by using the molecular weight of propane, which is 3 x 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol.\n\nSince there are 6.2 grams of propane, we can calculate the number of moles of propane by dividing the mass by the molecular weight:\n\n6.2 g / 36.03 g/mol = 0.175 mol\n\nTherefore, there are 0.175 moles of propane in 6.2 grams of propane.\n\nNow we need to compare this value to the given options.\n\n(A) 14.1 mol: This is not a valid answer choice.\n\n(B) 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol: This is not a valid answer choice.\n\n(C) 71 mol: This is not a valid answer choice.\n\n(D) 7.1 mol: This is not a valid answer choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 7.1 mol.",

This is because the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, and the concentrations of the reactants and products remain constant over time. In a spontaneous reaction, the forward reaction will be favored, meaning there will be more products than reactants at equilibrium.\n\n(B) The value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero. \u0394G\u00b0 is the standard Gibbs free energy change at equilibrium, which represents the energy available to do work. A positive value of \u0394G\u00b0 indicates that the reaction is spontaneous, as it has a positive energy change that can be used to do work.\n\n(C) The value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero. \u0394S\u00b0 is the standard entropy change at equilibrium, which represents the disorder or randomness in the system. A positive value of \u0394S\u00b0 indicates that the reaction is spontaneous, as it has a positive entropy change that favors disorder.\n\n(D) The value of Keq is less than one. Keq is the equilibrium constant, which represents the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium. A value of Keq less than one indicates that the reaction shifts in the forward direction, meaning the reaction is spontaneous.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (B).",

This means that the rate of the reaction depends on the concentration of the reactant.\n\nOption (A) asks about increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2. If we increase the initial concentration of the reactant, the rate of the reaction will increase. This will cause the half-life of SO2Cl2 to decrease.\n\nOption (B) asks about increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs. If we increase the temperature, the rate of the reaction will increase. This will cause the half-life of SO2Cl2 to decrease.\n\nOption (C) asks about decreasing the overall pressure in the container. If we decrease the pressure, the rate of the reaction will decrease.
