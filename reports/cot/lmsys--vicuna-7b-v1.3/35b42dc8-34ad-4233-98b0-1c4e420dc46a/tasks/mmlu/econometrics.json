            "model_answer": "To determine the plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality, we need to first understand what residual non-normality means in the context of a regression model.\n\nResidual non-normality occurs when the residuals (the difference between the observed values and the predicted values) in a regression model are not normally distributed. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as heteroscedasticity (when the variance of the residuals changes across different levels of the independent variable), autocorrelation (when the residuals are correlated with previous observations), or other forms of model misspecification.\n\nThere are several potential strategies that can be used to address residual non-normality. One option is to use a different functional form, such as a logarithmic form, which can sometimes be more robust to non-normality. Another option is to add lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model, which can help to capture the autocorrelation in the residuals. A third option is to estimate the model in first-differenced form, which can help to address heteroscedasticity. Finally, removing any large outliers from the data can also help to improve the normality of the residuals.\n\nBased on these considerations, the plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality would be to estimate the model in first-differenced form. This is because first-differencing can help to address heteroscedasticity, which is a common cause of residual non-normality. Therefore, the answer is (C).",
