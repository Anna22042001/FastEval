            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B).\n\nMycorrhizal fungi form a mutualistic association with many plant species, in which the fungus extends its hyphae into the soil to access nutrients, while the plant provides carbohydrates to the fungus. One of the key benefits that mycorrhizal fungi confer to plants is the ability to fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.\n\nNitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is converted into a form that can be used by plants. Mycorrhizal fungi are able to fix nitrogen by converting nitrogen gas into ammonium, which is then taken up by the plant. This process can increase the availability of nitrogen to the plant, allowing it to grow more vigorously and produce more biomass.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because mycorrhizal fungi do not protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats. In fact, the fungal hyphae can actually contribute to water stress by competing with the plant for water.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because mycorrhizal fungi do not provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils. Phosphorus is a macronutrient that is required in relatively small quantities by most plants, and is often present in soils in relatively high concentrations.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because mycorrhizal fungi do not provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen. The fungus obtains carbohydrates from the plant in exchange for providing nutrients to the plant, but it does not fix nitrogen.",

It is composed of stacks of flattened cisternae that are continuous with one another. The cis face of the Golgi apparatus is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while the trans face is in contact with the cell's exterior.\n\nStatement (A) is incorrect because the Golgi apparatus is not oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the ER. Instead, its cis face is closest to the ER, and its trans face faces the cell exterior.\n\nStatement (B) is also incorrect because the Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. In fact, the Golgi apparatus is involved in the modification and packaging of secretory proteins, which are then transported to the cell's exterior by transport vesicles.\n\nStatement (C) is incorrect because the Golgi apparatus's cisternae are not continuous with one another. Instead, they are stacked on top of each other, forming a flattened structure.\n\nStatement (D) is correct because glycosylation of certain secretory proteins can occur in the Golgi apparatus before the protein enters its lumen. Glycosylation is the addition of sugar molecules to proteins, which is an important step in protein folding and stability.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (D).",

            "model_answer": "(D) reversibly decreasing the number of enzyme molecules that are available to bind substrates.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA competitive inhibitor is a molecule that binds to the enzyme's active site and competes with the substrate for binding. However, unlike substrates, inhibitors do not undergo catalysis and are not consumed during the reaction. Instead, they bind to the enzyme and prevent the substrate from binding.\n\nThere are two types of competitive inhibitors: reversible and irreversible. Reversible inhibitors bind and dissociate from the enzyme, allowing the enzyme to regain its full activity once the inhibitor is removed. Irreversible inhibitors, on the other hand, form covalent bonds with the enzyme, effectively preventing it from functioning.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because irreversible inhibitors do not form covalent links with the enzyme. Instead, they bind to the enzyme and prevent it from undergoing catalysis.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because competitive inhibitors do not modify the amino acid residues that help to comprise the enzyme's active site.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which option (A), (B), (C), or (D) is the correct answer, we need to understand how antibiotics affect bacterial cells. Antibiotics work by targeting specific processes in bacterial cells that are essential for their survival.\n\nOption (A) states that antibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a major component of the bacterial cell wall, which provides structural support and protection to the cell. Antibiotics that target peptidoglycan synthesis, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, prevent the formation of the cell wall, leading to bacterial lysis and death.\n\nOption (B) states that antibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is essential for bacterial growth and survival, as proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including replication, transcription, and translation. Antibiotics that target protein synthesis, such as tetracyclines and macrolides, inhibit the activity of the ribosome, preventing the translation of messenger RNA into proteins.\n\nOption (C) states that antibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis is essential for bacterial growth and replication, as it provides the genetic information necessary for the production of new bacterial cells. Antibiotics that target DNA synthesis, such as rifamycins and quinolones, inhibit DNA replication by binding to the DNA molecule or inhibiting DNA polymerase activity.\n\nOption (D) states that antibiotics that affect bacterial cells interfere with reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that is essential for the replication of certain RNA viruses, such as HIV. Antibiotics that target reverse transcriptase, such as reverse transcriptase inhibitors, prevent the synthesis of DNA from RNA, inhibiting the replication of the virus.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D). Antibiotics that affect bacterial cells do not interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis, protein synthesis, or DNA synthesis. They do interfere with reverse transcriptase, which is essential for the replication of certain RNA viruses.",

ZP3 is a glycoprotein found on the surface of the zona pellucida that binds to ZP3 receptors on the surface of sperm.\n\nExperimental observation (A) is expected because antibodies that bind to ZP3 would block the binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3, which would prevent the initiation of the acrosomal reaction in sperm.\n\nExperimental observation (B) is expected because purified ZP3 would bind to ZP3 receptors on sperm, which would prevent the initiation of the acrosomal reaction in sperm.\n\nExperimental observation (C) is expected because antibodies that bind to ZP3 would block the binding of ZP3 receptors to ZP3, which would prevent the initiation of the acrosomal reaction in sperm.\n\nExperimental observation (D) is unexpected because ZP2 is a different glycoprotein that is found on the surface of the zona pellucida.

This process is known as transposition.\n\nPrions are misfolded proteins that can cause a group of atoms to adopt a specific three-dimensional shape, leading to the formation of an abnormal protein structure.\n\nCistrons are circular DNA molecules that can replicate themselves and move around within the genome.
