            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) is the correct answer.\n\nIndividualism, as described by Hourdequin, can lead to two problems:\n\n1. We tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so we may only advocate for policies in \"tragedy of the commons\" situations.\n2. We may also fail to develop integration and integrality, leading to a lack of cooperation and coordination in society.\n\nThese two problems are related to the idea that individualism can lead to a focus on personal interests and a lack of concern for the common good. This can result in a lack of cooperation and coordination, as well as a failure to consider the broader implications of our actions.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question asks us to identify the explanation provided by Philippa Foot for the moral relevance of the distinction between killing and letting die. Philippa Foot is a philosopher known for her work on ethics and moral theory, particularly in the area of moral principles and moral reasoning.\n\n(A) Rights of noninterference: This option does not seem to be directly related to the distinction between killing and letting die. While noninterference is a principle in some moral theories, it does not directly address the moral difference between actively causing harm and allowing harm to occur.\n\n(B) Rights to goods and services: This option is more relevant, as it relates to the idea that people have a right to access certain goods and services that are necessary for their well-being. However, it is not clear how this relates to the distinction between killing and letting die.\n\n(C) Both A and B: This option seems to be the most plausible, as both rights of noninterference and rights to goods and services could potentially be relevant to the moral relevance of the distinction between killing and letting die.\n\n(D) Neither A nor B: This option is less plausible, as both A and B seem to be relevant to Foot's explanation.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is (C) both A and B.",

He argues that our ability to help others is a moral duty, and that we should not let our personal circumstances or beliefs prevent us from acting on this duty.\n\nThe drowning child analogy is used to illustrate the moral imperative of helping others in need. Singer argues that if we witness a child drowning in a nearby pond, we would have a moral obligation to save the child, even if we were not able to do so ourselves.

This is in contrast to moral engineering, which seeks to use scientific or technical means to achieve a particular moral end.\n\nSandel's approach can be seen as an application of the ethics of prima facie duty, which holds that there are certain moral duties that are binding regardless of any other considerations. This is in contrast to other ethical theories, such as consequentialism or virtue ethics, which hold that moral duties are determined by the consequences of actions or the character traits of individuals.\n\nTherefore, Sandel's case against moral engineering can best be considered an application of the ethics of prima facie duty.",

            "model_answer": "(A) absolutely wrong.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMarquis' theory of moral rights and wrongs is based on the idea that there are certain fundamental rights that all human beings have, such as the right to life. According to this theory, abortion is a violation of the right to life, and therefore it is absolutely wrong.\n\n(B) seriously presumptively wrong.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMarquis' theory also holds that there are certain moral principles that are presumptively right, meaning that they are morally obligatory unless there is a strong reason to the contrary. Abortion is a violation of one of these presumptively right principles, which is the principle of respect for human life. Therefore, abortion is seriously presumptively wrong.\n\n(C) generally permissible.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMarquis' theory also recognizes that there may be some situations in which it is morally permissible to violate a presumptively right principle, such as in cases of self-defense or in cases where the preservation of a greater good is at stake. However, Marquis does not believe that abortion falls into this category. Therefore, according to Marquis' theory, abortion is generally not permissible.\n\n(D) always permissible.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMarquis' theory does not allow for the possibility that abortion could ever be morally permissible.

This means that each person should have an equal right to the opportunities and resources that are necessary for them to pursue their own interests and goals, as long as they do not infringe on the equal liberty of others.\n\nTo determine which option best reflects this principle, we need to consider what it means to have an equal right to basic liberty. This means that each person should have an equal opportunity to pursue their own interests and goals, without being unfairly hindered by social or economic barriers.\n\nOption (A) does not reflect this principle, as it focuses on the happiness of the least happy person in society, rather than the basic liberty of all individuals. Option (B) also does not reflect this principle, as it focuses on the social and economic inequalities that are built into society, rather than the basic liberty of all individuals.\n\nOption (C) is more in line with the principle of greatest equal liberty, as it focuses on the opportunities and resources that belong to each person, rather than the social and economic inequalities that exist in society. However, it is important to note that these opportunities and resources should be available to all individuals, and not just to a select few, in order to ensure that everyone has an equal right to basic liberty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",
