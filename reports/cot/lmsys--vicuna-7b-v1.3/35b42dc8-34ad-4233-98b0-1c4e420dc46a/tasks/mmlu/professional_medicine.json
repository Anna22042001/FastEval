The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate next step in treatment for a 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis who has not responded to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sulfasalazine treatment would be to administer a drug that inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1).\n\nTNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory response and is overproduced in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 with biologic agents such as infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1.",

            "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the legal concepts involved in the scenario described. The patient is claiming that the surgical sponge was left in her pelvis during her hysterectomy, which resulted in her chronic pelvic pain. The plaintiff is alleging that the negligence of the healthcare provider caused the sponge to be left behind, and they are suing for malpractice.\n\n(A) Collateral estoppel refers to the legal principle that a party's previous judgment in a lawsuit precludes them from relitigating the same issue in a subsequent lawsuit. This is not applicable in this scenario.\n\n(B) Proximate cause refers to the legal requirement that the harm suffered by the plaintiff must be foreseeable as a result of the defendant's actions. This is also not applicable in this scenario, as the sponge being left behind is not a foreseeable outcome of the hysterectomy.\n\n(C) Res ipsa loquitur is a legal term that means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" It is used to establish negligence in cases where the harm suffered by the plaintiff is such that it could not have been caused by an act of the defendant, but only by some external force or event. In this scenario, the sponge being left behind is an external force that could not have been caused by the defendant's actions, and thus res ipsa loquitur could be invoked.\n\n(D) Respondeat superior is a legal term that means \"let the master answer.\" It is used to establish the liability of an employer for the actions of their employee, if the employee was acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the harm. This is not applicable in this scenario, as the healthcare provider is not the employer of the surgeon who performed the hysterectomy.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (C) res ipsa loquitur.",

This information will help to differentiate between potential causes of her abdominal pain and constipation, such as irritable bowel syndrome or other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nThe patient's request for a laxative also suggests that she may be experiencing constipation, which is a common symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.

The patient's hypertension and diabetes mellitus may contribute to her orthostatic hypotension. The physician should first consider adjusting her current medications to see if this improves her symptoms.\n\n(A) Cardiac stress scintigraphy is not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms are related to orthostatic hypotension, not cardiac causes.\n\n(C) Warfarin therapy is not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms are not related to a clotting disorder.\n\n(D) Transesophageal echocardiography is not indicated in this case as it is a more invasive procedure than the other options and is not necessary to diagnose or manage the patient's symptoms.",

In addition, hyperthyroidism can cause dilated ventricles, which can be seen on an MRI of the heart.
