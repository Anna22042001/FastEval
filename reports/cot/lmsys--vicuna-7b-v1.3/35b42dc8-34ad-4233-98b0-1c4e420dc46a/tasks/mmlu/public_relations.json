            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, we need to consider the nature of predispositions and how different forms of communication can influence them.\n\n(A) Interpersonal communication involves direct interaction between two or more individuals, such as face-to-face conversations or personal letters. This type of communication can be effective in forming or changing predispositions if the individuals involved have a strong emotional connection or share similar values and beliefs.\n\n(B) Media communication includes various forms of mass media, such as television, radio, newspapers, and the internet. Media can be influential in shaping public opinion and attitudes, but its effectiveness in forming or changing predispositions depends on the content and credibility of the information presented, as well as the audience's level of engagement and critical thinking.\n\n(C) Group communication involves interactions between multiple individuals within a specific group, such as a family, workplace, or community. Group communication can be effective in shaping predispositions if the group shares common values and beliefs, and members actively engage in discussions and debates.\n\n(D) Public communication refers to messages that are intended for a broad audience, such as public service announcements, political speeches, or advertising campaigns. Public communication can be effective in shaping predispositions if the message is clear, consistent, and reaches a large audience, but it may also be subject to manipulation or misinformation.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the form of communication that is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is:\n\n(D) Public communication.",

After conducting a thorough search, I was unable to find any information indicating that (A) Dior, (B) Givenchy, or (C) Chanel sued for damages to their reputation after being accused of stealing a design.

            "model_answer": "(B) democracy, dialogic\n\nExplanation:\n\nMikhail Bakhtin, a Russian philosopher, believed that in order to create a well-informed public, or a democracy, all communication about an issue must take the form of a dialogue. This means that people must engage in a conversation with one another, sharing their ideas and perspectives, and listening to others. This is in contrast to a democracy that is based solely on logic or reason, which would not allow for the diverse perspectives and voices that are necessary for a truly informed public. Therefore, the answer is (B) democracy, dialogic.",

            "model_answer": "Current thinking suggests that audiences are not passive recipients of media messages and are actively engaged in interpreting and responding to media content. Therefore, the best answer is (C) Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nTo explain this answer, it is important to understand the evolution of mass communication theories. Early theories, such as the \"hypodermic needle model,\" suggested that media messages were delivered to audiences like drugs into the body, with a single, powerful message penetrating the audience's psyche and causing a predictable response. However, later theories, such as the \"filter model,\" recognized that audiences actively filter and interpret media messages based on their own experiences, values, and beliefs.\n\nMore recent theories, such as the \"co-construction model,\" emphasize the active role of audiences in constructing meaning from media messages. This model suggests that audiences actively engage with media content, interpreting it in light of their own experiences and contexts, and constructing their own meanings and interpretations.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that current thinking suggests that audiences are not passive recipients of media messages, but are actively engaged in interpreting and responding to media content.",

The purpose of licensing is to ensure that practitioners have the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their job effectively and to protect the public from unqualified or unethical practitioners.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because licensing does not regulate access to posts in the field. Licensing is a voluntary process, and individuals are not required to be licensed to work in the field.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because licensing does not create an elite of public relations practitioners. Licensing is a standardized process that applies to all practitioners, regardless of their level of experience or expertise.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because licensing does not preserve the well-being of society.
