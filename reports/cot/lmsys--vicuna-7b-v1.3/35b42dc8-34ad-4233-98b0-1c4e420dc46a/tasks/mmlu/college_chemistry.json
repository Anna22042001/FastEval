            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is true about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands, we need to understand the concept of optical isomerism and how it relates to complexes.\n\nOptical isomerism refers to the phenomenon where a molecule has two or more forms that are mirror images of each other and cannot be superimposed. These forms are called enantiomers. In the context of complexes, the ligands can also be enantiomers, and if they are, the complex can display optical isomerism.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is false. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if the ligands are not identical.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is also false. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands are enantiomers.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is true. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is false. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even if they have only two different ligands.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (C).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider the principal quantum number, n, which represents the energy level. The allowed energy levels for an atom are determined by the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. In this case, the principal quantum number, n, is the quantum number that distinguishes the energy levels of the electrons in an atom.\n\nThe maximum number of electrons that can occupy a given energy level is determined by the principal quantum number, n, and the number of electrons in the atom is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus, which is 55 in this case. Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the 55Mn nucleus is 55.\n\nSince the Pauli exclusion principle applies to the electrons in the atom, the number of electrons that can occupy a given energy level is equal to the number of electrons in the atom. Therefore, the maximum number of electrons that can occupy the 55Mn nucleus is 55, which means that there are 55 energy levels available for the electrons in the 55Mn nucleus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 4.",
