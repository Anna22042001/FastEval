            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) conducting and magnetic materials.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, we will use induction heating and the properties of materials involved in the process. Induction heating is a process in which an alternating magnetic field is used to heat a conducting material. The heating occurs due to the eddy currents that are induced in the material by the changing magnetic field.\n\nNow, let's consider the materials involved in induction heating:\n\n(A) Conducting but non-magnetic materials: These materials do not have any magnetic properties and therefore cannot be magnetically induced. Therefore, they cannot be used for induction heating.\n\n(B) Conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials: These materials can be either magnetic or non-magnetic. If they are magnetic, they can be induced with a magnetic field, and if they are non-magnetic, they cannot be induced. Therefore, these materials can be used for induction heating, but only if they are magnetic.\n\n(C) Insulating materials: Insulating materials do not conduct electricity and therefore cannot be used for induction heating.\n\n(D) Conducting and magnetic materials: These materials can be induced with a magnetic field, and therefore, they can be used for induction heating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) conducting and magnetic materials.",

This energy is stored in the form of a latching current.\n3.
