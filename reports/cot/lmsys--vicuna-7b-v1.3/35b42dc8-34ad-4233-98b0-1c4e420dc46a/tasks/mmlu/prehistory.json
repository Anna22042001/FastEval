            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the name of a characteristic that is associated with a forward-thrusting lower face.\n\n(A) arboreal - This term is typically associated with animals that live in trees, such as arboreal animals. It does not describe a forward-thrusting lower face.\n\n(B) prognathous - This term is used to describe a forward-projecting jaw, such as in some primates and carnivores. It is a good fit for the characteristic described in the question.\n\n(C) diastema - This term refers to a space or gap between two teeth or teeth and the lip. It does not describe a forward-thrusting lower face.\n\n(D) mandible - This term refers to the lower jaw bone. It is not a characteristic of a forward-thrusting lower face.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) prognathous.",

It aims to understand the origins, evolution, and extinction of early human species, such as Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis, and Homo neanderthalensis.\n\n(B) Archaeology: This subfield of anthropology focuses on the study of past human societies through the analysis of material remains, such as artifacts, architecture, and environmental data. It aims to understand the development of human cultures, societies, and economies throughout history.\n\n(C) Primatology: This subfield of anthropology focuses on the study of primates, which includes monkeys, apes, and other related species. It aims to understand the behavior, ecology, and social organization of primates, as well as their evolutionary relationships with humans.\n\n(D) Linguistics: This subfield of anthropology focuses on the study of language and its structure, origins, and evolution. It aims to understand the relationship between language and culture, as well as the evolution of language across different populations and regions.\n\nBased on the main focus and scope of each subfield, the correct answer is (C) primatology.",

During this period, Mayan civilization reached its peak in terms of political organization, art, architecture, and scientific knowledge.\n\nBy 1900 BCE, the following elements were already present in Mayan culture:\n\n(A) stratified societies ruled by kings: Mayan civilization was characterized by a hierarchical social structure, with rulers at the top and common people at the bottom.\n\n(B) ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade: The Maya were known for their ball games, which were played as part of religious ceremonies and were an important part of their culture. They also valued jade as a symbol of status and power.\n\n(C) a sophisticated bronze producing industry: The Maya were skilled at producing bronze, which was used for tools, weapons, and religious objects.\n\n(D) a hieroglyphic written language and calendar: The Maya developed a complex writing system based on hieroglyphs, which they used to record historical events, astronomical observations, and other important information.

            "model_answer": "The wild progenitor of maize is (C) teosinte.\n\nThe reason for this answer is as follows:\n\nMaize, also known as corn, is a domesticated crop plant that originated from a wild grass species called teosinte. Teosinte is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is closely related to other cereal grains such as wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nTeosinte has a distinctive growth habit compared to domesticated maize. It has a more open, branching structure and a different arrangement of its ears on the stalk. These characteristics make it easy to distinguish teosinte from domesticated maize.\n\nTherefore, the wild progenitor of maize is (C) teosinte.",

            "model_answer": "(D) the hunting association\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn Mesopotamia, the institution that was set apart and had powers before the advent of social complexity was the temple. The temple was a sacred place where the gods were believed to reside, and it was often associated with the ruler or the state. The temple had its own officials and servants, and it was responsible for performing religious rituals and ceremonies.\n\nThe military, on the other hand, emerged during the early stages of social complexity in Mesopotamia. The state, which was responsible for governing the society, also emerged during this time. The state had its own officials and servants, and it was responsible for maintaining order and ensuring the safety of the people.\n\nThe hunting association, on the other hand, is not a Mesopotamian institution that existed before the advent of social complexity. Hunting was a popular activity in Mesopotamia, but it was not an institution that was set apart and had powers before the advent of social complexity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) the hunting association.",

This could be due to the need for planning, problem-solving, and coordination when making tools, which may have trained the brain to process and communicate complex information.\n\n(B) Tool making requires cooperation that can only exist with language.\n\nThis hypothesis suggests that tool making requires cooperation between individuals, and that language is necessary for effective cooperation. This could be because language allows individuals to communicate their ideas and plans, coordinate their actions, and resolve conflicts that may arise during the tool-making process.\n\n(C) Tool making originated millions of years after language evolved.\n\nThis hypothesis suggests that tool making emerged after language had already evolved. This could be because tool making is a more complex and sophisticated activity that requires a higher level of cognitive development than simple tool use.\n\n(D) Connections made between the brain and bipedal locomotion prepared the hands for tool making.\n\nThis hypothesis suggests that the development of bipedal locomotion, which allowed humans to walk upright and use their hands for more complex tasks, prepared the hands for tool making. This could be because bipedal locomotion allowed humans to use their hands for more precise and coordinated movements, which are necessary for tool making.\n\nBased on the available evidence, the hypothesis that best fits the research findings is (A).
