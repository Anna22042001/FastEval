            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the options listed is not a key management skill in planning, we need to consider the role of management in planning. Management is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities of an organization, and planning is a critical component of this process.\n\nConceptual skills are important in planning because they enable managers to develop a clear understanding of the organization's goals and objectives, as well as the resources and constraints that are available to achieve them. Analytical skills are also important because they enable managers to analyze data and information, identify trends and patterns, and make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and achieve their goals.\n\nIT and computing skills are not typically considered key management skills in planning because they are more closely associated with other areas of management, such as information technology and data analysis. However, they may be relevant in certain contexts, such as when planning the implementation of a new IT system or when analyzing data to inform decision-making.\n\nCommunication skills are essential in planning because they enable managers to effectively communicate their goals and objectives to other members of the organization, as well as to external stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, and regulators. Without effective communication, it is difficult for managers to coordinate their activities and achieve their goals.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that is not a key management skill in planning is (D) Communication skills. The answer is \"D\" as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the answer, we need to understand the characteristics of each type of culture mentioned in the question.\n\n(A) Team culture: A team culture is one in which individuals are organized into teams or groups that work together to achieve a common goal. In such a culture, workers may be more accepting of change if it is seen as benefiting the team or improving team performance.\n\n(B) Collaborative culture: A collaborative culture is one in which individuals are encouraged to work together and share ideas to achieve a common goal. In such a culture, workers may be more accepting of change if it is seen as a way to improve collaboration and teamwork.\n\n(C) Group culture: A group culture is one in which individuals are organized into groups based on shared characteristics or interests. In such a culture, workers may be more accepting of change if it is seen as benefiting the group or improving group cohesion.\n\n(D) Collective culture: A collective culture is one in which individuals are seen as part of a larger collective or community, and the interests of the collective are prioritized over individual interests. In such a culture, workers may be more accepting of change if it is seen as benefiting the collective or improving the well-being of the community.\n\nBased on these characteristics, it is likely that workers' acceptance of change is more likely in a collective culture (D) than in a team culture (A), collaborative culture (B), or group culture (C). Therefore, the answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Retaining the status quo is not a characteristic of a corporate social responsibility framework.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework is a set of principles and guidelines that a company follows to ensure that its operations are socially and environmentally responsible. A characteristic of a CSR framework is that it should be forward-looking and not just focused on maintaining the status quo. Therefore, option (A) is not a characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\n(B) Understanding society is a characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA CSR framework should take into account the needs and expectations of the society in which the company operates. Therefore, understanding society is an important characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\n(C) Harnessing diversity is not a characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhile diversity is important in a CSR framework, the focus is on ensuring that the company's operations are socially and environmentally responsible, rather than just harnessing diversity for its own sake. Therefore, option (C) is not a characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\n(D) Building capacity is a characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA CSR framework should aim to build the capacity of the communities in which the company operates. This means that the company should work to improve the skills and capabilities of the local population, so that they can benefit from the company's operations. Therefore, building capacity is an important characteristic of a CSR framework.\n\nAnswer: (D) Building capacity",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which writer is most associated with bureaucratic structures, we need to consider the works of each of the given writers and their contributions to the field of organizational theory.\n\n(A) Henry Fayol: Fayol is known for his 14 principles of management, which include concepts such as division of work, authority, discipline, and unity of command. While these principles are not specifically focused on bureaucratic structures, they do contribute to the development of a more efficient and organized workplace, which is a key aspect of bureaucratic structures.\n\n(B) Max Weber: Weber is known for his work on bureaucracy, which he defined as a system of administration characterized by a clear division of labor, a hierarchical structure, and a set of rules and regulations. Weber's work on bureaucracy is extensive and includes studies of the development of bureaucratic organizations in various countries.\n\n(C) Adam Smith: Smith is known for his work on the division of labor and the role of the invisible hand in the market economy. While his work is not specifically focused on bureaucratic structures, it does contribute to the development of a more efficient and organized workplace, which is a key aspect of bureaucratic structures.\n\n(D) Mary Parker Follett: Follett is known for her work on the concept of \"integrative bargaining,\" which emphasizes the importance of building consensus and finding common ground in decision-making. While her work is not specifically focused on bureaucratic structures, it does contribute to the development of a more collaborative and efficient workplace, which is a key aspect of bureaucratic structures.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the writer most associated with bureaucratic structures is (B) Max Weber.",

It could simply mean that two partners have decided to collaborate without necessarily buying out each other's shares.\n\n(B) Two equal partners share resources does not necessarily involve an acquisition.
