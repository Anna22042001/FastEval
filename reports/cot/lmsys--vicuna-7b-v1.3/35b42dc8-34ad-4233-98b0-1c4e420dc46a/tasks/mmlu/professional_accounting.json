            "model_answer": "The successor auditor would ask the predecessor auditor to provide (D) matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years.\n\nThe reason for this is that the successor auditor needs to assess whether the financial statements of the current year are consistent with those of the prior year. This involves evaluating the accounting policies and principles used, as well as any changes in accounting estimates or judgments. The predecessor auditor's knowledge of these matters can be helpful in identifying any potential issues that may need to be addressed during the audit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

The net income is given as $11,000.\n\nNext, we need to find the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The net cumulative effect is positive, which means Palmyra Co. had a change in accounting principle that increased its net income.

In this case, the borrowed amount is $200,000, the interest rate is 10%, and the number of years is 1.

Using the formula for the risk-free rate, we can find the expected market return:\n\nRm = (0.10 \\* (1 + 0.07)^2) / (0.07) = 10.07%\n\nNext, we need to find the beta of Stock B. The beta of Stock B is given as 1.4. To find the beta of the market, we can use the formula:\n\n\u03b2m = (Rm - Rf) / \u03c3m\n\nwhere \u03c3m is the standard deviation of the market.
