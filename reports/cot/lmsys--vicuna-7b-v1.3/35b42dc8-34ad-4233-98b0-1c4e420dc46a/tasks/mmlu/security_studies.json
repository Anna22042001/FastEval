            "question": "What are the themes that make post-structuralism a different field of study and why is it criticized?\n\n(A) One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.\n(B) Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy.\n(C) A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.\n(D) Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate. This has brought it into confrontation with the critical studies community, having little to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which knowledge is constructed.",

            "question": "Since the end of the Cold War, how has the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers changed?\n\n(A) Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\n(B) The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\n(C) The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.\n(D) The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.",

Whilst Critical Security Studies is post-structuralist and constructivist, the Copenhagen School is based on an objectivist epistemology.\n(B) Whilst Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society, the Copenhagen school disregards this epistemological approach and instead considers security as an issue to be studied objectively from a positivist approach.\n(C) Critical Security Studies regards security to be an empirically definable state, which should be studied from a positivist approach.

            "model_answer": "(D) War is a state of mass conflict which is inflicted upon state actors as a result of their failure to effectively control the behavior of their population.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWar, military security, and security studies are interconnected concepts that are often studied together. War is a state of mass conflict that involves the use of military force between two or more groups or nations. Military security refers to the protection of a state's territory, population, and interests from external threats, including military attacks. Security studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that examines the ways in which states and other actors seek to ensure their security, including through the use of military force.\n\nOption (D) suggests that war is a result of state actors' failure to effectively control the behavior of their population. This is consistent with the idea that war is often driven by political or economic factors, such as the pursuit of resources or the desire to maintain power. For example, a state may go to war if its population is dissatisfied with the government's policies or if it is facing economic challenges that threaten its stability.\n\nOverall, option (D) provides a useful framework for understanding the relationship between war, military security, and security studies. It highlights the importance of understanding the underlying political and economic factors that drive conflict, and the role that states and other actors play in shaping the course of war.",

However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\n(B) Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\n(C) The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\n(D) The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security.

The unpredictability of chemicals (the degree of evaporation, stability and concentration) frequently proves to be incommensurate with political objectives.\n\nExplanation: Chemical weapons are not always reliable and can be difficult to control, which makes them a risky choice for military use. The unpredictable nature of chemicals can make it difficult to achieve the desired outcome, which can be a deterrent for using them.\n\n(B) Analysts are concerned with the potential ease of chemical manufacturing.
