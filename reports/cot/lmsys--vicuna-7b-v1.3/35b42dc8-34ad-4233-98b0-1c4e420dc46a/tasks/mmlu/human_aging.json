            "model_answer": "The program that takes over care for those with 6 or fewer months to live, attempts to keep them at home, provides pain relief, and ends all life-prolonging technologies is called (D) Hospice.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHospice is a type of care that is provided to people who are in the advanced stages of a terminal illness and have a prognosis of 6 months or less to live. The goal of hospice care is to provide comfort and support to the patient and their family, and to help the patient live as comfortably as possible during the remaining time they have. Hospice care typically involves a team of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and social workers, who work together to provide medical, emotional, and spiritual support to the patient and their family.\n\nOne of the key components of hospice care is the use of pain relief medications to help manage the patient's symptoms and improve their quality of life. Hospice care also involves helping the patient and their family to make decisions about end-of-life care, including whether or not to use life-prolonging technologies such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis.\n\nTherefore, the program that takes over care for those with 6 or fewer months to live, attempts to keep them at home, provides pain relief, and ends all life-prolonging technologies is called hospice.",

            "model_answer": "(D) Change the home environment for the bereaved\n\nExplanation:\n\nSurveys of bereaved individuals have found that one of the things that is reported as being most helpful is when others provide emotional support and comfort during the grieving process. This can include offering practical help, such as preparing meals or running errands, as well as simply being present and available to listen.\n\nOption (A) is not necessarily helpful, as avoiding any discussion of the deceased can make the bereaved person feel isolated and disconnected from others. Option (B) can be helpful in some cases, as maintaining close contact with the bereaved person can provide a sense of continuity and support. However, it is not always appropriate or necessary, and can also be overwhelming or intrusive. Option (C) is not helpful, as it can make the bereaved person feel like they are being abandoned or ignored.\n\nOption (D) is not necessarily helpful, as changing the home environment of the bereaved person can be disruptive and may not be practical or feasible in some cases. However, making small changes to the home environment, such as adding a memorial or creating a special space for the bereaved person to grieve, can be comforting and supportive.\n\nTherefore, the most helpful option is (D), but it should be done with sensitivity and consideration for the needs and preferences of the bereaved person.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can help you with that. Let's break down the question step-by-step.\n\nThe question asks us to identify which of the following statements is true:\n\n(A) Older workers are more likely to be absent from work.\n(B) Older workers are more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs.\n(C) Older workers are more likely to be less productive.\n(D) Older workers are more likely to be laid off.\n\nTo determine the answer, we need to consider the characteristics of older workers and how they may differ from younger workers.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age range of older workers. Generally, older workers are defined as those over the age of 45 or 50, depending on the context. In contrast, younger workers are typically defined as those under the age of 45 or 50.\n\nNext, let's consider the reasons why older workers might be more likely to experience certain outcomes. For example, older workers may be more likely to be absent from work due to health issues or other personal reasons. They may also be more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs due to changes in their physical or mental abilities, or due to changes in their career goals or aspirations.\n\nOn the other hand, older workers may be less productive due to changes in their physical or mental abilities, or due to changes in their work habits or attitudes. They may also be more likely to be laid off due to changes in their industry or due to changes in their employer's workforce.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the statement that is most likely to be true is:\n\n(D) Older workers are more likely to be laid off.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

While mental stimulation, exercise, and a healthy diet are all important for maintaining good health, they are not the primary determinant of lifespan. Good genes, which are determined by our genetic makeup, can provide a strong foundation for health and longevity.\n\nSocial support (B) and avoiding stress (D) are also important factors for overall health and well-being, but they are not directly related to lifespan.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Talk about your loss.\n\nThe Senior View section in this chapter features Tat Kleckley, who is an expert in grief and loss. Based on his experience and expertise, he believes that the most important part of the healing process for those who are bereaved is to talk about their loss. This is because talking about the loss can help the person process their emotions and come to terms with their grief. It also allows them to share their story with others and receive support from others who have gone through similar experiences.\n\nIn contrast, options (A) and (D) are not recommended by Kleckley. Staying away from other people for a while can isolate the person further and make their grief more difficult to manage. Making new friends who don't know about their loss may not provide the necessary support and understanding that they need during this difficult time.\n\nOption (B) getting out and being active may be helpful for some people, but it is not necessarily the most important part of the healing process. It is important to find activities that are meaningful and enjoyable for the person, rather than forcing them to participate in activities that they don't enjoy.",
