            "model_answer": "To find the work done by F on the particle, we need to calculate the dot product of F and the displacement vector of the particle. The displacement vector of the particle is given by the path (t, t^2, t^3), which is a line in 3D space.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of the path with respect to time. The derivative of t^n with respect to t is t^(n-1). Therefore, the derivative of (t, t^2, t^3) with respect to t is (1, 2t, 3t^2).\n\nNext, we need to find the cross product of F and the displacement vector of the particle. The cross product of two vectors A and B is given by A \u00d7 B = (AyBz - AzBy, AzBx - AxBz, AxBy - AyBx).\n\nUsing the cross product formula, we can find the displacement vector of the particle as (1, 2t, 3t^2) \u00d7 (1, 0, 1) = (2t, 6t^2, 3t^3).\n\nNow we can find the dot product of F and the displacement vector of the particle as F \u00d7 (2t, 6t^2, 3t^3) = (2, 18t^2, 18t^3).\n\nFinally, we can find the work done by F on the particle by multiplying the dot product by the magnitude of F and integrating over the path from t=0 to t=1. The magnitude of F is |F| = 1.\n\nTherefore, the work done by F on the particle is (2, 18t^2, 18t^3) \u00b7 (1, 0, 1) \u222b[0,1] (2, 18t^2, 18t^3) d(t^2) = (2, 18t^2, 18t^3) \u222b[0,1] (2t, 6t^2, 3t^3) d(t^2) = (2, 18t^2, 18t^3) \u222b[0,1] (2t, 6t^2) d(t^2) = (2, 18t^2, 18t^3) (1/3) = (2/3, 18t^2/3, 18t^3/3).\n\nThe final answer is (D) sqrt(2).",
