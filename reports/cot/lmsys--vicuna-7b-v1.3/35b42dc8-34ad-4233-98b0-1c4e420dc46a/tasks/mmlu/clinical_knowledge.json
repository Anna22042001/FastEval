            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.\n\nThe reason for this is that during diastole, the left ventricle relaxes and the pressure inside the ventricle decreases, causing the arterial walls to move away from each other. This results in a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the arteries, which causes a decrease in blood pressure. However, the elasticity of the arterial walls causes them to recoil and move back towards each other, which increases the cross-sectional area of the arteries and increases the blood pressure. This recoil force is what keeps the blood flowing through the vessels even when the left ventricle is relaxed.\n\nThe atria are in diastole during this time, so (A) is not correct. The vessels are also in diastole, so (B) is not correct. The right ventricle is also in diastole during this time, so (C) is not correct.",

            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: This statement is true. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland and can cause hyperthyroidism. One of the common symptoms of Graves' disease is ophthalmoplegia, which is the involuntary movement of the eyes.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: This statement is false. Graves' disease typically causes a single, large goiter, which is called a toxic diffuse goiter. It is characterized by the presence of thyroid hormone receptors on the thyroid follicular cells, which stimulate the thyroid gland to produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones.\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females: This statement is false. Graves' disease is more common in women than men. It affects approximately 5-10% of the general population, with a higher prevalence in women.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': This statement is false. The term \"Derbyshire Neck\" is not a medical condition, but rather a term used to describe a type of goiter that was named after the location where it was first described. It is not caused by Graves' disease.\n\nAnswer: A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen a nerve stimulus is applied to a muscle fiber, it causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. This increase in calcium ions binds to the troponin protein on the actin filament, causing the tropomyosin to shift and expose the binding sites on the actin filament for myosin. This allows myosin to bind to the actin filament and initiate muscle contraction.\n\nWhen the nerve stimulus is removed, the calcium ions are no longer bound to the troponin protein and the tropomyosin returns to its original position, covering the actin binding sites. This causes the myosin to release from the actin filament and the muscle fiber to relax.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is (C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nExplanation:\n\nHigh intensity exercise requires a large amount of energy to be produced and used quickly. This energy is primarily stored in the form of ATP, which is the primary source of energy for muscles. However, during intense exercise, the demand for ATP exceeds the rate at which it can be produced, leading to a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. This results in fatigue and a decrease in performance.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a fall in the cell concentration of ADP does not directly cause fatigue. ADP is a byproduct of glycolysis and is not directly involved in energy production.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because inhibition of ATP production would also lead to a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand, resulting in fatigue.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because lack of skill is not a direct cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. Fatigue is primarily caused by the demand for energy exceeding the rate at which it can be produced.",

Alterations in dopamine and acetylcholine can impact fatigue, but the specific alterations are not well understood.\n\n(C) Glutamate and serotonin: Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, while serotonin is involved in mood, appetite, and sleep regulation. Alterations in glutamate and serotonin can impact fatigue, but the specific alterations are not well understood.\n\n(D) Dopamine and serotonin: Dopamine and serotonin are both involved in mood, motivation, and reward. Alterations in dopamine and serotonin levels and activity can impact fatigue development. For example, decreased dopamine activity has been linked to fatigue, while increased serotonin activity has been linked to fatigue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

The severity of the pressure: The more severe the pressure, the more likely it is that damage will occur.\n3. The patient's condition: Some patients may be more susceptible to pressure damage than others.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that the longer the patient has been on the operating table, the more likely it is that pressure damage will be visible. Additionally, the more severe the pressure, the more likely it is that damage will occur.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate options (A) and (D) as they do not take into account the duration of pressure and the severity of the pressure.\n\nOption (B) suggests that pressure damage will be visible after 72 hours, which is too long a timeframe.\n\nOption (C) suggests that pressure damage will be visible after 24 hours, which is too short a timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 24 hours.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The resynthesis of phosphocreatine is a crucial process for recovery after high-intensity exercise. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound found in muscle cells that helps to replenish ATP, the primary energy currency of the body. The resynthesis of phosphocreatine can be divided into two phases: the synthesis phase and the dephosphorylation phase.\n\nThe synthesis phase involves the conversion of creatine phosphate (CP) to phosphocreatine (PCr) in the muscle cell. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase (CK) and requires the input of ATP. The synthesis of PCr is a rate-limiting step in the recovery process, as the rate of PCr synthesis is limited by the availability of ATP.\n\nThe dephosphorylation phase involves the conversion of PCr back to CP in the muscle cell. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase (CK) and does not require the input of ATP. The rate of dephosphorylation is determined by the concentration of PCr and the availability of CK.\n\nBased on these considerations, the resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 4 minutes, depending on the rate of PCr synthesis and dephosphorylation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) about 1 minute.",

While MS can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, it is not typically associated with spastic paraplegia.\n\n(B) Spastic paraplegia is characterized by spasticity in the lower limbs, which is a muscle hypertonicity or stiffness. Proprioceptive loss is not a common feature of spastic paraplegia.\n\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected in spastic paraplegia due to the spasticity and muscle rigidity, which can lead to difficulty in walking and other movements.\n\n(D) The tone of the muscles in spastic paraplegia is either hypertonic (flaccid) or hypotonic (rigid), depending on the underlying cause.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) insulin.\n\nThe process of glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is activated by insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. When glucose levels in the blood are high, insulin is released to help transport glucose into cells, where it can be used for energy. During exercise, the muscles require more energy, and insulin helps to facilitate the breakdown of glycogen, which is stored in the muscles, into glucose for energy.\n\nCortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress, and it can also play a role in the breakdown of glycogen in the muscles. However, this process is not the primary mechanism for glycogen breakdown during exercise. An increase in pH is not a factor in glycogen breakdown either.
