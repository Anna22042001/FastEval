            "model_answer": "To estimate the product 32 x 68, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Start by estimating the factors of each number. 32 can be broken down into 2s (32/2 = 16), and 68 can be broken down into 2s (68/2 = 34).\n2. Next, we can use the following multiplication estimate: if the sum of the factors of each number is around 10, then the product is likely to be between 10 and 20 times the sum of the factors.\n3. Using this estimate, we can calculate the range of possible products:\n* For 32, the sum of its factors is 16 + 34 = 50. So, the range of possible products is 10 to 20 times 50, which is 500 to 1000.\n* For 68, the sum of its factors is 34 + 34 = 68. So, the range of possible products is 10 to 20 times 68, which is 680 to 1360.\n4. Since the sum of the factors of 32 is less than 10, and the sum of the factors of 68 is less than 10, we can conclude that the product 32 x 68 is likely to be between 680 and 1360.\n5. Therefore, the answer is (D) 18,000 and 28,000.",

Since Bus A leaves every 75 minutes, the next time it will leave the station will be 75 minutes plus the time interval between the next departure of Bus A and the next departure of Bus B. Similarly, since Bus B leaves every 15 minutes, the next time it will leave the station will be 15 minutes plus the time interval between the next departure of Bus A and the next departure of Bus B.\n\nLet's call the time when this time interval occurs \"t\".
