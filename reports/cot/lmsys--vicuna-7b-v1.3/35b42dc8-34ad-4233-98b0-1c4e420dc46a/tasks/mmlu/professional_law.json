            "question": "An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?\n\n(A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer, we need to consider the legal principles involved in this situation.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether the developer is liable for the damage to the investor's building. If the developer removed necessary support for the investor's lot, then she may be liable.\n\nNext, we need to consider whether the developer can be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed. In most jurisdictions, liability can only be established if negligence is proved. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) - the developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n\nFinally, we need to consider whether the investor's action to recover damages is valid. If the investor's building suffered damage due to the developer's negligence, then the investor may be able to recover damages. However, if the damage was caused by some other factor, such as natural subsidence, then the investor may not be able to recover damages. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) - the investor cannot invoke the right of lateral support once land is improved with a building.",

            "question": "An incumbent was running for re-election as the mayor of a city. During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\n(B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n(C) inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\n(D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n\nThe reason for this is that the television correspondent was present when the opponent made the statement about the mayor propositioning a prostitute. Her firsthand knowledge of the statement would be considered an exception to the hearsay rule, which generally prohibits the introduction of statements made out of court by a non-testifying witness. In this case, the statement made by the opponent during the campaign speech would be considered hearsay, but the exception to the hearsay rule would apply because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the television correspondent's testimony would be admissible in court as evidence of the opponent's statement about the mayor propositioning a prostitute.",

            "question": "At 1:00 a. m. one night, two police officers were driving past a tavern when they noticed a man vomiting outside. They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely\n\n(A) recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.\n(B) recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.\n(C) not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.\n(D) not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.",

            "model_answer": "(D) not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe police officers had a duty to take care of the man and not to cause him harm. However, they did not take reasonable care in dropping him off at a dangerous location. Therefore, the man can assert a claim of negligence against the police department.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the police should have realized that it was dangerous to drop the man off at that location.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off, but that does not necessarily mean they were negligent in doing so.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the man's choice to be driven to the city limits does not absolve the police of their duty to take care of him and not cause him harm.\n\nOption (D) is correct because the motorist's act of striking the man was a supervening cause of his injury, which means it occurred independently of the police's actions and is therefore not something for which the police can be held liable.",

If Mary had a valid will, it would have superseded the rules of intestate succession. However, since Mary did not have a valid will, we will look to the laws of intestate succession to determine how her estate will be distributed.\n\nFlorida follows the laws of intestate succession, which means that if someone dies without a will, their assets will be distributed according to a predetermined set of rules. In Mary's case, since she had only one child, Joan, and no surviving spouse or other relatives, the entire estate will pass to Joan.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 100% to Joan.",

Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills. Medical evidence established that the patient would have lived longer had the drug been at full strength, but would have died before long in any event. The president was convicted of murder. On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\n(A) No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\n(B) No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\n(C) Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\n(D) Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.",

A defeasible fee simple is a type of land ownership where the owner has the right to possess and use the land, but the ownership can be revoked if certain conditions are not met. However, the fact that the uncle has the right to remove oil from the 200-acre tract does not necessarily mean that this right is an incident of a defeasible fee simple.\n\n(B) The personal assistant has an interest in the 200-acre tract, as they were conveyed the property by the rancher in 1997.\n\n(C) The fact that the uncle acted in bad faith is not relevant to the question of whether the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\n(D) The right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession. This is because the uncle has the right to remove the oil from the property, and this right is related to the possession of the property. The fact that the uncle removed the oil without notice to the personal assistant suggests that he believed he had the right to do so, and this right is related to the possession of the property.",
