            "model_answer": "The question asks for the number of human protein-coding genes, which are genes that code for proteins. The number of protein-coding genes in the human genome has been a subject of ongoing research and estimation.\n\n(A) 10,000\u201315,000: This estimate was based on early studies of the human genome, which identified a relatively small number of protein-coding genes. However, subsequent studies have identified many more protein-coding genes, leading to a revised estimate of around 20,000 protein-coding genes.\n\n(B) 19,000\u201320,000: This estimate is based on more recent studies of the human genome, which have identified a larger number of protein-coding genes than earlier estimates.\n\n(C) 29,000\u201330,000: This estimate is based on even more recent studies of the human genome, which have identified a still larger number of protein-coding genes.\n\n(D) 100,000: This estimate is much higher than the current estimate of protein-coding genes in the human genome. It is based on a study that identified a large number of non-coding RNAs, which are not necessarily protein-coding genes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 29,000\u201330,000.",

            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of a substitution.\n\nExplanation:\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation is a substitution of the nucleotide guanine (G) for adenine (A) at position 508 in the CFTR gene. This substitution results in the production of a faulty CFTR protein that causes the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and other organs, leading to respiratory and digestive problems.\n\nTherefore, the most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of a substitution of the nucleotide guanine (G) for adenine (A) at position 508 in the CFTR gene.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is (D) Almost 100%.\n\nHere is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which results in the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body.\n2. PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means that an individual must inherit two copies of the gene (one from each parent) to develop the disorder.\n3. If both parents are carriers of the PKU gene (i.e., they have one copy of the gene), then there is a 25% chance that their offspring will inherit two copies of the gene and develop PKU.\n4. If only one parent is a carrier of the PKU gene, then there is a 50% chance that their offspring will inherit one copy of the gene and be a carrier, and a 50% chance that their offspring will not inherit the gene and be unaffected.\n5. Therefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is almost 100%, since the mother has already demonstrated a deficiency in the enzyme and is likely to pass the gene on to her offspring.\n\nThe answer is (D) Almost 100%.",

QTL analysis is a method used to identify these regions by studying the inheritance of traits in a genetic cross. In a genetic cross, two or more genetically distinct populations are crossed to produce offspring that inherit a combination of alleles from each parent. By studying the phenotypic variation in the offspring, QTL analysis can identify regions of the genome that are associated with a particular trait.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(D) is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAn Hfr (high frequency of recombination) strain of E. coli is a strain of E. coli that has been genetically engineered to have a higher frequency of recombination between homologous regions of the bacterial chromosome. This increased frequency of recombination allows for the rapid generation of many copies of a particular DNA sequence, which can be useful in various applications such as genetic engineering and molecular biology.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a vector of yeast or bacterial origin is not used to make many copies of a particular DNA sequence in an Hfr strain of E. coli. Instead, the Hfr strain has a higher frequency of recombination between homologous regions of the bacterial chromosome, which allows for the rapid generation of many copies of a particular DNA sequence.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because an Hfr strain of E. coli does not have a bacterial chromosome with a human gene inserted.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because an Hfr strain of E. coli does not have the F factor inserted. The F factor is a plasmid that is commonly used in molecular biology to transfer genetic material between different strains of E. coli.\n\nOption (D) is correct because a human chromosome with a transposable element inserted is not a characteristic of an Hfr strain of E. coli. However, an Hfr strain of E. coli does have a higher frequency of recombination between homologous regions of the bacterial chromosome, which allows for the rapid generation of many copies of a particular DNA sequence.",
