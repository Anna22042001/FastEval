We need to find the area of the rectangle. The rectangle has height 2 and width 3 - 0 = 3 - 0 = 3. So, the area of the rectangle is 3 \\* 2 = 6 square units.\n2. We need to find the total area of the plane. The total area of the plane is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,2), and (3,2). The area of the triangle is 1/2 \\* (3 - 0) \\* (2 - 0) = 1/2 \\* 3 \\* 2 = 3 square units.\n3. So, the total area of the plane is 6 + 3 = 9 square units.\n4. Now we can find the probability that $x < y$. This happens when $x$ is less than or equal to $y$. So, we need to divide the area of the rectangle by the total area of the plane.\n5. The area of the rectangle is 6 square units.\n6. The total area of the plane is 9 square units.\n7. So, the probability that $x < y$ is 6 / 9 = 1/3.\n8. Therefore, the answer is (D) \\frac{1}{3}.",
