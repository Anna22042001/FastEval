In Christianity, there are two sacraments that are universally recognized and celebrated by all denominations: Baptism and Eucharist.\n\nBaptism is the sacrament of initiation, in which an individual is washed clean of their sins and welcomed into the church. It is typically administered to infants, but can also be administered to adults and children who have not been baptized.\n\nEucharist, also known as Communion or the Lord's Supper, is the sacrament of unity, in which believers partake in the body and blood of Christ as a symbol of their faith and communion with one another.\n\nOptions (B) and (D) are not sacraments in the traditional Christian sense. Option (B) is the sacrament of ordination, in which individuals are consecrated as ministers or priests. Option (D) is the sacrament of confession, in which individuals confess their sins to a priest and receive absolution.
