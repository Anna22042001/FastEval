            "model_answer": "To determine the most appropriate statement, we need to use the standard deviation to calculate the range of possible values for the average donation in November.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the range of possible values for the average donation in November using the standard deviation.\n\nThe standard deviation of $32 means that the values of the donations are spread out by $32 on either side of the mean. Therefore, the range of possible values for the average donation in November is from $155 - $32 = $123 to $155 + $32 = $187.\n\nStep 2: Determine the range of possible values for the average donation in November given the information provided.\n\nWe are given that the average donation in November is $155. Therefore, the lower limit of the range is $155.\n\nWe are also given that the standard deviation is $32. Therefore, the upper limit of the range is $187.\n\nStep 3: Compare the range of possible values for the average donation in November to the range calculated in Step 2.\n\nThe range calculated in Step 2 is $123 to $187. This is wider than the range of possible values for the average donation in November, which is only $155 to $187.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement is:\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.",

The teachers' union wants to receive more money, while the school district wants to pay as little as possible.\n\nOption (A) - The mean of all the salaries - would not be the most relevant statistic for the teachers' union to quote because the mean only takes into account the highest and lowest salaries, which may not accurately represent the typical salary of the teachers. The mean may be inflated by the high salaries of a few highly paid administrators, which the district would use to argue that they are already paying a fair wage.\n\nOption (B) - The mode of all the salaries - would not be the most relevant statistic for the teachers' union to quote because the mode is the most frequently occurring value, but it may not be representative of the typical salary. For example, if there are a few extremely high salaries that are not typical, they would still be included in the mode, which would not accurately represent the typical salary.\n\nOption (C) - The standard deviation of all the salaries - would not be the most relevant statistic for the teachers' union to quote because it measures the spread of the data, but it does not provide information about the typical salary. The standard deviation may be inflated by the high salaries of a few highly paid administrators, which the district would use to argue that they are already paying a fair wage.\n\nOption (D) - The median of all the salaries - would be the most relevant statistic for the teachers' union to quote because it is the middle value of the salaries, and it represents the typical salary. If the median is lower than the district's proposed salary, the teachers' union can argue that the proposed salary is not fair and that the district has the financial resources to pay more.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) - The median of all the salaries.",
