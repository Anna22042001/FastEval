            "model_answer": "The enlightened self-interest model of CSR suggests that it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way. This model argues that by doing so, an organization can create long-term value for itself and its stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the community.\n\nTo achieve this, organizations need to balance their own interests with the interests of their stakeholders. This means that organizations should consider the impact of their actions on all stakeholders and take steps to ensure that their actions are ethical and responsible.\n\nIn this sense, the enlightened self-interest model of CSR is similar to the stakeholder theory of CSR, which argues that organizations should consider the interests of all stakeholders when making decisions. However, the enlightened self-interest model places more emphasis on the idea that acting ethically can create long-term value for the organization.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) That it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Professional, Organizational, Personal, Organizational\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn a business to business context, conflicts of interest can arise in two main ways: conflict of professional and organizational interests, and conflict of personal and organizational interests.\n\nConflict of professional and organizational interests can arise when a firm is hired as a supplier of professional services by another firm. For example, if a law firm is hired by a client to provide legal services, there may be a conflict of interest if the law firm's own interests conflict with the interests of the client.\n\nConflict of personal and organizational interests can arise when an individual's interests may conflict with that of their employer. For example, if an employee is also a shareholder in a company, there may be a conflict of interest if the employee's personal interests conflict with the interests of the company.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Professional, Organizational, Personal, Organizational.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer for \"Predatory pricing,\" we need to understand what it means and how it can be applied. Predatory pricing is a strategy used by a company to drive its competitors out of business by selling products or services at a price lower than the cost of production, with the intention of gaining a monopoly in the market.\n\nThere are several factors to consider when analyzing predatory pricing:\n\n1. The initial price: The lower the initial price, the more likely it is that the company is engaging in predatory pricing.\n2. The company's financial position: If the company can afford to sustain the losses incurred by the low prices, it may be engaging in predatory pricing.\n3. The duration of the pricing strategy: If the low prices are maintained for an extended period, it may indicate that the company is using predatory pricing.\n4. The company's market share: If the company's market share increases significantly after implementing the predatory pricing strategy, it may indicate that the company is using predatory pricing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 1,2,4: This option does not make sense, as it does not consider the factors mentioned above.\n\n(B) 1,2,3,4: This option is incorrect because it does not consider the duration of the pricing strategy.\n\n(C) 1,2: This option is incorrect because it only considers the initial price, which is not sufficient to determine if the pricing strategy is predatory.\n\n(D) 1,4: This option is incorrect because it only considers the company's market share, which is not sufficient to determine if the pricing strategy is predatory.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is (D) 1,4.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Healthy and safe working conditions\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe text mentions that the concern for the Right to Healthy and Safe Working Conditions has been a long-standing ethical concern for employees, and that this concern is addressed through a dense network of occupational health, safety, and environmental regulations that companies must abide by. This suggests that the focus of the concern is on the working conditions themselves, rather than on other aspects such as work-life balance or employee privacy.\n\nOption (A) is not mentioned in the text, and therefore cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption (C) is also not mentioned in the text, and therefore cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) is mentioned in the text, but only in passing, and is not the main focus of the concern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Healthy and safe working conditions.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) Top, Standardisation, Political, Economic.\n\nThe race to the top is a phenomenon where countries compete for foreign investment by weakening their labor and environmental standards. This is done by standardizing regulations and practices across countries to make them more attractive to investors. This can lead to a race to the bottom, where countries compete to have the lowest labor and environmental standards in order to attract investment.\n\nThe race to the top is often driven by globalization, which increases the flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. This can create a competitive environment where countries must attract investment in order to grow their economies. In response, they may weaken their labor and environmental standards in order to make themselves more attractive to investors.\n\nThe race to the top can have negative consequences, such as lower labor and environmental standards, which can lead to poor working conditions and environmental degradation. However, it can also have positive effects, such as increased economic growth and job creation.\n\n(A) Bottom, Globalisation, Social, Environmental - This option is incorrect because it refers to a race to the bottom, not a race to the top.\n\n(B) Top, Globalisation, Political, Environmental - This option is incorrect because it refers to a race to the bottom, not a race to the top.\n\n(C) Bottom, Standardisation, Social, Economic - This option is incorrect because it refers to a race to the bottom, not a race to the top.\n\n(D) Top, Standardisation, Political, Economic - This option is correct because it refers to a race to the top, where countries compete to have the most attractive labor and environmental standards in order to attract investment.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(A) Legislation, Sarbanes-Oxley Act: This option is incorrect because legislation is not a key factor in driving ethical business practices. It is a legal requirement that must be followed, but it does not necessarily drive ethical behavior.\n\n(B) Internal company policy, Unethical corporate practices act: This option is incorrect because internal company policies are not necessarily effective in driving ethical behavior. They may be in place, but they may not be enforced or followed.\n\n(D) Legislation, Unethical corporate practices act: This option is incorrect because it is the opposite of what is meant by the question. Legislation is not a key factor in driving ethical business practices; rather, ethical business practices are a requirement of the law.\n\n(C) Internal company policy, Sarbanes-Oxley Act: This option is correct because internal company policies, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, can be a key factor in driving ethical business practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a federal law that sets standards for the financial industry and requires companies to follow ethical practices. By having these policies in place, companies are more likely to follow ethical practices and avoid unethical behavior.",

Individual factors relate to the unique characteristics of a person, such as their values, beliefs, personality, and experiences. Situational factors, on the other hand, are features of the person's environment or the particular issue at hand, such as the context, culture, and available information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Individual, Situational.",

This can be achieved by creating a supportive and inclusive environment that values employees' contributions and well-being.\n\nJob enrichment and job enlargement are two strategies that can be used to empower employees and enhance their job satisfaction. Job enrichment involves giving employees a larger scope for decision-making and problem-solving, allowing them to take ownership of their work and feel more engaged. Job enlargement involves giving employees a wider range of tasks to perform, allowing them to develop new skills and take on new challenges.\n\nWhile reinvigorating and revitalizing can refer to energizing or rejuvenating employees, they do not specifically address the issue of empowering employees through job enrichment or job enlargement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Rehumanizing.",
