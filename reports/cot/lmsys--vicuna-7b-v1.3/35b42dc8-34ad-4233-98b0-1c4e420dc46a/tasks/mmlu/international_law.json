            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIndividuals, or physical persons, do not enjoy the same level of international legal personality as States and international organizations. While States and international organizations have a recognized legal personality under international law, individuals do not. This means that individuals do not have the same rights and privileges under international law as States and international organizations.\n\nOne of the key differences between individuals and States/international organizations is that States and international organizations have the ability to bring claims before international courts, while individuals do not. This is because States and international organizations are considered to be the primary actors in the international legal system, and they have the capacity to bring claims before international courts on their own behalf.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts.",

            "model_answer": "The meaning of collective rights is (D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members.\n\nTo explain the reasoning step-by-step, let's first define what individual rights are. Individual rights are rights that belong to a specific person and are not transferable to others. Examples of individual rights include the right to freedom of speech, the right to own property, and the right to vote.\n\nNow, let's define what collective rights are. Collective rights are rights that belong to a group of people rather than to individual members of the group. Examples of collective rights include the right to form a trade union, the right to self-defense, and the right to practice a particular religion.\n\nThe key difference between individual rights and collective rights is that individual rights belong to a specific person, while collective rights belong to a group of people. However, collective rights also entail individual rights for the members of the group. This means that each member of the group has the right to exercise the collective right, and the group as a whole has the right to exercise the collective right as a unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' refers to the idea that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be interpreted in a way that is adaptable to changing circumstances and evolving societal norms. This principle is used by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) to ensure that the Convention remains relevant and effective in protecting human rights.\n\nTo determine which case best illustrates the 'living instrument principle', we need to examine the approach taken by the ECtHR in each of the given cases.\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978) - In this case, the ECtHR held that the right to free elections under Article 3 of the Convention was not absolute, but could be limited in times of national emergency. This decision was based on the premise that the Convention must be interpreted in light of the specific circumstances of the time.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009) - In this case, the ECtHR held that the blanket ban on female genital mutilation (FGM) was a proportionate interference with the right to private and family life under Article 8 of the Convention. This decision demonstrates the ECtHR's willingness to adapt the Convention to address emerging human rights issues, such as FGM.\n\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002) - In this case, the ECtHR held that the UK's anti-terrorism legislation, which allowed for the detention of individuals without charge for up to 28 days, was compatible with the Convention. This decision reflects the ECtHR's recognition of the need for states to take measures to protect public safety in times of crisis.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998) - In this case, the ECtHR held that the UK's failure to investigate allegations of torture by a Libyan national in the UK was a breach of the Convention. This decision demonstrates the ECtHR's commitment to protecting individuals from human rights violations, even in the absence of state responsibility.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the case that best illustrates the 'living instrument principle' used by the ECtHR is (B) A v UK (2009). This decision demonstrates the ECtHR's willingness to adapt the Convention to address emerging human rights issues, such as FGM.",

            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation suggests in respect of treaties that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation is a legal principle that holds that treaties, once ratified by a state, have the same legal effect as domestic laws. This means that treaties are considered to be part of the domestic legal system and are enforceable in the same way as domestic laws.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B).\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the status of an entity being recognized as a subject of international law, which means that it has rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor. This status is typically granted to States, but it can also be granted to international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World Trade Organization, and to certain non-State actors, such as international criminal tribunals or human rights treaty bodies.\n\nThe term \"international legal personality\" is often used to distinguish between legal and physical persons under international law. Legal persons are entities that have legal personality and can therefore enter into legal relationships and be held accountable under international law. In contrast, physical persons are individuals who do not have legal personality and cannot enter into legal relationships under international law.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer.",

The judgment introduced a new dimension with respect to the incorporation of UNSC resolutions, which is that they are not binding if they violate human rights.

Instead, the ICJ held that the accumulation of smaller instances of armed force did not amount to an armed attack.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The ICJ has never addressed this issue, which is correct because the question asks about the ICJ's position on the accumulation of smaller instances of armed force leading to an armed attack, and the ICJ has not directly addressed this issue in any of its cases.",
