            "model_answer": "(D) men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBrown and Harris (1978) conducted a study on depression and found that men were more likely to experience depression than women, particularly in response to stress. This finding supports the idea that conventional gender roles may contribute to the vulnerability of men to depression. Men are often socialized to suppress their emotions and not seek help for mental health issues, which can lead to a higher risk of depression.\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support - This finding is not supported by the study.\n\n(B) self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent - This finding is not supported by the study.\n\n(C) men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression - This finding is not supported by the study.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the options is not identified as a new form of community, we need to understand the different types of communities that exist.\n\nA community is a group of people who share common interests, values, or geographic location. There are many different types of communities, including ethnic communities, gay villages, sociological communities, and virtual communities.\n\nEthnic communities are formed by people who share a common cultural background, language, or heritage. Gay villages are communities of people who identify as LGBTQ+ and live in certain parts of large cities. Sociological communities are formed by people who share a particular interest or profession, such as academics or artists. Virtual communities exist online and are formed by people who share common interests or goals.\n\nBased on this understanding, option (C) is not identified as a new form of community. Sociological communities are not a new form of community, as they have existed for many years. They are simply a type of community that is formed by people who share a particular interest or profession.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(D) the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe embourgeoisement thesis, proposed by sociologist Daniel Bell in the 1960s, argues that the rise of the service sector and the growth of white-collar jobs have led to a blurring of class boundaries and the emergence of a new \"bourgeois\" class. This class is characterized by its ability to work in non-manual jobs that require a high degree of education and professional skills, but that do not necessarily involve owning capital.\n\nOption (D) is the correct answer because it reflects the idea that the traditional class structure has been fragmented and that there are no longer any distinct social classes. The rise of the service sector and the growth of white-collar jobs have led to a situation in which there is a greater overlap between different social classes, and it is no longer possible to define clear boundaries between them.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it suggests that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority, which is not consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it suggests that the affluent working class is adopting middle-class values and ways of life, which is not consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it suggests that white-collar occupations are being \"deskilled\" by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace, which is not consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis.",

            "model_answer": "The four ideal types of social action that Weber identified were as follows: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and affectual.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to understand the characteristics of each of these ideal types and compare them to the options given.\n\nInstrumentally-rational action is characterized by the goal of achieving a specific outcome, with a clear plan of action to achieve that outcome. Value-rational action is characterized by the goal of fulfilling a particular value or belief, with a plan of action that is based on that value or belief. Traditional action is characterized by following established customs and traditions, without necessarily having a clear goal or plan. Affectual action is characterized by the goal of expressing or experiencing emotions, with a plan of action that is based on that emotion.\n\n(A) affectual - This option does not accurately describe any of the ideal types of social action that Weber identified.\n\n(B) affective - This option is similar to affectual action, but it is not a perfect match. Affective action is characterized by the goal of expressing or experiencing emotions, but it is not necessarily focused on a specific outcome or plan of action.\n\n(C) effective - This option is similar to instrumentally-rational action, but it is not a perfect match. Effective action is characterized by the goal of achieving a specific outcome, but it is not necessarily based on a clear plan of action or a rational approach.\n\n(D) infected - This option is not a valid choice and does not accurately describe any of the ideal types of social action that Weber identified.",

This suggests that drug use is more widespread and not limited to a particular group of people.\n\nStatement (B) states that Ecstasy is the most commonly used recreational drug. This suggests that Ecstasy is the most popular drug among users, rather than being the only drug used.\n\nStatement (C) implies that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This suggests that there may be a difference in drug use patterns between genders.\n\nStatement (D) suggests that despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is rare. This suggests that drug use is not widespread and is not a common occurrence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the overall pattern of drug use in Britain is that drug use has increased and is more widespread, but is not confined to a specific subculture. Ecstasy is the most commonly used recreational drug, but other drugs may also be used. There may be differences in drug use patterns between genders. However, despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is rare.\n\nAnswer: (D) despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare.",

The study aimed to understand how changes in society, technology, and employment patterns may have affected the division of household labor between partners.\n\nBased on the available information, we can infer that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when:\n\n(D) they were unemployed or both partners worked full time\n\nThis is because when both partners work full-time, they may have more time and resources to share household chores. On the other hand, when one partner is unemployed, they may have more time to contribute to household tasks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

This means that feminist research should be conducted from the standpoint of women, rather than from the standpoint of men or from a neutral or objective perspective.\n\nThis perspective is important because it recognizes that women's experiences and perspectives are often neglected or ignored in traditional forms of scholarship.
