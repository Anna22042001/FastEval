            "model_answer": "To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider the kinetic and potential energies of the mass.\n\nFirst, we need to find the potential energy of the mass due to the spring. The potential energy of a mass-spring system is given by the formula:\n\nPE = (1/2)kx^2\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\nSince the spring is massless, the potential energy is zero.\n\nNext, we need to find the kinetic energy of the mass. The kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n\nSince the mass is initially at rest, its velocity is zero. However, it acquires some velocity as it is displaced from its equilibrium position. We can find the final velocity of the mass using the work-energy principle.\n\nThe work done by the spring on the mass is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of the mass. Therefore, we have:\n\nW = Fd = (1/2)kx\n\nwhere F is the force exerted by the spring on the mass and d is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\nSince the spring is massless, the force exerted by the spring on the mass is zero. Therefore, the work done by the spring is zero.\n\nWe can now use the equation:\n\nKE = W + KE\\_initial\n\nwhere KE\\_initial is the initial kinetic energy of the mass. Since the mass is initially at rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nKE = W\n\nSubstituting the value of W, we get:\n\nKE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object and v is its final velocity.\n\nWe can find the final velocity of the mass using the equation:\n\nv^2 = 2kx\n\nwhere k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\nv^2 = 2k(0.030 m)\n\nv^2 = 0.06 m^2/s^2\n\nv = sqrt(0.06 m^2/s^2) = 0.13 m/s\n\nTherefore, the final velocity of the mass is 0.13 m/s.\n\nThe total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. Therefore, we have:\n\nE = KE + PE\n\nSubstituting the values of KE and PE, we get:\n\nE = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2)kx^2\n\nE = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2)k(0.030 m)^2\n\nE = (1/2)mv^2 + (1/4)kx^2\n\nE = (1/4)mv^2 + (1/2)kx^2\n\nE = (1/4)mv^2 + (1/2)(0.06 m^2/s^2)(0.030 m)\n\nE = (1/4)mv^2 + (1/2)0.018 m^2/s^2\n\nE = (1/4)mv^2 + 0.009 mJ\n\nE = 0.009 mJ\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 0.75 mJ.",

When white light is incident on the puddle, some of the light is reflected back into the puddle due to total internal reflection. The angle of incidence at which total internal reflection occurs is given by the critical angle, which is given by:\n\n\u03b8c = sin\u207b\u00b9(n\u00b2sin(\u03b8i))\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of the oil, \u03b8i is the angle of incidence, and sin\u207b\u00b9 is the inverse sine function.\n\nSince the oil has a higher refractive index than the water, the critical angle is smaller for the oil-water interface than for the water-air interface. Therefore, the light that is incident on the oil layer at an angle greater than the critical angle will be totally reflected back into the water.\n\nThe wavelength of light that is most strongly reflected can be determined by considering the thickness of the oil layer.

The resonant frequency of a pipe is inversely proportional to the square root of its temperature in degrees Celsius. This means that as the temperature of the pipe decreases, the resonant frequency increases.\n\nWe are given that the pipe resonates at a frequency of 440 Hz at 20\u00b0C. We need to find the frequency at which the pipe resonates on a particularly cold day when the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C.\n\nTo find the resonant frequency on a particularly cold day, we need to use the formula:\n\nf = (\u221a(k/m)) x (\u221a(2g/h))\n\nwhere f is the resonant frequency, k is the spring constant of the pipe, m is the mass of the pipe, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height of the pipe.\n\nWe are given that the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C, which means that the temperature of the pipe is 20\u00b0C minus 3% of 20\u00b0C, or 18\u00b0C. We can use this value to calculate the resonant frequency on a particularly cold day.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the spring constant of the pipe.

We are given that the pipe is made of water, which has a density of 1000 kg/m^3. The volume of the pipe is given by the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0 x r^2 x h\n\nwhere r is the radius of the pipe and h is the height of the pipe. We are given that the radius of the pipe is 0.5 meters, so the volume of the pipe is:\n\nV = \u03c0 x (0.5)^2 x 1 meter = 0.25 meters^3\n\nThe spring constant of the pipe is:\n\nk = (1/2) x 0.7854 meters^2 x 3.04 meters = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
