How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The angular separation of two stars refers to the angle between their lines of sight as seen from Earth. If the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes, then the stars will appear to be touching or very close to each other. This is because the human eye has a limited ability to distinguish small angles, and when the angular separation is small, the two stars will appear to be part of the same object rather than separate objects. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) the two stars will appear to be touching, looking rather like a small dumbbell.",

            "model_answer": "The Earth has the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds because it has a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. A partially molten metallic core: The Earth's core is composed mostly of iron and nickel, which are good conductors of electricity. This allows the core to generate and maintain a strong magnetic field.\n2. Reasonably rapid rotation: The faster the rotation of a planet, the stronger its magnetic field. The Earth's rotation is faster than any other terrestrial world, which contributes to its strong magnetic field.\n\nNow that we have explained our reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(C) It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) is the correct answer. The protoplanetary disk was spinning faster, causing centrifugal forces to fling the lighter materials towards the outer parts of the solar nebula. This caused the inner planets to be made of denser materials than the outer planets.\n\nExplanation: The protoplanetary disk was a disk of gas and dust that surrounded the newly formed Sun. As the disk spun faster, centrifugal forces caused the lighter materials to be flung towards the outer parts of the disk. This caused the denser materials, such as metals and rocks, to settle towards the center of the disk, where they eventually formed the inner planets.\n\n(B) is incorrect because it suggests that only metals and rocks were able to condense in the inner part of the nebula, while hydrogen compounds were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions. This is not supported by current scientific understanding.\n\n(C) is incorrect because it suggests that the denser materials settled towards the center of the nebula due to gravity, rather than centrifugal forces.\n\n(D) is incorrect because it suggests that the segregation of materials was due to a natural process that occurred in our particular solar system, rather than a general process that occurs in all protoplanetary disks.",
