            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing sweating. Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. When the body is exposed to a higher environmental temperature, it senses this increase and responds by increasing its metabolic rate to dissipate the excess heat.\n2. One of the ways the body dissipates heat is by increasing sweating. Sweating is the process of excreting water and salts through the skin's sweat glands.\n3. The increased sweating helps to cool the body by evaporating the sweat, which then carries heat away from the body's surface.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) increasing water lost through sweating.",

            "model_answer": "The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is (C) excretion via the kidneys.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLactate is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, which occurs when the body does not have enough oxygen to produce energy through aerobic metabolism. When muscle cells produce lactate, it is released into the bloodstream and transported to other tissues, where it can be used as a source of energy.\n\nHowever, the kidneys play a crucial role in regulating the levels of lactate in the blood. When lactate levels become too high, the kidneys reabsorb it and excrete it out of the body. This process is known as lactate clearance.\n\nTherefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is excretion via the kidneys.",

DNA is the genetic material that contains the instructions for the development and function of all living organisms.\n2. The genetic information in DNA is used to create RNA molecules, which act as messengers to carry instructions from the DNA to the ribosomes.\n3. The process of creating RNA molecules from DNA is called transcription.\n4. Transcription occurs in the nucleus of the cell, where the DNA is located.\n5.

            "model_answer": "The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded molecule of DNA is determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn a double-stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is determined by the base sequence in RNA. The four nitrogenous bases found in DNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). In RNA, the base uracil (U) replaces thymine. The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a DNA molecule is approximately 1:1, but in RNA, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is approximately 2:1. This is because RNA uses uracil instead of thymine, which is more easily cleaved by cellular enzymes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) genetically determined.",

            "model_answer": "The student's process is best characterized as (D) Elaborative rehearsal.\n\nExplanation:\n\nElaborative rehearsal is a type of memory retrieval strategy that involves actively engaging with previously learned information and building on it to create new connections and understanding. This is consistent with the student's active relating of basic information to previous knowledge and building on that knowledge to learn advanced concepts.\n\nChunking involves grouping related information into larger chunks to make it easier to remember. This is not necessarily the best characterization of the student's process, as it does not involve actively engaging with and building on previously learned information.\n\nA network model involves creating a mental model of the information being learned, with nodes and connections representing different concepts and their relationships.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which molecule will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, we need to understand the role of each molecule in the cellular respiration process and how oxygen is involved in this process.\n\nCellular respiration is the process by which cells produce energy from organic compounds, such as glucose. It involves a series of reactions that occur in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The overall goal of cellular respiration is to produce carbon dioxide and water, which are released from the cell as waste products.\n\nOxygen is an essential component of cellular respiration, as it is required for the final step of the process, which is oxidative phosphorylation. In this step, the energy stored in the bonds of glucose is released, and oxygen is used to generate ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell.\n\nNow, let's look at the molecules listed in the question:\n\n(A) Oxaloacetate: Oxaloacetate is a molecule that is involved in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is an intermediate in the breakdown of glucose and is converted into other molecules, such as succinyl-CoA and fumarate, which are further metabolized.\n\n(B) Pyruvate: Pyruvate is an end product of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. It is produced when glucose is broken down into acetyl-CoA, which is then converted into pyruvate in the mitochondria. Pyruvate can be converted into other molecules, such as acetyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle.\n\n(C) Water: Water is not directly involved in cellular respiration. It is produced as a byproduct of the reactions that occur in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n(D) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP): ATP is a molecule that stores and transports energy within the cell. It is produced in the mitochondria during the electron transport chain, which is the final step of oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nBased on the above information, it is clear that oxygen is essential for the production of ATP, which is the final product of cellular respiration. Therefore, when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, ATP production will stop first.\n\nThe answer is (D) Adenosine triphosphate.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is that as the game progresses, the players become more fatigued and their muscles require more energy to maintain their performance. This increased demand for energy leads to an increase in blood lactate concentration. The blood lactate concentration can be measured at different points in the game, such as at the beginning, middle, and end of the game. Therefore, it is possible that the blood lactate concentration will be higher at the end of the game than at the beginning, as the players have become more fatigued over time. However, it is also possible that the blood lactate concentration will remain relatively stable throughout the game, or that it will decrease towards the end of the game as the players become more fatigued.

It is broken down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and energy during exercise. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound found in muscle cells that can be used to replenish ATP stores during exercise.\n\nThe amount of time that maximal exertion exercise can be sustained depends on the individual's fitness level and the intensity and duration of the exercise.
