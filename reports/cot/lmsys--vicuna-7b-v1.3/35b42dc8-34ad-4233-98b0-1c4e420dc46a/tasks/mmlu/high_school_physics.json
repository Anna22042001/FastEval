            "model_answer": "To determine which statements are true, we need to consider the motion of the whiffle ball under the influence of air resistance.\n\nFirst, we know that the ball's initial upward motion is due to its initial velocity, which is given by the force of the toss. As the ball rises, air resistance acts in the opposite direction, slowing down its upward motion. At some point, the force of air resistance becomes equal in magnitude to the force of gravity, and the ball reaches its highest point. At this point, the ball's velocity is zero, but its acceleration is not necessarily zero.\n\nNext, as the ball falls back down, air resistance continues to act in the opposite direction, slowing down its motion. However, since the ball's initial velocity was non-zero, its acceleration is not zero during this fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) I & III only. The ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point, and it takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the magnetic field strength and the radius of curvature of a circular path. The magnetic field strength of the Earth is given as 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T, and we want to find the radius of the circle that the electron beam will form when it is deflected by this magnetic field.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the magnetic field strength from Tesla to newtons per meter. One Tesla is equal to 10,000 gauss, and 1 gauss is equal to 10,000 nanoTesla. Therefore, the magnetic field strength of the Earth is equal to 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T = 500 gauss.\n\nNext, we need to consider the Lorentz force, which is the force exerted on a charged particle by a magnetic field. The Lorentz force is given by the equation F = qv \u00d7 B, where q is the charge of the particle, v is its velocity, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nTo find the radius of the circle, we need to consider the direction of the Lorentz force on the electron. Since the electron is moving in a circular path, the Lorentz force must be perpendicular to the electron's velocity vector. Therefore, the Lorentz force will cause the electron to change its direction of motion, causing it to move in a straight line.\n\nThe radius of the circle can be found by considering the distance that the electron travels in a small time interval, such as one second. The distance traveled by the electron is given by the equation d = vt, where v is the velocity of the electron and t is the time interval.\n\nSince the electron is moving in a circular path, its velocity vector is perpendicular to its direction of motion. Therefore, the distance traveled by the electron in a small time interval is given by the equation d = r \u00d7 vt, where r is the radius of the circle.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the radius of the circle: r = d / (vt \u00d7 cos(\u03b8)), where \u03b8 is the angle between the electron's velocity vector and the direction of motion.\n\nSince the electron is moving in a circular path with a radius of R, its velocity vector is given by the equation v = R \u00d7 \u03c9, where \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the electron. Therefore, the angle between the electron's velocity vector and the direction of motion is given by the equation \u03b8 = atan(vx / vy), where vx and vy are the x and y components of the electron's velocity vector.\n\nWe can substitute these expressions into the equation for the radius of the circle to find the radius:\n\nr = d / (vt \u00d7 cos(\u03b8))\n= R \u00d7 \u03c9 \u00d7 d / (R \u00d7 \u03c9 \u00d7 cos(atan(vx / vy)))\n\nSince the electron is moving at a speed of 10^7 m/s, we can substitute this value into the equation for d to find the radius:\n\nr = R \u00d7 \u03c9 \u00d7 10^7 m/s / (R \u00d7 \u03c9 \u00d7 cos(atan(vx / vy)))\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the factor R \u00d7 \u03c9:\n\nr = 10^7 m/s / (cos(atan(vx / vy)))\n\nWe can now solve for the radius by substituting the values for vx and vy:\n\nr = 10^7 m/s / (cos(atan(10^7 m/s / 10^7 m/s)))\n= 10^7 m/s / 1\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle will be 1 nm.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) 1 nm.",

Since the charge is measured in coulombs (C), we know that it is a large value and cannot be represented by a single digit after the decimal point. Therefore, options (A), (B), (C), and (D) are all possible values for the charge on the oil drop.\n\nNext, let's consider the range of possible measurements that could be obtained in the laboratory. The laboratory may use a variety of instruments to measure the charge on the oil drop, such as a voltmeter or an ammeter. The resolution of these instruments determines the smallest change in the measured value that can be detected. For example, a voltmeter with a resolution of 1 mV may be able to detect changes in voltage as small as 1 mV, while an ammeter with a resolution of 1 A may be able to detect changes in current as small as 1 A.\n\nBased on this information, we can reject options (A) and (B) as highly unlikely to be correct. These values are too small to be detected by the instruments used in the laboratory, given their resolution.\n\nOption (C) is also unlikely to be correct because it is too large compared to the range of possible measurements that could be obtained in the laboratory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 2.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C.

This force is equal to the weight of the water that the object displaces.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the volume of water displaced by the object\nThe volume of a cylinder is given by V = \u03c0r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.

The voltage is equal to the charge on each plate divided by the capacitance. Since there are 6 \u03bcC of charge on each plate, the voltage across the capacitor is 6 \u03bcC / 30 \u03bcF = 0.2 V.\n\nNext, we can use the formula to find the energy stored in the capacitor: E = 0.5 \\* 30 \u03bcF \\* 0.2^2 = 0.5 \\* 30 \u03bcF \\* 0.04 = 3 \\* 10^-6 J.\n\nTherefore, the energy stored in the capacitor is (D) 12.5 J.",

The acceleration of an object is the rate of change of its velocity. The relationship between these two quantities can be described by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration.\n\nTo construct the graph, we plot the net force on the vertical axis and the acceleration on the horizontal axis. The slope of the graph represents the acceleration caused by a given net force.\n\nTherefore, the quantity directly measured using the slope of the graph is the acceleration.\n\nThe answer is (D) Inertial mass.",
