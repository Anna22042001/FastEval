            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which country is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the natural resources that each country has and how much they rely on importing those resources.\n\nThe United States has a diverse range of natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, timber, and minerals. However, the country is also a major importer of some of these resources, particularly oil and natural gas.\n\nJapan has limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and metals.\n\nFrance has a variety of natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and metals, but it also relies heavily on imports of these resources.\n\nThe United Kingdom has a range of natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and metals, but it also relies heavily on imports of these resources.\n\nBased on this information, it appears that Japan is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, as it relies heavily on imports of all of the natural resources listed. Therefore, the answer is (B) Japan.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) innovative diffusion.\n\nThe reason for this is that when a new fashion design is introduced globally, it typically spreads through a process of innovation, where the new design is introduced to a small group of people or a specific market, and then it spreads to other markets or groups through imitation or adoption. This process is different from the other options, which describe different types of diffusion processes.\n\nContagious diffusion (A) occurs when a new idea or behavior spreads rapidly through a population, often through face-to-face interactions. Relocation diffusion (B) occurs when people or resources are moved from one location to another, and the new location may adopt the new idea or behavior. Hierarchical diffusion (D) occurs when a new idea or behavior is introduced to a central authority or organization, which then spreads it to other parts of the organization or society.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) innovative diffusion.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, we need to understand the key concepts and principles of his theory. Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation posits that the unequal distribution of wealth and power between developed and developing regions leads to a self-reinforcing cycle of economic and political domination by the core countries over the periphery.\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions sharing similarly in wealth through trade is a key principle of Myrdal's theory. This principle suggests that trade can help reduce the wealth gap between developed and developing regions by increasing the flow of goods, services, and capital between them.\n\n(B) The core dominating the periphery is also a key principle of Myrdal's theory. According to Myrdal, the core countries have greater economic and political power than the periphery countries, which allows them to dominate the global economic and political systems.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core existing at the expense of the periphery is a central tenet of Myrdal's theory. Myrdal argued that the core countries exploit the periphery countries by extracting resources and labor at low cost, which contributes to the accumulation of wealth and power by the core.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade is not part of Myrdal's theory. While Myrdal acknowledged the role of initial advantages in shaping the distribution of wealth and power between developed and developing regions, he did not argue that regions with initial advantages always maintain or expand their advantages through trade and other means.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is (D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade. The other three statements are key principles of Myrdal's theory.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The concentration of production activities and people spatially is called (C) agglomeration.\n\nExplanation:\nAgglomeration refers to the clustering of economic activities and population in a particular area. This clustering can lead to economies of scale, increased specialization, and better access to resources and markets. Agglomeration can benefit everyone by increasing productivity, reducing costs, and improving access to goods and services.\n\n(A) The substitution principle refers to the idea of substituting one good or service for another in order to save money or improve efficiency.\n\n(B) Deglomeration refers to the dispersal or decentralization of economic activities and population.\n\n(D) Infrastructure refers to the physical and organizational structures that support the functioning of a society, such as roads, bridges, and utilities. While infrastructure can facilitate agglomeration by providing access to resources and markets, it is not the same as agglomeration itself.",
