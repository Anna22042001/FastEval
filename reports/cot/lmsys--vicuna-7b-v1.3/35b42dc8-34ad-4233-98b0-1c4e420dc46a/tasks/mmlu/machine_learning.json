            "model_answer": "The structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network is (A) the number of hidden nodes.\n\nThe reason for this is that the number of hidden nodes directly affects the capacity of the model, which is a measure of how well the model can fit the training data. A model with more hidden nodes can fit the training data better, but it also has a higher risk of overfitting, as it can fit the noise in the training data as well. On the other hand, a model with fewer hidden nodes has a lower capacity and is more likely to underfit the training data, but it also has a lower risk of overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the choice of the number of hidden nodes is a critical trade-off in neural network design, and it affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting more than the other options listed.",

While CPUs are still used for smaller models or during the early stages of training, GPUs are more commonly used for training large models due to their parallel processing capabilities.

It has a large number of parameters, which makes it computationally expensive to train. However, the exact number of parameters is not publicly available, and estimates vary depending on the specific implementation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the truth value of statement 2 definitively.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (A) True, True.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the effect of adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to a linear regression model.\n\nWhen we add $\\ell_2$ regularization, we introduce a penalty term to the objective function that we minimize during training. This penalty term is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights, multiplied by a regularization coefficient.\n\nThe regularization coefficient controls the strength of the penalty term. As we increase the regularization coefficient, the penalty term becomes more important in the objective function, and the model is encouraged to use smaller, less important weights.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of the regularization coefficient on the bias and variance of the model.\n\nThe bias of the model is the error that is introduced by the model's assumptions. In this case, the bias is related to the model's parameters, specifically the weights. As we increase the regularization coefficient, the model is encouraged to use smaller weights, which means that the model is assuming that the relationship between the input and output is weaker. This will result in a lower bias.\n\nThe variance of the model is the error that is introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. In other words, the variance is related to the model's complexity. As we increase the regularization coefficient, the model is encouraged to use simpler models with fewer parameters, which means that the model is less sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data. This will result in a lower variance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Bias decrease ; Variance increase.

In this transformed space, the 1-NN classifier using unweighted Euclidean distance may have better performance than in the original space due to the increased separation between classes. However, we cannot guarantee this improvement, as it depends on the specific data and the chosen kernel function.\n\nStatement 2: The VC dimension of a Perceptron is smaller than the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM.\n\nExplanation: The VC dimension measures the number of linearly independent data points required to distinguish between all possible classes. A Perceptron is a simple linear classifier that uses a single threshold function to classify data points. The VC dimension of a Perceptron is equal to the number of input features, while the VC dimension of a simple linear SVM is equal to the number of support vectors (the data points that are closest to the decision boundary).
