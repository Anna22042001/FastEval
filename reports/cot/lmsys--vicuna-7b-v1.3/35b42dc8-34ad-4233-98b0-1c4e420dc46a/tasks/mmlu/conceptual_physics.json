            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nTo explain the reasoning step-by-step, let's consider each of the options:\n\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\n\nThis statement is true according to the theory of general relativity. The Sun's gravity bends space-time around it, causing light to follow a curved path as it leaves the Sun. This results in a delay in the arrival time of the light at Earth, which is known as gravitational redshift.\n\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected.\n\nThis statement is also true according to the theory of general relativity. The Sun's gravity bends space-time around it, causing light to follow a curved path as it passes by the Sun. This results in a deflection of the light's path, which is known as gravitational lensing.\n\n(C) A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth.\n\nThis statement is false according to the theory of general relativity. In fact, the opposite is true. The theory predicts that a clock on the surface of the Sun would run slower than a clock on Earth due to the effects of gravity. This is known as gravitational time dilation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D), which is all of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the definition of a galvanometer and how it is used to measure electric current or voltage.\n\nA galvanometer is an electrical instrument used to measure electric current or voltage. It works by detecting the magnetic field produced by the flow of electric current. There are two main types of galvanometers: moving coil and moving iron.\n\nMoving coil galvanometers have a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field. When a current flows through the coil, it generates a magnetic field that causes the coil to move. The movement of the coil is proportional to the current flowing through it, and can be calibrated to read the current in amps or milliamps.\n\nMoving iron galvanometers have a core of iron that is suspended in a magnetic field. When a current flows through the iron, it generates a magnetic field that causes the iron to move. The movement of the iron is also proportional to the current flowing through it, and can be calibrated to read the current in amps or milliamps.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that a galvanometer can be calibrated to read either electric current or voltage, but not both at the same time. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Either of these.",

The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in its atomic nucleus.\n\nLet's consider the process of beta decay, which is the process by which a beta particle is ejected from an atomic nucleus. In beta decay, a neutron in the nucleus of an unstable atom decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. This means that the atomic number of the element decreases by one, and the mass number of the element decreases by the mass of the ejected electron.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) reduces by 1.",

In this reaction, the nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, such as helium-3, and release a large amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the neutron.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the alpha particle is released as it is emitted from the reaction site, and the kinetic energy of the neutron is released as it moves through the surrounding material.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The gravitational force on a satellite in a circular Earth orbit is not zero, but it is practically zero compared to the centripetal force required to maintain the satellite's circular motion. This is because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the satellite and the Earth. As the satellite moves in a circular path around the Earth, the gravitational force acting on it varies inversely with the square of the distance from the Earth. This means that the gravitational force is very small at the distance of the satellite's orbit, and it becomes even smaller as the satellite moves further away from the Earth.\n\nThe centripetal force required to maintain the satellite's circular motion, on the other hand, is directly proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the circular path. This means that the centripetal force is much larger than the gravitational force at the distance of the satellite's orbit. As a result, the satellite maintains a constant speed in its circular orbit, even though the gravitational force on it is practically zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) practically zero.",
