            "model_answer": "Next generation sequencing (NGS) is most often used to identify quasi species viruses.\n\nExplanation:\nNGS is a powerful tool that allows for the rapid and efficient sequencing of large amounts of DNA or RNA. It has revolutionized the field of virology and has become an essential tool for the study of viruses.\n\nOne of the main applications of NGS is the identification of quasi species viruses. Quasi species viruses are viruses that are genetically similar but have differences in their surface proteins, which can lead to antigenic drift and the emergence of new strains. NGS can be used to sequence the entire genome of a virus and compare it to known sequences in order to identify quasi species viruses.\n\nWhile NGS can also be used to identify drug resistant mutants, this is not its primary use. Similarly, NGS cannot be used to identify newly discovered viruses, as this would require a different approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) To identify quasi species viruses.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for effect modification (interaction).\n\nExplanation:\nRandomization helps to minimize the potential biases that may arise due to differences between the study groups. One of the key biases that randomization can help to control for is effect modification (interaction), which occurs when the effect of the treatment varies depending on the characteristics of the individual being studied. For example, a treatment may be more effective in individuals with a certain genetic background or medical history. Randomization ensures that each group is composed of individuals with similar characteristics, thus reducing the likelihood of effect modification.\n\nA) Placebo effect: Randomization does not directly control for the placebo effect, but it can help to minimize its impact by ensuring that each group has an equal chance of receiving the placebo.\n\nB) Recall bias: Randomization can help to control for recall bias by ensuring that each group has an equal chance of being selected for the study.\n\nC) Non-compliance: Randomization can help to control for non-compliance by ensuring that each group has an equal chance of being selected for the study and receiving the treatment.\n\nD) Effect modification (interaction): Randomization is most helpful for controlling for effect modification (interaction), as it ensures that each group is composed of individuals with similar characteristics, thus reducing the likelihood of effect modification.",

            "model_answer": "The papilloma family of viruses, including human papillomavirus (HPV), is known to cause cancer by a combination of mechanisms. The answer is (A).\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. HPV is a DNA virus that replicates in dividing cells, such as epithelial cells in the skin and mucous membranes.\n2. HPV encodes three oncogenic proteins, E5, E6, and E7, which are involved in the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells.\n3. E5 and E6 proteins target and destroy the tumor suppressor protein p53, which normally helps to prevent the development of cancer by controlling cell growth and DNA repair.\n4. E7 protein inhibits the function of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), another tumor suppressor protein, which also plays a role in preventing the development of cancer by controlling cell growth and DNA repair.\n5. The loss of p53 and Rb function allows the HPV-infected cells to continue to grow and divide uncontrollably, leading to the development of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the papilloma family of viruses causes cancer by replicating in dividing cells, encoding oncogenic proteins that target and destroy tumor suppressor proteins, and allowing the HPV-infected cells to continue to grow and divide uncontrollably.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D).\n\nThe modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo. This is a special feature of the rabies vaccine because it is one of the few vaccines that are grown in cell culture rather than being produced using the original virus or bacteria. This allows for the production of large quantities of vaccine at a lower cost and with a more consistent quality than traditional methods. Additionally, it eliminates the need for the use of live viruses or bacteria in the production process, which reduces the risk of contamination and the potential for the vaccine to revert to its original form.",

One of the key features of adaptive immunity is the ability to distinguish between self and non-self. This is important because the immune system needs to be able to distinguish between the body's own cells and foreign cells in order to avoid attacking the body's own cells.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the speed of response to a foreign protein is a characteristic of innate immunity, not adaptive immunity.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the ability to distinguish between viruses and bacteria is a characteristic of innate immunity, not adaptive immunity.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the ability to develop memory is a characteristic of adaptive immunity, not innate immunity.",

Vaccines: Vaccines work by introducing a small, harmless piece of a virus or bacteria to the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies to fight the disease. This can prevent the person from getting the disease if they are exposed to it.\n2. Antivirals: Antivirals are medications that can be taken to treat viral infections. They work by targeting specific viral proteins and preventing the virus from replicating. However, they cannot prevent the spread of the virus if someone is already infected.\n3. Hygiene: Good hygiene practices such as washing hands regularly, cooking food thoroughly, and avoiding close contact with sick people can help prevent the spread of many diseases.\n4. Mosquito nets: Mosquito nets can help prevent the spread of diseases such as malaria, which are spread by mosquitoes.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent diseases.

They collect data from 100 cases (patients with lung cancer) and 100 controls (people without lung cancer) and find that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.5).\n\nHowever, the researchers then divide the study subjects into two groups: smokers and non-smokers. This is an example of confounding, which occurs when an observed association between two variables is due to the presence of a third variable that affects both variables. In this case, the third variable is smoking status, which is related to both alcohol consumption and lung cancer.\n\nTo test whether the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer is due to confounding, the researchers need to control for smoking status. If they find that the association remains strong even after controlling for smoking status, then confounding is unlikely to be the explanation for the observed association. However, if the association disappears after controlling for smoking status, then confounding is likely to be the explanation.\n\nTherefore, the scenario described is an example of confounding, which is a common problem in observational studies where the exposure and outcome variables are related to each other through a third variable.",
