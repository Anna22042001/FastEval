So if the convertible is older than the station wagon, the station wagon should be in a place closer to the hatchback than the convertible, not in the same position as the truck.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because a minivan is typically older than a convertible. The convertible is a two-seater cabriolet, while a minivan is a multi-passenger vehicle with folding seats and front and rear doors.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the bus is the oldest, not the third-oldest. We can eliminate this option based on the two-seater cabriolet design of the convertible being older than the station wagon, and the structure of a car show that typically places the oldest vehicles at the end.\n\nTherefore, the only option left is (A) The truck is the third-oldest. We can reason that the bus is the oldest, followed by the tractor (or convertible), the station wagon, the hatchback, the truck, the minivan, and then the convertible.
