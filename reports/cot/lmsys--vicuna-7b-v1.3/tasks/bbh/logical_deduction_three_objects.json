Here's how we can approach it step-by-step:\n\n1. We are told that there are three objects arranged in a fixed order on a shelf, and that the blue book is the rightmost. This means that if we look at the shelf, we will first see the blue book, followed by the orange book, and finally the red book.\n2. We are also told that the orange book is the leftmost. However, this information alone doesn't help us determine the position of the red book relative to the other two objects.\n3. To determine the position of the red book relative to the other two books, we need to use the information about the relative positions of the blue and orange books. Since the blue book is the rightmost, and the orange book is to the left of the blue book, we can conclude that the red book must be to the right of the orange book.\n4. Now, we need to determine whether the red book is the second from the left, the second from the right, or somewhere in between. We can use the fact that the blue book is the rightmost, and the orange book is to its left. This means that there is a straight line from the left edge of the shelf to the orange book, and a straight line from the right edge of the shelf to the blue book. Since there are two straight lines, we know that there must be some object (in this case, the red book) that is not on the left or right edge of the shelf. This means that it must be in the middle, and therefore the second from the left would not be correct.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the red book is not the second from the left, and neither is it the second from the right. This means that",
