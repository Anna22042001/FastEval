From the number of days calculated in step 2, find the number of days remaining until the end of the calendar year, assuming the start and end dates are within the same year.\n4. Determine the leap year counting that brings us from the start of July (July 1, 1972) to the second Tuesday of July (July 8, 1972), considering leap years occur every 4 years (except for year 0).\n5. Compute the calendar day of the week for July 8, 1972, considering that we have already factored in the number of days from July 1 to July 8.\n\nNow, let's join all the steps:\n\n1. Calculation: July 8, 1972, is a Tuesday, and it is the second Tuesday of the month. So, we have confirmed that tomorrow is July 9, 1972 (Tue).\n2. Counting: From June 23 to July 8, there are ",

However, since there are only 12 months in a year (not 13), we need to add one to the result to get 356 days.\n\nTo convert these days into the format MM/DD/YYYY, we need to count the number of full months (1 to 12) and add a leading zero if necessary. In this case, we have 1 month (August) and 29 days, so we need to add a leading zero to the month (08) and a leading zero to the day (02).\n\nThus, the date 10 days ago from Sep 9, 1909 is:\n\n(C) 08/30/1909",

To do this, we can use the fact that the current date is in the format of MM/DD/YYYY, and that we have 31 days in February except for a leap year, which has 29 days in February.\n\nWe can start by finding the number of days that have elapsed from January 1, 2003 to April 5, 2004. The difference between January 1, 2003 and April 5, 2004 is 366 days (365 days in a year plus the leap year). We need to subtract this amount of days from the total number of days in a year to find the number of days that have elapsed from January 1, 2003 to April 5, 2003.\n\nIf we assume that there are 365 days in a year, we can divide the difference of 366 days by 365 to get 0.9933. We can round this down to 0.99 since it is close enough to 1. This means that we need to subtract 0.99 days from the total number of days in a year to find the number of days that have elapsed from January 1, 2003 to April 5, 2003.\n\nSince there are 7 days in a week, the number of days that we need to subtract is 0.99 days / 7 = 0.1414 days. Since we cannot have fraction of a day, we subtract 0.14 days instead. This is because 7 - 0.14 = 6.86",
