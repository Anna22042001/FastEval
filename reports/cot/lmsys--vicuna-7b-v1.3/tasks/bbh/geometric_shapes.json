This path changes direction twice, indicating that it is a more complex shape than just a straight line or a rectangle.\n1. Also, these two lines are partially overlapping and do not form a straight line.\n2. The third and fourth line commands \"L 51.86,58.44\" \"M 51.86,58.44 L 52.09,49.14\" describes a straight line connecting two points, which also indicates the path is not a rectangle.\n3.
