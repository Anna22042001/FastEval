It is a positive statement about a charitable person and charity event. Therefore, option (A) is not sarcastic.\n\n(B) \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\" This statement is the opposite of (A) and uses words like \"terrible\" and \"to help kids in need\" which are negatively connoted. The sarcastic effect is achieved by the contrast between the positive statement in (A) and the negative statement in (B). Therefore, option (B) is sarcastic.\n\nIn conclusion, the sarcastic statement is (B): \"He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\"",

If someone is genuinely happy, it is unlikely that they would be depressed. So, this statement is most likely not sarcastic.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nOption B:\nIn this option, the word \"just\" has been added to the original sentence, which changes the meaning. The original sentence is usually sarcastic, and the addition of \"just\" might change the tone or connotation, making it less sarcastic.\n\nIn order to determine if the sentence is still sarcastic with the added word \"just,\" we must consider the context surrounding the statement. If the person is sarcastically suggesting that being happy would immediately make another person not depressed, and \"just\" is used in a sarcastic manner, then the sentence could still be sarcastic even with the addition of \"just.\" However, if the person genuinely believes that being happy would help with depression, and \"just\" is used to politely suggest the same, then this statement is likely not sarcastic.\n\nAnswer: B",

This statement might be sarcastic if the speaker disagrees with the idea of the person doing nothing during an assault and believes that retaliation could be the appropriate response.
