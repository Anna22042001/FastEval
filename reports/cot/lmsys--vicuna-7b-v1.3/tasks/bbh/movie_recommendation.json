The movie has a medical background, similar to Jurassic Park, but unlike the other options. While it shares some themes with Forrest Gump, it is not similar to Beauty and the Beast or Independence Day.\n\n(D) Kicking Off:\nKicking Off is an action movie with some fantasy elements. However, unlike the other options, it does not share any notable thematic, narrative, or visual connections with Beauty and the Beast, Independence Day, Forrest Gump, or Jurassic Park.\n\nAnswer: (A) The Bag Man",
