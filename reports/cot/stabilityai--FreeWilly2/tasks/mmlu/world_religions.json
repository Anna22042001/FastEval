            "question": " What can murtis be translated as?\n\n(A) Offerings\n(B) Prayers\n(C) Apparitions\n(D) Idols",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To translate the word \"murtis\" into its English equivalent, we need to know the proper context or origin of the term. Here, we can translate from Sanskrit or Hindi since both languages use the term \"murtis.\" \n\nIn Sanskrit, \"murti\" (\u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f) means \"image\" or \"form.\" It is a common term used in the context of sculptures, idols, or figures, particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing deities or other religious figures. \n\nNow, let's examine the given options one by one:\n\n(A) Offerings - Although \"murtis\" are related to religious practices like worship and offerings, they do not translate directly to offerings in English.\n\n(B) Prayers - \"Prayers\" are requests or expressions of devotion made to deities, but \"murtis\" do not directly translate to that.\n\n(C) Apparitions - \"Apparitions\" are unusual or unexpected appearances, but \"murtis\" don't have that meaning in the context of the given options.\n\n(D) Idols - In both Hinduism and Buddhism, \"murtis\" can be used to refer to idols or figures representing deities and other religious figures. However, \"idols\" can be considered primarily synonymous with physical, tangible representations of these entities.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) Idols",

            "question": " Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with which of the following?\n\n(A) Daoism\n(B) Yin-Yang School\n(C) Mengzi\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question. We need to find out which of the given options, (A) Daoism, (B) Yin-Yang School, (C) Mengzi, and (D) Humanistic Buddhism, is associated with naturalists who focused on natural elements and processes.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options. We will review each option to understand which one is related to naturalists and natural elements and processes. This will help us decide which one is the correct answer.\n\n(A) Daoism: Daoism, also known as Taoism, originated in China and is an ancient philosophical and religious tradition. It focuses on harmony with nature and encourages living in a balanced way, following the Dao or Tao. Naturalists who study natural elements and processes might encounter aspects of Daoism in their research.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: The Yin-Yang School is an aspect of Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the balance and interdependence of the opposites, such as the yin and the yang. Their observations of natural elements and processes might lead to some discoveries supporting such theories.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mencius, also known as Mengzi, was a Chinese philosopher and thinker who is considered an important figure in Confucianism. While his teachings focused on the human mind, human nature, and morality, tying it directly to naturalists who studied natural elements and processes may be a stretch.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism: Humanistic Buddhism is a branch of Buddhism that emphasizes interpersonal relationships and personal cultivation. It does not necessarily focus on natural elements and processes.\n\nStep 3: Select the best match. Based on the analysis, option (A) Daoism and (B) Yin-Yang School have both shown a connection with naturalists who studied natural elements and processes. However, (A) Daoism has more direct connections with the natural world, whereas (B) Yin-Yang School is focused more on balance and interdependence. Therefore, our answer is most likely (A).\n\nStep 4: Output the answer as a single letter in parenthesis. \n\n(A)",
