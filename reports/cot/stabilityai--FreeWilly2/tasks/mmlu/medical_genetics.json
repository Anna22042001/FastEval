We can eliminate options (B) centromeres and (C) histones because these refer to the structures and proteins involved in packaging DNA, not the location of the fusion.\n\nComparing (A) telomeres and (D) ends of the long arms, telomeres are non-coding DNA sequences that are repetitive in nature and occur only at the tips of chromosomes. Ends of the long arms refer to the actual physical ends of the chromosomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) ends of the long arms.",

            "model_answer": "Let's use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to determine the expected frequency of affected females in an X-linked recessive condition.\n\nStep 1: Determine the frequency of carrier females (q).\nSince the frequency of males affected is 0.10, the frequency of carriers would be 0.10 in females. We know that the frequency of the rare allele in a population (q) is equal to the square of the carrier frequency.\n\nq = sqrt[0.10] = 0.32\n\nStep 2: Calculate the frequency of unaffected females (p).\nIn a population at equilibrium, the frequency of unaffected females (p) can be determined by using the fact that the sum of the squared frequencies of the two alleles equals 1. We have one value which is q^2 = 0.10, so we can calculate p as follows:\n\np^2 + q^2 = 1\n1 - 0.10 = p^2\n0.90 = p^2\np = sqrt(0.90) = 0.95\n\nStep 3: Calculate the expected frequency of affected females (f).\nSince females inherit two X chromosomes, there are four possible genotypes for females: AA, Aa, and aa. The expected frequency of affected females would be the frequency of the double recessive trait (aa) multiplied by the probability of inheriting an \"a\" allele from both parents.\n\nf = q^2 * (1 - p)\nf = 0.32^2 * 0.05\nf = 0.016\n\nAnswer: (A) 0.01",

            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia, we will analyze the given options.\n\n(A) Autosomal dominant: This means that a single copy of the mutated gene from either parent can cause the condition. However, we don't have any information about the occurrence of malignant hyperthermia in relatives or whether one copy of the gene can cause the condition. \n\n(B) Autosomal recessive: This means that two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, are required to cause the condition. As we don't know about the disease's prevalence in relatives or how many copies of the gene could cause the condition, we can't rule out this possibility.\n\n(C) X-linked dominant: This means that if one parent passes on the mutated gene on the X chromosome, the child will inherit the condition. However, malignant hyperthermia doesn't appear to be specific to either gender, ruling out this possibility.\n\n(D) X-linked recessive: This means that two copies of the mutated gene on the X chromosome, one from each parent, are needed to cause the condition. This type of inheritance is seen more in males than females, as females can have a milder clinical presentation if only one copy of the mutated gene is inherited. We can't rule out this possibility, but we lack information regarding the gender-specific occurrence of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nBased on the information given, none of the above patterns of inheritance can be definitively concluded. But considering the fewer assumptions and the fact that no specific pattern is apparent in the other options, (B) autosomal recessive appears to be the most fitting option, as it doesn't rely on specific inheritance assumptions.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(B) autosomal recessive",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first analyze each option and see which one is associated with exon skipping.\n\n1. (A) Nonsense mutations: These mutations introduce premature stop codons or nonsense codons which cause the protein to be prematurely terminated. This can lead to truncated or non-functional proteins, but there is no direct connection between nonsense mutations and exon skipping. \n\n2. (B) Regulatory mutations: Regulatory mutations affect the regulation of gene expression and can play a role in controlling how genes are turned on or off. Although regulatory mutations may affect the exon skipping process, they are not directly associated with exon skipping.\n\n3. (C) RNA processing mutations: RNA processing refers to a series of steps that create the mature RNA from the precursor RNA transcript. Exon skipping occurs while pre-mRNA splicing, which is a part of the RNA processing steps. Therefore, there is a direct connection between exon skipping and RNA processing mutations. This option is likely the correct answer.\n\n4. (D) Silent mutations: Silent mutations do not affect the protein sequence or function, as they do not change the amino acid encoded by the codon. They are also not directly associated with exon skipping.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) RNA processing mutations.",
