This is done by choosing two different fruits and multiplying their probabilities. There are 3C2 (3 choose 2) ways to choose 2 fruits out of the 3 possible fruits (apple, orange, and banana). \n(3C2 = 3)\n\nNow, imagine the two different fruits Joe chooses uniquely in each meal:\n(apple, orange)\n(apple, banana)\n(orange, banana)\n\nFor each of these 3 combinations, you can calculate their probabilities by taking 2 fruits and multiplying their probabilities:\n(apple, orange) = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9\n(apple, banana) = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9\n(orange, banana) = (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThese three probabilities are independent of each other, so we can sum them up to find the total probability of Joe eating two different kinds of fruits:\n(1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9) = 3/9\n\nStep 3: Find the probability of Joe eating at least two different kinds of fruit in a day.\nNow, multiply the probability of Joe eating two different kinds of fruit (3/9) in a meal by the number of meals (3).

Therefore, the complementary probability of rain is 1-40% = 60%.\n\nStep 4: Determine the probability of rain and sun using complementary probabilities - Since there is no sun, the probabilities of having rain and sun are the product of the probability of rain and the probability of no sun.
