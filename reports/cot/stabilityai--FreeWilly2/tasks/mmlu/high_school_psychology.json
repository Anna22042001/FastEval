            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer for this question, let's break it down step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question.\nThe question asks for the cause of nearsightedness specifically related to the curvature of the cornea, lens, and iris.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate irrelevant options.\nSince this question is focused on the curvature of specific parts, we can eliminate options that include \"iris,\" as this is not related to the curvature causing nearsightedness. So, options (C) and (D) are not relevant.\n\nStep 3: Compare relevant options and evaluate them.\nNow, we are left with options (A) and (B), both pertaining to the curvature of the cornea and lens.\n\nStep 4: Determine the cause of nearsightedness.\nNearsightedness occurs when the eye focuses light in front of the retina instead of on it, either due to a longer eyeball or a too-strong bending of light by the cornea or lens. This condition is often treated by glasses or contact lenses to correct the focal point, allowing individuals to see more clearly at a distance.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct answer.\nSince nearsightedness is caused by a longer eyeball or a too-strong bending of light by the cornea or lens, we now know that option (B) is the correct choice, as it is related to a too little curvature.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) too little curvature of the cornea and lens",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question's context, which is to determine which psychological disorder is most characteristic of delusions of grandeur.\n\nStep 2: Know the difference between each disorder:\n(A) OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) - Characterized by intrusive, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing anxiety.\n(B) Schizophrenia - A mental disorder that affects a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly, often including delusions or hallucinations.\n(C) Conversion Disorder - A mental disorder where a person has physical symptoms, such as paralysis or blindness, that cannot be explained by an underlying physical cause.\n(D) Antisocial Personality Disorder - A personality disorder characterized by persistent manipulation and violation of the rights of others and a lack of empathy.\n\nStep 3: Identify which disorder is most characteristic of delusions of grandeur:\n- Delusions of grandeur are a type of delusion that involves an exaggerated belief in one's importance, abilities, or identity.\n- Schizophrenia is the most likely candidate for delusions of grandeur since it is directly related to symptoms such as grandiose delusions; however, OCD can also have delusions of grandeur as subtype.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision based on the gathered information and understanding:\nBoth OCD and schizophrenia can have delusions of grandeur, but in general, schizophrenia is more characteristic of this symptom. Therefore, the answer is:\n(B) Schizophrenia (S).",

It does not necessarily prioritize motives based on their importance to survival.\n\n(C) Expectancy-value: This approach deals with the expectations of success and the value assigned to outcomes.

This means that the offspring will have the same genetic material as their parent.\n\nStep 3: Assess the genetic variability\nSince cloned offspring have the same genetic material as their parent, genetic variability would be significantly reduced, and therefore, traits in the population can be attributed mainly to genetic factors.\n\nStep 4: Locate an appropriate answer\nThe answer should reflect the increased heritability due to the reduced genetic variation in cloned populations.\n\nStep 5: Select the answer\n(D) 75% would be the closest answer given the options, as a reduction in genetic variation would increase the heritability of the population.\n\nAnswer: (D)",
