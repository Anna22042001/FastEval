            "model_answer": "To choose the appropriate cannula size, we need to consider multiple factors such as flow rates, patient comfort, and risk of complications in an emergency situation.\n\n1. Flow Rates: A cannula insertion site should be large enough to allow rapid blood flow. Larger cannula sizes generally have higher flow rates.\n2. Patient Comfort: Smaller cannula sizes can be more comfortable for patients, reducing the risk of tissue damage and infection.\n3. Risk of Complications: In an emergency, a larger cannula size increases the risk of complications due to increased pressure. In this case, it's best to prioritize faster blood transfusion.\n4. Medical Knowledge (as of 2020): Larger cannula sizes are generally used for rapid blood transfusion because they facilitate greater blood flow rates.\n\nGiven these factors, the appropriate cannula size for a rapid blood transfusion in 2020 is (A) 18 gauge since it allows for faster blood flow while maintaining relatively comfortable patient experience.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, let's examine each of the options:\n\n(A) Strength: Strength is important, but it alone is not enough for successful marathon running. A strong runner may not have the endurance necessary for covering 26.2 miles.\n\n(B) Power: Power is related to strength and is also important to a certain extent, but marathon running requires sustained output over a long period of time, making pure power less relevant as a key attribute.\n\n(C) Stride Length: A longer stride length can translate to faster running, provided the runner maintains their pace and efficiency. While useful, this alone may not be sufficient for successful marathon running.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina refers to the ability to maintain prolonged effort. Considering that marathon racing demands continuous exertion over a significant distance, stamina is undoubtedly the most critical attribute for successful marathon running.\n\nAfter examining each option, the answer is:\n\n(D) stamina.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the variables involved\nWe have a scenario where the number of sprints is increasing. We are looking at the effects of this change on the variables mentioned.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each variable/option to identify its relation with an increasing number of sprints.\n\n(A) Anaerobic contribution: When the number of sprints are more without rest or recovery, the energy demand increases. To meet the sudden increase in energy demand, the body turns to anaerobic metabolism. Hence, the anaerobic contribution does tend to increase with more sprints.\n\n(B) pH of the muscle: Increasing the number of sprints can cause lactic acid to accumulate, decreasing the muscle pH. When the lactic acid concentration increases, the pH level typically decreases.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration: Increasing the number of sprints typically requires more energy, resulting in increased utilization of glucose. Glucose is the primary fuel for muscle cells. However, blood glucose concentration falling below 3 mmol/L (also known as hypoglycemia) is an extremely rare scenario in athletes who perform multiple sprints in a single session.\n\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism: The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism should increase with an increasing number of sprints. This is because the higher the number of sprints, the lower the lactate concentration becomes, meaning the body will cover more distance aerobically.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options to determine which variable best responds to an increasing number of sprints.\nAfter analyzing all the options, we can conclude that adding more sprints mostly results in increased anaerobic contribution and potentially an increased reliance on anaerobic metabolism, decreased relative contribution of aerobic metabolism, pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.\n\nAnswer: A, B, and D",
