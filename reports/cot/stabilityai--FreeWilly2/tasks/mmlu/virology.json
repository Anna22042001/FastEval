            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we first need to establish what human polyomaviruses are and gather information on the known number.\n\nStep 1: What are human polyomaviruses?\nPolyomaviruses are a group of small DNA viruses identified by their characteristic large T-antigens. They have the ability to transform cells and may be involved in the development of specific cancers. Among those, there are some known to infect human beings.\n\nStep 2: Research the current knowledge of human polyomaviruses\nTo find out the known number of human polyomaviruses, we can look for recent studies or reliable sources on the subject.\n\nAccording to the latest research published in the journal \"Virology\", as of 2021, 12 distinct human polyomaviruses have been identified, with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) identified as one of the most prevalent and potentially oncogenic.\n\nStep 3: Compare the information to the given options\nSince we found out that there are 12 identified human polyomaviruses, and the given options are 100, 1, 10, and unknown, we can conclude that the correct answer is not listed. We also know that the answer cannot be \"unknown\" as we have specific information available (12 identified human polyomaviruses).\n\nSo, the answer is not one of the given options.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "ment\n Step 1: Understanding the question\nThe question is asking about the impact of AIDS activism in the United States. We need to determine whether the activism resulted in (A) FDA reforms, (B) easier access to investigational drugs, (C) changes in medicine practice, or (D) all of the above.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the options\n(A) FDA reforms - AIDS activism put pressure on the FDA to speed up the drug approval process for HIV/AIDS treatments. This led the FDA to create new regulations for the accelerated approval of drugs in cases where there was an urgent need.\n\n(B) Easier access to investigational drugs - AIDS activism also called for easier access to investigational drugs in the early stages of HIV infection. This resulted in the creation of the FDA's Parallel Track program, which allowed terminally ill patients with HIV/AIDS to have access to medications before they were fully approved.\n\n(C) Changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. - AIDS activism led to changes in how medicine was practiced by increasing collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, and patients. This resulted in a more inclusive approach that considered the perspectives of different stakeholders.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\nGiven that AIDS activism led to (A) FDA reforms, (B) easier access to investigational drugs, and (C) changes in medicine practice, the correct answer is (D) all of the above.\n\nFinal answer: (D)",

Diarrheal diseases cause about 1.9 million deaths annually. Malaria is responsible for about 405,000 deaths yearly. Lastly, tuberculosis kills about 1.8 million people annually.\n\nStep 3: Determine which cause is responsible for the most deaths.\nComparing the number of deaths for each cause, it can be concluded that (C) Malaria causes the lowest number of deaths, (A) Respiratory infections cause the next lowest, (D) Tuberculosis is responsible for a higher number of deaths, and (B) Diarrheal diseases cause the most deaths globally.\n\nAnswer:\nB",

Option (C) states that this period commonly lasts for a few days, while option (B) describes virus replication happening at an intracellular level.\n\nStep 4: Select the option that directly describes the incubation period.\nOption (B) mainly focuses on virus replication within the cells.

However, innovation is often slow, and they might be too focused on their passion to bring their ideas about on a large scale.\n\n(B) Early adapters - These people quickly adopt innovations and are the first to use new products. They have the potential to influence others by being seen as innovators because they can become well-versed in the new technology or idea.\n\n(C) Middle adapters - These people wait until others have tried a new idea before implementing it, which means they often follow the early adapters. However, it might be too late for them to bring effective change.\n\n(D) Late adapters - These people take a long time to incorporate new things into their lives and may not want to change at all.
