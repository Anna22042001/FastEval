            "model_answer": "The Barkhausen criterion is a set of conditions that must be met for an electronic oscillator to function properly.\n\n(A) Loop gain should be unity - This means that the gain around the feedback loop of the oscillator should be exactly equal to 1 (0dB). If the gain is greater than 1, the oscillator will Initially, it might seem that (A) is the most important of the three criteria, but we must also consider the other two conditions.\n\n(B) Loop gain should be less than unity - This contradicts the information given in (A). However, it is not a typo. The input impedance of the active device of the oscillator must have an effective gain that is less than unity to prevent the oscillator's further growth in amplitude due to thermal noise. This is essential for the oscillator to maintain its oscillation amplitude within a suitable range.\n\n(C) The phase of a feedback signal with respect to the input signal should be 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0 - The phase shift between the input and feedback signals through the oscillator's feedback loop should be either 0\u00b0 or 360\u00b0 (equivalent to 0\u00b0). This ensures that the oscillator can sustain a stable oscillation, as any phase shift other than these two would result in a cancellation of signals or an unstable oscillation.\n\nConsidering all the above points, the final answer to the question must account for both necessary conditions while considering the additional information in (B). Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Both A and C",

We must identify the correct one.\n\nStep 2: Understand the potentiometer method\nThe potentiometer method is a method for measuring voltage in a circuit by using a potentiometer, which is a variable resistor, to compare the unknown voltage to well-known reference voltage sources. It helps to minimize any circuit loading effect.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n(A) It loads the circuit moderately: This option is correct because the potentiometer method loads the circuit moderately, which helps to minimize any circuit loading effect.\n\n(B) It loads the circuit to maximum extent: This option is incorrect because the potentiometer method is supposed to load the circuit moderately, not to the maximum extent.\n\n(C) It uses centre zero galvanometer instead of voltmeter: This option is incorrect because it does not directly address the reason why the potentiometer method is more accurate. It only describes the equipment used.\n\n(D) It does not load the circuit at all: This option is incorrect because the potentiometer method does load the circuit, although moderately.

            "model_answer": "Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n1. The problem mentions a single phase one pulse controlled circuit, which means there are two regions of operation \u2013 the conduction region and the non-conduction region during the time period it is operating.\n\n2. We are given the source voltage, which is E = 400 sin(314 t).\n\n3. We are given the load (load counter emf) equal to 200 V.\n\n4. The problem asks for the range of firing angle control. Firing angle is the time duration between the instant the voltage starts to rise and the instant at which the thyristor conducts. This duration is specified in degrees.\n\n5. From the given circuit and load, we know that there is a different voltage is for different angle and we can find the range of this angle.\n\nNow, we solve for the angle and find the range:\n\nFor the given information: Vload = 200 V, E = 400 sin(314 t), R = Resistance.\nThe voltage across the load (Vload) will be given by:\nVload = I * R (Ohm's law)\n\nWhere I (current through R) is given by:\n\nI = (E - Vload) / R\n\nWe have, Vload = 200 V and \nE = 400 sin(314 t)\n\nNow, let's put this into the equation:\n\nI = (400 sin(314 t) - 200) / R\n\nLet the firing angle \u03b8 be such that the current I = 0.\n\n0 = (400 sin(314 t - \u03b8) - 200) / R\n\nFiring angle range starts from \u03b8i and ends at \u03b8f. At \u03b8i, cos(314 t - \u03b8) starts to be positive (since cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrant). At \u03b8f, cos(314 t - \u03b8) starts to be negative (since cosine is negative in the second and third quadrant).\n\ncos(314 t - \u03b8) = 0\ncos(314 t - \u03b8i) = -1\ncos(314 t - \u03b8f) = 1\n\n-1 = cos(314 t - \u03b8i)\n1 = cos(314 t - \u03b8f)\n\n\u03b8i &thetaf is half of the range of cos.\n\n\u03b8i = (\u03c0 - cos\u207b\u00b9(-1)) / 314\n\u03b8f = (\u03c0 + cos\u207b\u00b9(1)) / 314\n\n\u03b8i \u2248 0\u00ba\n\u03b8f \u2248 120\u00ba\n\nTherefore, the range of firing angle control is (\u03b8i, \u03b8f) which is approximately (0\u00ba, 120\u00ba).\n\nNow let's look at the options:\n\n(A) 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n(B) 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n(C) 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.\n(D) 60\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBased on the range we found, the correct answer is (C) 60\u00b0 to 120\u00b0.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's first examine the purpose of resistance in a dynamometer wattmeter. A dynamometer wattmeter is an instrument designed to measure the power of an electric circuit. It can do this by converting an unknown current or voltage into proportionate deflections of a moving coil against a calibrated scale. These deflections are related to the wattage of the circuit.\n\nThe resistance against which the moving coil revolves must be adjusted to provide accurate measurements within the intended range. This means that the correct resistance level will depend on the specific application and requirements of the measurement.\n\nSince the moving coil in the wattmeter has a relatively low inertia, a high resistance will result in large deflections, potentially causing the readings to exceed the calibrated scale. Hence, a high resistance is not suitable for accurate measurements.\n\nOn the other hand, an extremely low or almost zero resistance might lead to very small deflections, making it difficult to measure the wattage accurately.\n\nAccounting for the ideal conditions for accurate measurements, the resistance in the circuit of the moving coil of a dynamometer wattmeter should be\n\n(B) Very low.\n\nThis provides enough force for clear deflections without exceeding the calibrated scale. However, it's important to note that the actual resistance value will ultimately depend on the specific wattmeter design, calibration, and the range and accuracy of the measurements needed.",
