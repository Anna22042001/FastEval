Going through the available options:\n\n(A) The magnetic field on Mars is too weak to directly strip away water significantly. While it may have played some role, it is unlikely to be the main cause. \n\n(B) Ultraviolet light can break water into hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydrogen can be lost through thermal escape. This may have contributed to some water loss on Mars, but it's uncertain if it's the primary mechanism since a majority of the water is still thought to be trapped on the planet.\n\n(C) As of now, there is no evidence of a Martian civilization that could have consumed the water, and therefore, it's an unlikely scenario.\n\n(D) Intense volcanism could have vaporized water, which could then escape through thermal escape. However, there isn't sufficient evidence to support this as the predominant water loss mechanism.\n\nConsidering the given options, I can't confirm any of the choices as the definitive answer.
