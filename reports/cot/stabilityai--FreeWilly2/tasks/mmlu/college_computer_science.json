This can be problematic, but it doesn't make the approach inherently difficult. Instead, it is more of an implementation challenge.\n\n(B) This statement claims that the approach cannot express complex protection requirements. If this is true, then it indeed presents a significant difficulty.\n\n(C) This issue asserts that the decision process for whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable, which would be a severe problem for the access matrix approach.\n\n(D) Claiming that there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix could raise issues with proper authorization of changes.\n\nStep 3: Choose the most significant difficulty.\n\nOut of the four options, option (B), (C), and (D) present more foundational issues than option (A). Option (B) has potential limitations in expressing complex protection requirements, (C) implies that the core functionality is inherently problematic, and (D) discusses challenges in defining access control itself.\n\nGiven the analysis, with (A) referring to a more technical implementation issue, the most significant difficulty from the given choices seems to be:\n\nAnswer: (C) deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable",
