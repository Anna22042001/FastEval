            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what it means for phases to be in equilibrium with each other in a mixture. Equilibrium means that as matter transfers between the different phases, the transfer rates are equal. \n\nIn a three-component mixture, the number of possible phases depends on the number of components in the mixture and the degrees of freedom available. The degrees of freedom depend on the degrees of attractions between the mixture compounds (i.e. how they interact with each other).\n\nLet's assume that each of the three components can bond freely to each other. This gives us a situation where components can form 4 different combinations, as we can pair two components together:\n\n- component 1 and 2\n- component 1 and 3\n- component 2 and 3\n- both component 1 and 2 with component 3\n\nIn any of these situations, the resulting combinations may form different phases based on their attraction and bonding capabilities.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\n1. First, we need to balance the given equation.\n2. Start with the I\u2212 ions. There are two I\u2212 ions on the left side, and one on the right side, so we need to multiply the I\u2212 ion in the products side by 2 to balance the equation:\n   __ MnO4\u2212 + __ I\u2212 + __ H+ <-> __ Mn2+ + 2(IO3\u2212)\n3. Next, balance the H+ ions. There are 3 H+ ions on the left side but only 1 on the right side. To balance the equation, we need to multiply the H+ ion on the reactants side by 3:\n   __ MnO4\u2212 + __ I\u2212 + 3(H+) <-> __ Mn2+ + 2(IO3\u2212) + __ H2O\n4. Now balance the Mn2+ and MnO4\u2212 ions. There are no MnO4\u2212 ions on the left side after balancing the I\u2212 and H+ ions, so there doesn't need to be any changes. Since there is one Mn2+ and one MnO4\u2212 ion on the right side, we have balanced these ions as well.\n5. Finally, balance the H2O molecule. Based on the above steps, the equation becomes:\n   __ MnO4\u2212 + __ I\u2212 + 3(H+) <-> 2(IO3\u2212) + 1(H2O)\n6. Multiply the IO3- on the products side by 2 to balance the amount of molecules containing oxygen, we get:\n   __ MnO4\u2212 + __ I\u2212 + 3(H+) <-> 4(IO3\u2212) + 1(H2O)\n\nAnswer: (C) The MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1. \n\nIn the balanced equation, there is one MnO4- ion on the reactants side and one Mn2+ ion on the products side. Thus, the MnO4- : Mn2+ ratio is 3:1.",
