First, we need to understand that there may not be a single clear answer to a question like this, as different factors can contribute to reduced reaction times.\n\n2. Now, let's analyze each proposed solution and determine which one may have the most significant impact on reducing the reaction time difference between younger and older adults:\n\n   (A) Practice regular aerobic exercise: Aerobic exercise increases blood flow and may improve cognitive function, potentially reducing the reaction time difference.\n\n   (B) Lift weights on a regular schedule: Weight training helps improve muscle strength and endurance, but it may not have a direct impact on reaction times.\n\n   (C) Consume large quantities of vitamins: Consuming large quantities of vitamins generally is not recommended. While a balanced diet may contribute to overall health and cognitive function, this may not be a direct factor in reducing the reaction time difference.\n\n   (D) Practice Tai chi: Tai chi is a form of exercise that incorporates physical and mental aspects, promoting balance, focus, and stress relief. This practice may have positive effects on cognitive function, potentially leading to better reaction times.\n\n3. Weighing the effects of each option, option (A) appears to be the most directly related to reduced reaction time differences between younger and older adults.\n\n4.
