            "question": "Which State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction in respect of crimes committed on board vessels?\n\n(A) The coastal State\n(B) The flag State\n(C) All States enjoy such jurisdiction\n(D) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking which authority, among the given options, has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (A)\nThe coastal State would typically have jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territorial waters, but the question states \"on board vessels.\" This suggests that the floating vessels are not necessarily within the boundaries of a specific coastal State.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nThe flag State is the country whose flag the vessel bears. It exercises authority over the vessel and its functions. In the context of crimes committed on board, it's more likely for the flag State to have jurisdiction than the coastal State.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption C states that all States enjoy jurisdiction. This is highly unlikely, as jurisdiction typically belongs to only one primary authority or, in some cases, certain specific international bodies. \n\nStep 5: Evaluate option (D)\nThe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an international organization that interprets the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. But it is not specifically responsible for crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nStep 6: Select the best answer\nAfter evaluating the options, it becomes clear that the best answer is (B) The flag State, as the authority of a vessel typically lies with the country whose flag it bears, especially when it comes to crimes committed on board.\n\nFinal Answer: (B)",

            "model_answer": "tReasoning:\n (A) First, let's break down the word 'justiciability'. It is a combination of 'justiciable', which refers to the quality of being legally enforceable in a court of law, and 'ability', which implies the possibility of something being done.\n\n(B) The definition of 'justiciability' should not be about the just or unjust nature of the right itself, but rather about the ability or possibility of enforcing the right.\n\n(C) The definition should not include the courts assessing whether the non-enforcement of a particular right conforms to principles of justice; this is a separate concept.\n\n(D) The definition should not be limited to the obligation of a State to enforce a particular right, as it is more about the potential for the enforcement or legal recognition of that right.\n\nGiven the reasoning above, the most suitable explanation of 'justiciability' is:\n\n(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the differences between R2P and humanitarian intervention\nStep 2: Break down the answer options to choose the correct one\nStep 3: Explain the differences and ultimate choose based on the best option\n\nR2P (Responsibility to Protect) is a global political commitment that aims to prevent and address large-scale atrocity crimes by allowing collective action through the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). This is done primarily to protect civilians from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.\n\nHumanitarian intervention is a unilateral action by a State, or a group of States, to intervene in another State for the purpose of protecting the population from imminent danger or removing a humanitarian threat.\n\nThe four options:\n\n(A) R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention\n(B) R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis\n(D) R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not\n\n(A) is incorrect because they are distinct concepts.\n(B) is incorrect because a call for assistance by the State is not a requirement for R2P intervention.\n(D) is incorrect because R2P may involve non-military mechanisms to protect civilians.\n\nExplanation of answer:\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThis answer choice is correct because R2P demands some UNSC input, which makes it less arbitrary compared to unilateral humanitarian intervention. Furthermore, the primary objective of R2P is to avert humanitarian crises, which means that prevention is central, unlike many humanitarian interventions that might occur after a crisis has already emerged.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in multiple sources, such as legislation, common law, conventions, and court judgments.\n\n(D) The UK Constitution is based on a Bill of Rights.\nThis statement is false, as the UK does not have a single document that constitutes a Bill of Rights.

Option B is the most fitting due to it explaining that having international legal personality means having a capacity to enforce rights and duties under international law and applies to relevant actors, not just States.\n4. Option C is not correct as international legal personality doesn't refer to challenging State authority, but rather the rights and duties established under international law.\n5.
