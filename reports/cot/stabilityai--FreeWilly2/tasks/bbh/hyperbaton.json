However, \"German\" and \"drinking\" seem to be interchanged, making the adjective order slightly inaccurate.\n\nOption B: brand-new, drinking, German, enormous.\nIn Option B, \"brand-new\" is placed correctly as it represents age. \"drinking\" is for the purpose and follows age appropriately. \"German\" indicates origin and is also placed correctly. \"enormous\" is the only adjective out of place in this order.\n\nFinal Analysis: In both options, there is an adjective that is out of place from the expected typical adjective order. However, the adjective order in Option B is closer to the standard adjective order than Option A.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
