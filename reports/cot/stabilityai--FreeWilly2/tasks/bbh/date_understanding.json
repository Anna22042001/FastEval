To find the date for tomorrow, we need to add 1 day to the current date.\n\nStep 1:\nDetermine the current month, day, and year from the given date (7/9/1972).\nMonth = 7 (since the month is given in the format MM)\nDay = 9\nYear = 1972\n\nStep 2:\nAdd 1 day to the current date.\nMonth = 7\nDay = (9 + 1) = 10 (carry the 1 to the year)\nYear = (1972 + 1) = 1973\n\nStep 3:\nWe have 1 carried over. Since we have 1, we add it to the year.\nYear = 1973 + 1 = 1974\n\nNow, we have the new date in MM/DD/YYYY format: 07/10/1974.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the date in MM/DD/YYYY for the given options. The closest option to our calculation is:\n\n(D) 07/09/1972\n\nAnswer: D",
