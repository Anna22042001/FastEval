While some gonorrhea infections are asymptomatic, the majority of them have noticeable symptoms.\n\n(D) infections are limited to genital areas:\nThis statement is not always true as gonorrhea can also infect other areas, such as the mouth and throat (oropharyngeal gonorrhea) or the anus and rectum (anal gonorrhea) in addition to genital infections.\n\nConsidering the analysis above, all statements (A), (B), and (C) are true, while (D) is not always true.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question asks us to determine which emotion women were more likely to experience following their first act of intercourse according to a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz (1995). Let's first review each option:\n\n(A) felt glad\n(B) felt fear\n(C) experienced guilt\n(D) experienced regret\n\nThe study suggests that women have a more emotional response to their first sexual experience than men do. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A) felt glad, as it seems less likely compared to the other options.\n\nTo determine which of the remaining options is the correct answer, let's further analyze them step by step, taking into account the possible reasons why women might experience different emotions.\n\n(B) felt fear\n- Women might experience fear due to the lack of trust, insecurity, or an uncomfortable environment. However, this option does not specify whether the fear was due to the sexual act itself or was influenced by external factors.\n\n(C) experienced guilt\n- Women could feel guilty if they come from a religious or cultural background that disapproves of premarital sex, or if they felt they went against their values or beliefs. This guilt might be associated with the act of intercourse.\n\n(D) experienced regret\n- Women might feel regret later on, either because they didn't make the most informed choice or felt pressured into the act. It can also be linked to doubts about their partner or the context in which the intercourse took place.\n\nBased on these reasons and the fact that women's emotional responses tend to be more complex, option (C) experienced guilt and option (D) experienced regret are both likely outcomes after the first act of intercourse.\n\nTherefore, the final line with the answer as a single letter with parenthesis is:\n\nC",
