            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "In order to determine which of the fuzzing techniques is more likely to cover all the lines of code in the given program, we should analyze the characteristics of each method:\n\n1. Generational: Generational fuzzers generate random input sequences using a grammar or lexicon that aligns with the input format of the target application. While they can find some interesting path dependencies, they may partially cover target aspects.\n\n2. Blackbox: Blackbox fuzzers rely on the repetitive applications of test cases to check for bugs or vulnerabilities. They typically lack the knowledge of the internal code structure and dependencies, making them less effective at covering all paths.\n\n3. Whitebox: Whitebox fuzzers have access to internal code structures and dependencies, which provides them with the advantage of determining the best-suited input sets to target specific lines of code and increase coverage.\n\n4. Mutation-based: Mutation-based fuzzers rely on the manipulation of existing input sets to create new test cases. This can be helpful, but doesn't guarantee 100% path coverage.\n\nGiven the provided options, Whitebox fuzzers are the most likely to explore paths covering every line of code, as they offer access to internal structures and better path coverage.\n\n(C)",

What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

            "question": "Consider the paper Native Client: A Sandbox for Portable, Untrusted x86 Native Code by Yee et al. Ben Bitdiddle notes that NaCl uses Intel x86 segmentation to ensure that the sandboxed module does not read or write memory outside its own data area, and does not execute instructions outside its own code. Ben thinks that with these restrictions alone, executing the sandboxed module must be safe; that is, he thinks validation is not needed. Ben is wrong. Circle the types of x86 machine instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code. Please ignore trampoline and springboard code.\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable)\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable)",

The question refers to Native Client (NaCl), which is a sandbox for portable, untrusted x86 native code.\n2. Ben Bitdiddle believes that safety is ensured by sandboxed modules through Intel x86 segmentation, preventing access to memory or instructions outside the module's own area.\n3. Ben believes validation is not necessary, but the question prompt states he is wrong.\n4. We need to identify the types of x86 instructions that the validator always forbids in sandboxed code.\n\nLooking at the possible answer choices:\n\n(A) all instructions that modify segment state: This does not directly relate to the safety concerns posed in the question, so it is not the correct answer.\n(B) all loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32: This also does not directly address the safety concerns.\n(C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable): This one seems relevant, as indirect access via registers or variables can lead to unintended memory access outside of a module, posing a security risk.\n(D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable): This one also seems relevant for the same reasons as (C).\n\nAfter considering the possible answers, we can conclude:\n\nThe validator always forbids (C) all indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable) and (D) all indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable) in sandboxed code, as they pose a security risk.\n\nAnswer: (CD)",
