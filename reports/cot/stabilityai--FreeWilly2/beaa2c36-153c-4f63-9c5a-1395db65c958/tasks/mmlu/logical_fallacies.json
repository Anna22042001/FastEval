This is a key characteristic of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (B)\n(B) does not address a specific requirement of a major premise in a disjunctive syllogism. It may be a characteristic of a premise in a different type of logical argument.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option (C)\n(C) is a description of an action that can be taken with a major premise. However, it does not directly describe a key characteristic of the major premise in a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate option (D)\n(D) describes the outcome that should be achieved with a disjunctive syllogism. However, it does not directly describe a key characteristic of the major premise of a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nStep 7: Conclude the evaluation.\nFrom the evaluation, option (A) is the primary characteristic of a major premise in a disjunctive syllogism.\n\nFinal output: A",
