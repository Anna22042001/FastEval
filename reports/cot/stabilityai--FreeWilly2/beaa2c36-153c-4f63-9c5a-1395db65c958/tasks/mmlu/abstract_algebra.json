The commutator subgroup of G, [G,G], is normal in G by definition. If [G,G] = {e}, then G is Abelian. If [G,G] is not the trivial subgroup, then G is non-Abelian. Since [G,G] is normal in G, it leads to the factor group G/[G,G].

Hence, the factor group G/[G,G] would be non-Abelian.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is True.\n\nStatement 2 | If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nIf K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then we can say that K is a subgroup of H, and H is a subgroup of G. Since H is normal in G, its subgroups are also normal in H, and therefore, K is normal in H. If H is also normal in G, this means the conjugation action of G on H permutes the elements of H, thereby preserving the cosets of K in H, and making K a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is True.\n\nNow that we have analyzed both statements, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n(A) True, True",

The order of such a group is equal to the order of its generator, which is 15. Therefore, the group must contain a unique element of order 15. Furthermore, a unique element of order 15 can generate a total of 8 elements of order 15, including itself. Hence, this statement is True.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15.\n\nReasoning: If a group has more than 8 but less than 16 elements of order 15, this is consistent with the statement that a group must have at least 8 elements of order 15. However, if the group has more than 15 elements but not 16 elements, it may still have more unique elements of order 15 to satisfy the condition. So, we cannot conclusively determine whether the group must have at least 16 elements of order 15 based on the information given. Thus, this statement is False.\n\n(C) True, False",
