Three nonstate actors (A, B, and C) are listed. After analyzing (A), (B), and (C), we see that terrorists, organized crime, and drug traffickers all pose a threat to the United States.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question by providing the option that does not pose a threat to the United States. \n\nSince none of the nonstate actors listed do not pose a threat to the United States, there isn't a correct answer that matches the question's criteria. We should provide the option \"China\" (D) as the answer to meet the requirement for providing a single-letter response. This is because China is a state actor and not a nonstate actor.

His policies were focused on domestic reforms through his New Deal initiatives. The turmoil in Europe was not directly impacting the United States and, at the time, US public opinion was against intervening in the European conflict.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate unnecessary options\nConsidering the context and relevant factors, options (B) and (C) are clearly unrelated to the reasons behind FDR's isolationist approach. Option (C) is completely incorrect as FDR eventually led the US to join WWII.\n\nStep 5: Select the most plausible option\nOption (A) directly addresses FDR's belief in domestic reform over international negotiation as the key to the US's economic regeneration.

It was characterized by a focus on the interests of the average citizen, as opposed to powerful elites. This movement aimed to strengthen democracy and make the political system more responsive to public opinion.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options\n(A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment: An ideology focused on limiting the involvement of a country in international affairs, with an emphasis on domestic issues.\n(B) A strand of internationalist sentiment: An ideology focused on cooperation and involvement in international affairs.\n(C) An expression of American cultural superiority: A belief in the superiority of American culture and values compared to others.\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making: A policy-making approach that takes into account the views and preferences of the general public.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option in relation to the New Populism\n\n(A) Neo-isolationist sentiment: Not an exact match with the New Populism, as the movement focused primarily on making the political system more responsive to public opinion, not necessarily limiting international involvement.\n(B) Internationalist sentiment: While one of the goals of New Populism was to strengthen democracy and accountability, international cooperation and involvement was not the central focus of the movement.\n(C) American cultural superiority: While the New Populism focused on American interests and values, it wasn't explicitly an expression of American cultural superiority.\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making: This is the closest match, as the New Populism emphasized the importance of public opinion in shaping policy, including foreign policy.\n\nBased on the above analysis and comparison with the given options, the closest match for the \"New Populism\" is:\n\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making",

This is not supported by historical evidence.\n\n(C) European countries did pay the United States for assistance, but this direct payment wasn't the main reason for the shift in economic power.\n\n(D) Europe spent heavily on the war, causing a rise in their external debt.
