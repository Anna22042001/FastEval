            "question": "The main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically is the lack of\n\n(A) a currency.\n(B) a well-connected transportation infrastructure.\n(C) government activity.\n(D) a banking service.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) A currency is important for an economy, but it is not the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing. Subsistence economies often operate on a barter system, so they may not have a standardized currency, but the lack of currency is not the main factor holding them back.\n\n(B) A well-connected transportation infrastructure allows the movement of goods, services, and people, which is an essential component for a growing economy. However, while it is a limiting factor for subsistence economies, it is not the main hindrance preventing their advancement.\n\n(C) Government activity plays a critical role in promoting economic growth by establishing laws, regulations, public services, and infrastructure projects. In subsistence economies, government activity might be limited, but it is not the main barrier holding them back economically.\n\n(D) A banking service is vital for the growth of an economy, as it supports the accumulation of savings, lending, investing, and capital formation. The lack of banking services in a subsistence economy restricts its ability to accumulate wealth and invest in economic opportunities. This lack of banking services is the main factor preventing subsistence economies from advancing economically.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n(D) a banking service.",

The answers are A) push factors, B) pull factors, C) distance decay, and D) migration selectivity.\n3. Push factors and pull factors relate to the reasons why people migrate, not to how the tendency for migration decreases with distance.\n4. Migration selectivity is the process of selecting who is allowed to migrate, not about the distance and its effect on migration.\n5. Distance decay refers to the decline in interaction with increasing distance, including migration.\n\nSo the answer is:\n(C) distance decay.",

Analyzing each zone in the context of low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration:\n\n(A) First: This zone is the Central Business District (CBD), which typically includes high-end businesses and large financial institutions and is unlikely to have low-income slums and ethnic ghettos. \n(B) Second: This zone is the manufacturing and warehouse area, often called the Industrial Zone. While this area may have some signs of deterioration, it typically is not the location for low-income slums or ethnic ghettos.\n(C) Third: This zone, also known as the Ethnic Transition Zone or Zone in Transition, is characterized by the presence of low-income slums, ethnic enclaves, and deterioration.\n(D) Fourth: This zone, also called the Outer City, consists mostly of working- and middle-class residential areas with less evidence of low-income slums or ethnic ghettos.\n\nConsidering the characteristics of low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Third",

Additionally, it doesn't fully explain the high population density.\n\n(D) Access to trade routes: Settling along coastlines and rivers generally provides early settlers with easy access to essential resources and the capability to trade more efficiently. Water bodies provide good transport routes, which in turn can support a larger population.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best attribution for early settlements and high population density along coastlines and rivers appears to be:\n\n(D) Access to trade routes",
