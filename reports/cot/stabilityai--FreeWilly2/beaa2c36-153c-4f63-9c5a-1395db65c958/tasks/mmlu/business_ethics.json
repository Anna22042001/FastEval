            "model_answer": "Analyzing the statement:\n\n1. The prompt mentions that trading in bitcoin can be considered a mainstream activity which points toward digital currencies being involved. Option A or C should be the answer choices since they both mention 'cryptocurrencies'.\n\n2. The prompt mentions that trading in bitcoin has ethical implications associated with their usage. These can be classified as pros and cons.\n   - Pros: Cryptocurrencies are (***), and more (***).\n   - Cons: They have also been used to engage in (***).\n\n3. Among the cons, the financial crime can be linked to 'cryptocurrencies'. However, it is mentioned in both options A and C, while expensive, secure, and charitable giving are the opposite directions.\n\nSince the prompt does not have any information to support these opposing statements, options B and D can be eliminated.\n\nBetween options A and C, option A correctly mentions that 'cryptocurrencies' are expensive and secure, which are positive attributes, and option C does not mention those positively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime.",

Hedonistic Utilitarianism: Focuses on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people.\n\nB. Preference Utilitarianism: Focuses on maximizing the satisfaction of individual preferences.\n\nC. The Categorical Imperative: Emphasizes acting according to universal maxims that treat people as ends rather than means.\n\nD. Ethics of Care: Emphasizes the importance of caring relationships and empathy in making moral decisions.\n\nStep 2: Determine which theory is most similar to corporate profit maximization\n\nCorporate profit maximization is aimed at maximizing the financial gains of a corporation. This objective prioritizes the interests of the corporation over other stakeholders and society in general.\n\nIn comparison, (A) hedonistic utilitarianism focuses on the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, which would not align with corporate profit maximization as it prioritizes profit over happiness.\n\n(B) Preference utilitarianism focuses on maximizing satisfaction of individual preferences, which can be a part of corporate profit maximization to some extent, as corporate decisions are driven by stakeholder preferences. However, the primary focus is still on profit maximization rather than preference satisfaction.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative suggests that one should act based on universal maxims that treat people as ends rather than means. This is not directly related to corporate profit maximization, as it tends to emphasize the philosophical principle that one should act morally without personal benefit.\n\n(D) Ethics of Care focuses on caring relationships and empathy, which implies putting the well-being of others at the forefront of decision-making. This is not primarily focused on profit maximization, but rather on the promotion of care and empathy in ethical decision-making.\n\nStep 3: Output the answer\n\nB",
