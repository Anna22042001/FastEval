The apples are the cheapest.\n4. The kiwis are more expensive than the pears.\n5. The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons.\n6. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the oranges are the third-most expensive. This means there are two fruits that are more expensive than the oranges. From statement 1, we know that loquats are not one of these two fruits because they are less expensive than the oranges. From statement 5, we know that mangoes are more expensive than at least one fruit (watermelons), but we don't know if they are more expensive than oranges. From statement 6, we know that loquats are more expensive than kiwis, but again, we don't know if either of these fruits are more expensive than oranges.\n\nThe only fruit we haven't mentioned yet is the apples, but from statement 3, we know that they are the cheapest, so they can't be more expensive than the oranges.\n\nSo, based on the information given, we can't determine which two fruits are more expensive than the oranges. However, we do know from statement 2 that the oranges are the third-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) The oranges are the third-most expensive.",

This gives us a fixed position for the cardinal.\n4. The owl is to the left of the cardinal. This means the owl cannot be to the right of the cardinal.\n5. The raven is the third from the right. This gives us a fixed position for the raven.\n6. The falcon is the rightmost. This gives us a fixed position for the falcon.\n\nNow, let's try to arrange the birds according to these clues:\n\n- The cardinal is the second from the left, so the first position from the left could be the owl (since it's to the left of the cardinal) or the quail (since it's to the left of the hummingbird).\n- The raven is the third from the right, so it's in the fifth position from the left.\n- The falcon is the rightmost bird, so it's in the seventh position from the left.\n\nSo, the arrangement could look something like this:\n\n1. Owl/Quail\n2. Cardinal\n3. ?\n4. ?\n5. Raven\n6. ?\n7. Falcon\n\nThe hummingbird must be to the left of the raven and to the right of the quail, so it must be in the fourth position. The quail must be to the left of the hummingbird, so it must be in the third position. The owl must be to the left of the cardinal, so it must be in the first position. The only bird left is the hawk, which must be in the sixth position.\n\nSo, the final arrangement is:\n\n1. Owl\n2. Cardinal\n3. Quail\n4. Hummingbird\n5. Raven\n6. Hawk\n7. Falcon\n\nSo, the rightmost bird is the falcon.\n\n(D) The falcon is the rightmost",

This means Ana cannot be last, but it doesn't tell us exactly where Ana or Ada are.\n\n3. Amy finished last. This is straightforward and tells us the position of Amy.\n\n4. Dan finished below Rob. Since we know Dan finished third, this means Rob must be either first or second.\n\n5. Eve finished below Ada. This means Eve cannot be first, but it doesn't tell us exactly where Eve or Ada are.\n\n6. Rob finished below Joe. Since we know Rob is either first or second, this means Joe must be first.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that Dan is the one who finished third.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) Dan finished third.",
