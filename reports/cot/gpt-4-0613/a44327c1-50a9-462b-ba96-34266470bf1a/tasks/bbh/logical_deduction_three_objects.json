            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the information given in the paragraph. \n\nWe know that there are three vehicles: a hatchback, a limousine, and a station wagon. \n\nThe paragraph tells us two things about their ages:\n\n1. The station wagon is older than the hatchback.\n2. The hatchback is the second-newest.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the station wagon is not the newest. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the hatchback is not the newest or the oldest, but the second-newest. \n\nThis leaves only one vehicle, the limousine, which must be the newest. \n\nSince the station wagon is older than the hatchback, and the hatchback is the second-newest, this means that the station wagon must be the oldest. \n\nSo, the order from oldest to newest is: station wagon, hatchback, limousine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) The hatchback is the second-newest.",

This means that the blue book cannot be the leftmost book, and the yellow book cannot be the rightmost book.\n\n2. The orange book is the second from the left. This means that the orange book cannot be the leftmost or the rightmost book.\n\nFrom these two pieces of information, we can deduce that the only book that can be the rightmost book is the blue book. The yellow book must be to the left of the blue book, and the orange book must be to the left of both, making it the second from the left.\n\nSo, the order of the books from left to right is: Orange, Yellow, Blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(C) The blue book is the rightmost.",
