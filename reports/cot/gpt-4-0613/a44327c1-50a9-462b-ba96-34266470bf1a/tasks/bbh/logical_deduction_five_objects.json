This means Joe is somewhere above Eli in the order, but we don't know exactly where yet.\n4. Joe finished below Mya. This means Joe is somewhere below Mya in the order.\n\nFrom these statements, we can start to form an order. We know Eve is first. We know that Rob is above Mya and Joe is below Mya, so Mya is somewhere in the middle. Joe is above Eli, so Eli is last. This leaves Rob and Joe to fill the second and third spots. Since Rob is above Mya and Joe is below Mya, Rob must be second and Joe must be third. \n\nSo the final order is: Eve, Rob, Mya, Joe, Eli.\n\nThe second-to-last position is Joe.\n\nSo the answer is (C) Joe finished second-to-last.",

The tractor is older than the hatchback. This means the hatchback is newer than the tractor.\n3. The minivan is the third-newest. This means there are two vehicles newer than the minivan and two vehicles older than the minivan.\n4. The station wagon is the second-newest. This means there is one vehicle newer than the station wagon and three vehicles older than the station wagon.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that the sedan is the newest vehicle because it is newer than the minivan, which is the third-newest. The station wagon is the second-newest. The minivan is the third-newest. \n\nThe two remaining vehicles are the tractor and the hatchback. Since the hatchback is newer than the tractor, the hatchback must be the fourth-newest (or second-oldest) and the tractor is the oldest.\n\nSo, the order from newest to oldest is: Sedan, Station Wagon, Minivan, Hatchback, Tractor.\n\nTherefore, the hatchback is the second-oldest.\n\n(E) The hatchback is the second-oldest.",
