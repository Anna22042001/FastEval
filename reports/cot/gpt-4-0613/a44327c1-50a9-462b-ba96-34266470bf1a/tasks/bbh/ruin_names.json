It's not an edit or a pun, so it's not humorous.\n(C) & fire - This is just one part of the original name. It's not an edit or a pun, so it's not humorous.\n(D) earth - This is just one part of the original name. It's not an edit or a pun, so it's not humorous.\n(E) bind - This is a play on 'wind', replacing the 'w' with a 'b'. It could be seen as a pun, as 'bind' is a word with a different meaning.
