A wheel wobbling a few millimeters might not necessarily make a bike unsafe.\n\n(B) Her wheel wobbling several feet in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe\nThis statement is clearly exaggerated. A wheel wobbling several feet would obviously make the bike unsafe.

While there may be some Muslims who participate in Christmas festivities due to cultural influences or personal choice, it is not a part of their religious practices.\n\nTherefore, saying \"Muslims love celebrating Christmas\" could be seen as sarcastic because it contradicts the general religious practices of Muslims. \n\nOn the other hand, \"Muslims love celebrating Eid\" is a factual statement as Eid is a significant celebration in Islam.\n\nSo, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n(A) Muslims love celebrating Christmas.",

This statement seems to be stating a fact rather than being sarcastic.\n\nHowever, sarcasm can be subjective and depends on the context in which the statement is made. If the context is such that Hitler is being praised or glorified, then statement (A) could be seen as sarcastic because Hitler is widely regarded as a dictator and not a warrior. Similarly, if the context is such that Hitler is being criticized or condemned, then statement (B) could be seen as sarcastic because it's stating the obvious that Hitler was a demagogue.\n\nWithout any context, it's difficult to definitively say which statement is sarcastic. But based on the general perception of Hitler, statement (A) could be seen as sarcastic because it's praising Hitler as a warrior, which is contrary to the widely accepted view of him as a dictator.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Just like Hitler.

            "model_answer": "Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that mocks, ridicules, or expresses contempt. It's often used to say the opposite of what you mean ironically. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\n(A) \"What a wonderful, baseless accusation\" - This statement is sarcastic because the speaker is saying the accusation is \"wonderful\" when it's clear from the context (\"baseless accusation\") that they don't actually think it's wonderful. They're using \"wonderful\" ironically to express their displeasure or annoyance.\n\n(B) \"What a striking, baseless accusation\" - This statement could be interpreted as sarcastic, but it's less clearly so than option A. \"Striking\" could mean \"noticeable\" or \"impressive,\" which might be a sincere reaction to a baseless accusation. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure if this statement is sarcastic.\n\nSo, based on the definitions and the context provided, the most clearly sarcastic statement is option A.\n\n(A)",

This statement seems sincere. The speaker is expressing happiness in feeding elephants, which are indeed an endangered species. There's no apparent irony or mockery here.\n\n(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species. This statement is sarcastic. The speaker is saying they're happy to \"feed the trolls,\" a phrase often used to mean engaging with people who are deliberately provocative or offensive online. The sarcasm comes in when the speaker refers to these trolls as a \"woefully endangered species,\" which is clearly not true and is meant to mock or ridicule.\n\nSo, the sarcastic statement is (B) You're welcome my dear friend.

Yeah, no one is rewatching\n\nOption A is sarcastic because it's saying the film received the lowest gross sales, implying it wasn't popular or successful, and then follows up with \"Yeah, no one is rewatching,\" which is a sarcastic remark because it's expected that a film with low sales wouldn't be rewatched. \n\nOption B, on the other hand, is not sarcastic because it's stating a positive fact (highest gross sales) and then follows up with a negative comment (\"Yeah, no one is rewatching\") which doesn't align with the initial positive statement.
