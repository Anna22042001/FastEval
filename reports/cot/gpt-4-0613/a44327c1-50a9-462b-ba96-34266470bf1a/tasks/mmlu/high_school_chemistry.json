            "model_answer": "The empirical formula of a compound gives the simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.\n\nStep 1: Determine the mass of oxygen in the compound. We know the total mass of the compound and the masses of carbon and hydrogen. We can find the mass of oxygen by subtracting the masses of carbon and hydrogen from the total mass. \n\nTotal mass = mass of carbon + mass of hydrogen + mass of oxygen\nSo, mass of oxygen = total mass - mass of carbon - mass of hydrogen\n= 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g\n= 8.00 g\n\nStep 2: Convert the masses of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen to moles. We do this by dividing the mass of each element by its atomic mass. The atomic masses of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are approximately 12.01 g/mol, 1.01 g/mol, and 16.00 g/mol, respectively.\n\nMoles of carbon = 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol = 1.50 mol\nMoles of hydrogen = 3.03 g / 1.01 g/mol = 3.00 mol\nMoles of oxygen = 8.00 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.50 mol\n\nStep 3: Determine the ratio of moles of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. We do this by dividing the number of moles of each element by the smallest number of moles calculated in step 2.\n\nRatio of carbon = 1.50 mol / 0.50 mol = 3\nRatio of hydrogen = 3.00 mol / 0.50 mol = 6\nRatio of oxygen = 0.50 mol / 0.50 mol = 1\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is C3H6O1, which is equivalent to C3H6O. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) C3H6O.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The strength of an acid is determined by its ability to donate a proton (H+ ion). The more readily an acid donates a proton, the stronger the acid is. \n\nIn general, the strength of an acid increases with increasing electronegativity and decreasing bond strength. \n\nHClO and HBrO are both oxyacids, and the strength of an oxyacid increases with the electronegativity of the central atom. Chlorine is more electronegative than bromine, so HClO is stronger than HBrO.\n\nH2SO3 and H2SeO3 are also oxyacids. Sulfur and selenium are in the same group of the periodic table, but sulfur is above selenium, making it more electronegative. Therefore, H2SO3 is stronger than H2SeO3.\n\nComparing across the different types of acids, HClO and HBrO are stronger than H2SO3 and H2SeO3 because the oxygen in the oxyacids pulls electron density away from the hydrogen, making it easier for the hydrogen to be donated as a proton.\n\nSo, the correct order of increasing acid strength is HBrO < HClO < H2SeO3 < H2SO3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) HBrO < HClO < H2SeO3 < H2SO3.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to calculate the molar mass of propane (C3H8). \n\nThe molar mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol and the molar mass of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.01 g/mol. \n\nSince propane has 3 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms, its molar mass is (3*12.01 g/mol) + (8*1.01 g/mol) = 36.03 g/mol + 8.08 g/mol = 44.11 g/mol.\n\nNext, we use the formula for calculating the number of moles, which is mass (in grams) divided by molar mass (in g/mol). \n\nSo, the number of moles of propane in 6.2 g is 6.2 g / 44.11 g/mol = 0.140 mol.\n\nThis is approximately 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.",

However, the half-life of a first order reaction is independent of the initial concentration of the reactant. Therefore, increasing the initial concentration of SO2Cl2 will not increase the half-life of the reaction.\n\n(B) Increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs: The rate constant k in the half-life equation is temperature dependent. According to the Arrhenius equation, as the temperature increases, the rate constant k also increases. Since the half-life is inversely proportional to the rate constant, increasing the temperature will decrease the half-life of the reaction, not increase it.\n\n(C) Decreasing the overall pressure in the container: The pressure of a system does not affect the half-life of a first order reaction.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. The Pauling scale is the most commonly used. Fluorine (the most electronegative element) is assigned a value of 4.0, and values range down to cesium and francium which are the least electronegative at 0.7.\n\nIn the periodic table, electronegativity generally increases from left to right across a period and decreases down a group. This is because as you move across a period, the number of charges on the nucleus increases which tends to draw the electrons closer to the nucleus and increases the atom's ability to attract electrons in a bond. But as you move down a group, the additional shells of electrons between the nucleus and the outer shell reduce the nucleus' pull on the outer electrons and its ability to attract electrons in a bond.\n\nNitrogen is to the right of phosphorus and to the left of oxygen in the periodic table. Therefore, nitrogen's electronegativity is greater than that of phosphorus (because nitrogen is to the right of phosphorus) and less than that of oxygen (because nitrogen is to the left of oxygen).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) The value for nitrogen is greater than that of phosphorus because nitrogen is smaller, but less than that of oxygen because nitrogen has a smaller effective nuclear charge. \n\n(D)",
