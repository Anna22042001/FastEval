            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The development of the palate is a complex process that involves the fusion of several embryonic structures. The primary palate is formed by the fusion of the frontonasal process, while the secondary palate is formed by the fusion of the palatine processes. \n\nA complete bilateral cleft palate occurs when there is a failure of fusion of the palatine processes. This is because the palatine processes are responsible for the formation of the majority of the hard and soft palate. \n\nThe frontonasal and secondary nasal processes are involved in the formation of the primary palate and the upper lip, so a defect in these structures would result in a cleft lip or a cleft of the primary palate, not a complete bilateral cleft palate. \n\nThe mandibular processes are involved in the formation of the lower jaw, so a defect in these structures would result in a deformity of the lower jaw, not a cleft palate.\n\nTherefore, a complete bilateral cleft palate is due to a failure of fusion of the palatine processes.\n\n(A) palatine processes.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "During quiet inspiration, the primary muscles that are active are those that increase the size of the thoracic cavity, allowing the lungs to expand and draw in air. \n\nThe external intercostal muscles, which are located between the ribs, contract to elevate the ribs and sternum, increasing the front-to-back dimension of the thoracic cavity.\n\nThe diaphragm, a dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs, contracts and flattens, increasing the top-to-bottom dimension of the thoracic cavity.\n\nThe internal intercostal muscles are primarily involved in forced expiration, not quiet inspiration. They help decrease the size of the thoracic cavity by pulling the ribs downward and inward when they contract.\n\nTherefore, the muscles normally active during quiet inspiration are the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.",

However, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle is not - it is derived from the second brachial arch.\n\n(C) As mentioned above, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle is not derived from the first brachial arch, so this option is incorrect.\n\n(D) The geniohyoid muscle is not derived from the first brachial arch - it is derived from the first pharyngeal arch (or branchial arch), which is a different structure.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) The muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric.",

            "model_answer": "The motion of bending the forearm toward the body is described by one of the four terms given. \n\n(A) Abduction is the movement of a body part away from the midline of the body. This is not the correct term because bending the forearm toward the body is a movement towards the midline, not away from it.\n\n(B) Eversion is the movement of the sole of the foot away from the median plane. This term is related to foot movement, not arm movement, so it is not the correct term.\n\n(C) Flexion is the bending of a joint that decreases the angle between the bones of the joint. When you bend your forearm toward your body, you are decreasing the angle between your upper arm and your forearm, which is a description of flexion.\n\n(D) Pronation is the rotation of the hand and forearm so that the palm faces backwards or downwards. This term describes a rotational movement, not the bending movement of the forearm toward the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct term that describes the motion of bending the forearm toward the body is flexion.\n\n(C) Flexion",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The process of fertilization involves the fusion of an ovum (egg cell) and a spermatozoon (sperm cell) to form a single cell called a zygote. This process does not occur in the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. The cervix is not the site of fertilization, but rather serves as a passage for sperm to reach the upper parts of the female reproductive system.\n\nFertilization also does not occur in the ovary. The ovary is where the ovum is produced and released during ovulation, but it is not the site of fertilization.\n\nThe uterus is where the fertilized egg (zygote) implants and develops into a fetus. However, fertilization does not occur in the uterus. The uterus is the final destination for the fertilized egg, not the site of fertilization.\n\nThe fallopian tube, on the other hand, is where fertilization typically occurs. After an ovum is released from the ovary during ovulation, it travels into the fallopian tube. If sperm are present in the fallopian tube after sexual intercourse, one can fertilize the ovum to form a zygote.\n\nTherefore, fertilization of an ovum by a spermatozoon occurs in the fallopian tube.\n\n(B) Fallopian tube",

This is because the oral mucosa is usually light pink due to the underlying blood vessels and the thinness of the epithelium. \n\nThe mucogingival junction is the line of demarcation between the firm, resilient gingival tissue (which is light pink) and the softer, movable alveolar mucosa. \n\nTherefore, in a healthy mouth, the mucosa would be light pink on both sides of the mucogingival junction. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingigival junction.",
