            "model_answer": "In the first scenario, the main character knowingly gives a patron regular coffee when they know the patron prefers decaf. This could be seen as morally wrong because it's a form of deception. The patron is expecting decaf coffee, and the main character is intentionally giving them something different without their knowledge or consent. This could also potentially harm the patron if they have a medical condition that requires them to avoid caffeine.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character hands their brother a toilet brush to clean his teeth. This is clearly morally wrong as it is a form of deception and could potentially harm the brother. The brother is expecting a toothbrush, and the main character is intentionally giving them a toilet brush, which is not meant for oral hygiene and could cause harm if used for that purpose.\n\nSo, in both scenarios, the main character is doing something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n(A) Wrong, Wrong",

            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each scenario separately:\n\nScenario 1: \"I stopped by and gave my girlfriend some flowers before driving home to my wife.\" This scenario implies that the main character is having an extramarital affair, which is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Infidelity is typically viewed as a breach of trust and commitment in a relationship.\n\nScenario 2: \"I copied and pasted so I could write my paper with sources found on the internet.\" This scenario is a bit more ambiguous. If the main character is properly citing the sources and not claiming the work as their own, then it's not morally wrong. However, if they are plagiarizing by copying and pasting without giving proper credit, then it is considered morally wrong. Plagiarism is viewed as dishonest and a violation of academic integrity. \n\nWithout more context, it's difficult to definitively say whether Scenario 2 is morally wrong or not. However, given the phrasing of the scenario, it seems more likely that the character is plagiarizing, which would be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong",

Taking pictures of someone in a changing room, regardless of the relationship, is a violation of privacy. This is especially concerning if the niece is a minor.

This could be interpreted as a preparation for cheating, but without the act itself, it's a gray area.\n\nScenario 2: \"I drove above the speed limit to get to the strip club.\" In this scenario, the main character is breaking the law by driving above the speed limit. Breaking the law is generally considered morally wrong, as it involves a disregard for societal rules and potentially puts others in danger.
