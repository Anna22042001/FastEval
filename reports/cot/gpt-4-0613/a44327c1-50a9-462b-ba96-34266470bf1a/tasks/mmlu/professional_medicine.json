The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",

            "model_answer": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine, causing inflammation and pain. It can lead to ankylosis, which is the fusion of the vertebrae, leading to a rigid spine. The exact cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, but it's thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. \n\nThe first line of treatment for ankylosing spondylitis is usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can help to reduce inflammation and pain. However, in this case, the patient has not responded to NSAIDs or to sulfasalazine, which is a type of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that can be used to treat inflammatory conditions like ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nWhen first-line treatments are ineffective, the next step is often to try a biologic medication. Biologics are a type of DMARD that work by targeting specific parts of the immune system that are involved in the inflammatory process. \n\nOne of the key players in the inflammation process in ankylosing spondylitis is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine, a type of protein that the immune system uses to communicate. It's involved in systemic inflammation and is one of the cytokines that make up the acute phase reaction. \n\nInhibitors of TNF-\u03b1, known as TNF inhibitors or anti-TNF drugs, can be very effective in treating ankylosing spondylitis. They work by blocking the action of TNF-\u03b1, reducing inflammation and helping to control symptoms.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient would be administration of a drug that inhibits tumor necrosis factor \u03b1.\n\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",

Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the most appropriate legal term that represents the concept invoked by the patient in a malpractice suit where a surgical sponge was left in her pelvis after a hysterectomy. \n\nThe term \"collateral estoppel\" (A) refers to a legal principle that bars parties from relitigating a previously decided issue. This is not applicable in this case as there is no mention of a previously decided issue.\n\n\"Proximate cause\" (B) refers to an event sufficiently related to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury. This could be applicable as the surgical sponge left in the patient could be deemed the cause of her chronic pelvic pain. However, there is a more specific term for this situation.\n\n\"Respondeat superior\" (D) is a legal doctrine which states that an employer is responsible for the actions of employees performed within the course of their employment. This could be applicable as the surgeon who performed the hysterectomy could be considered an employee of the hospital. However, this term does not specifically address the negligence of leaving a surgical sponge in the patient.\n\n\"Res ipsa loquitur\" (C) is a Latin phrase that means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" In legal terms, it refers to situations where negligence is presumed because the incident could not have occurred without negligence. This is the most appropriate term for this situation as the surgical sponge could not have been left in the patient's pelvis without negligence.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is res ipsa loquitur.\n\n(C) res ipsa loquitur",

            "model_answer": "The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, along with her low body weight and high achievement in school and sports, raise the suspicion of an eating disorder. Eating disorders are common in adolescent girls and can present with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's request for a laxative also raises suspicion, as laxatives are often misused in eating disorders for weight control. Therefore, it would be important to obtain a menstrual history, as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) is a common feature of eating disorders due to the body's response to malnutrition. \n\n(A) While the color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements could provide some information about the patient's gastrointestinal health, it would not necessarily help confirm or rule out an eating disorder.\n(B) There is no indication in the scenario that the patient is at risk of sexually transmitted diseases.\n(C) While a family history of irritable bowel syndrome could potentially explain the patient's symptoms, it would not explain her low body weight or potential misuse of laxatives.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Menstrual history.",

When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia. Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion.

            "model_answer": "This patient's symptoms of lightheadedness upon standing, along with a decrease in blood pressure from supine to standing, are suggestive of orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of \u226520 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of \u226510 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing. This condition is common in the elderly due to age-related changes in blood pressure regulation, but it can also be caused by medications. \n\nIn this patient, her medications are likely contributing to her symptoms. She is on a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an ACE inhibitor, all of which can cause orthostatic hypotension. The diuretic can decrease blood volume, the \u03b2-blocker can decrease heart rate and contractility, and the ACE inhibitor can decrease peripheral vascular resistance. \n\nGiven this, the most appropriate next step in management would be to adjust her medication regimen. This could involve decreasing the dose of her current medications, switching to different medications, or adding a medication to treat orthostatic hypotension. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Adjusting her medication regimen.",
