            "model_answer": "General relativity, a theory proposed by Albert Einstein, describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It predicts several phenomena related to the behavior of light and time in the presence of massive objects like the Sun.\n\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity. This is a common misconception. In fact, the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference according to Einstein's theory of relativity. However, the path that light takes can be curved by gravity, which can make it appear as if light is \"slowed\" when it is actually just taking a longer path.\n\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected. This is true. General relativity predicts that the path of light will be curved in the presence of a massive object. This phenomenon is known as gravitational lensing and has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations.\n\n(C) A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth. This is actually the opposite of what general relativity predicts. According to the theory, the presence of a massive object slows down time. This is known as gravitational time dilation. So a clock on the Sun's surface would actually run slower than a clock on Earth, not faster.\n\nSo, only one of these statements is correct according to the predictions of general relativity.\n\n(D) All of these.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) light passing the Sun is deflected.",

            "model_answer": "A galvanometer is an instrument used for detecting and measuring small amounts of current in an electrical circuit. It can be calibrated to read the current by measuring the deflection caused by the current in a magnetic field.\n\nHowever, a galvanometer can also be converted into a voltmeter to measure voltage. This is done by connecting a high resistance in series with the galvanometer. The voltage is then proportional to the current, allowing the galvanometer to measure voltage.\n\nTherefore, a galvanometer can be calibrated to read either current or voltage.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Either of these",

The electron and the antineutrino are emitted from the nucleus as the beta particle. \n\nSince a neutron is converted into a proton, the number of protons in the nucleus increases by one.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking what is created in a closed loop of wire when the magnetic field is changed. This is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, specifically Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction.\n\nFaraday's Law states that a change in the magnetic field within a closed loop of wire induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the wire. An electromotive force is essentially a voltage, so we can say that a change in the magnetic field induces a voltage in the wire.\n\nThis induced voltage, or EMF, will cause electrons in the wire to move, creating an electric current. So, we can also say that a change in the magnetic field induces a current in the wire.\n\nThe movement of these electrons, or the current, creates an electric field. So, we can also say that a change in the magnetic field induces an electric field in the wire.\n\nTherefore, a change in the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire creates a voltage, a current, and an electric field. \n\nSo, the answer is (D) All of these.",

This creates a pressure wave that moves outwards and causes a loud noise when it reaches an observer, which is the sonic boom.\n\nOption (A) \"breaking the sound barrier\" refers to the moment an aircraft accelerates to a speed faster than sound. This indeed produces a sonic boom.\n\nOption (B) \"pulling out of a subsonic dive\" refers to an aircraft slowing down from a speed faster than sound to a speed slower than sound. This does not necessarily produce a sonic boom. A sonic boom is produced when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, not when it slows down from it.\n\nOption (C) \"flying faster than sound\" is the condition under which a sonic boom is produced. As long as the aircraft maintains a speed faster than sound, it will continue to produce a sonic boom.\n\nOption (D) \"Each of these produces a sonic boom\" is not correct because, as explained above, pulling out of a subsonic dive does not necessarily produce a sonic boom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) flying faster than sound.",

            "model_answer": "A barometer is a scientific instrument used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure. The traditional mercury barometer consists of a glass tube, closed at one end, filled with mercury and inverted into a dish of mercury. The height of the mercury column is proportional to the atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe reason mercury is used in barometers is because it is much denser than most other liquids. This means that a given pressure will cause a relatively small change in the height of the mercury column, making the barometer more compact and easier to read.\n\nIf we were to use water instead of mercury in a barometer, the barometer would have to be much taller. This is because water is less dense than mercury, so a given pressure would cause a much larger change in the height of the water column. \n\nTherefore, a barometer that uses water instead of mercury will be taller.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) taller.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the concept of satellites in circular Earth orbit. Satellites in orbit around the Earth are not in a zero-gravity environment. In fact, the force of gravity is what keeps them in orbit. If there were no gravity, the satellite would move in a straight line off into space.\n\nOption (A) and (B) suggest that the gravitational force on the satellites is zero or practically zero. This is incorrect because, as mentioned above, gravity is what keeps the satellites in orbit. Without gravity, the satellites would not stay in orbit.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the gravitational force on the satellites is appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface. While it's true that the force of gravity decreases as you move away from the Earth, it's not appreciably weaker. The force of gravity at the altitude of most satellites is still quite strong - about 90% as strong as at the Earth's surface.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the gravitational force on the satellites is without a component of force along their circular path. This is correct. The force of gravity acts as a centripetal force, pulling the satellite towards the Earth. This force is always directed towards the center of the Earth, which is at a right angle to the direction of the satellite's motion. Therefore, there is no component of the gravitational force that is along the direction of the satellite's motion. This is why the satellite maintains a constant speed - there are no forces acting to speed it up or slow it down.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) without a component of force along their circular path.",
