            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the natural resources that each of these countries has. Natural resources are crucial for modern industry as they provide the raw materials needed for manufacturing and production. These resources include things like minerals, fossil fuels, and forests.\n\n(A) The United States is known for its vast natural resources. It has large reserves of coal, natural gas, and oil. It also has significant amounts of copper, gold, and other minerals. Additionally, it has large areas of fertile land for agriculture.\n\n(B) Japan, on the other hand, is a small island nation with limited natural resources. It has some coal and a small amount of oil and natural gas, but it relies heavily on imports for most of its energy needs. It also lacks significant mineral resources.\n\n(C) France has moderate natural resources. It has some coal, oil, and natural gas, but not as much as the United States. It also has some mineral resources, including iron ore and bauxite.\n\n(D) The United Kingdom has significant coal reserves and some oil and natural gas, particularly in the North Sea. It also has some mineral resources.\n\nBased on this information, it seems that Japan is the least self-sufficient in terms of the natural resources needed for modern industry. It has the fewest natural resources of the four countries listed and relies heavily on imports for its energy needs.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) Japan.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process of how a new fashion design is introduced globally can be understood through the lens of cultural geography, which studies how ideas, practices, and goods spread from one place to another. \n\n(A) Contagious diffusion refers to the rapid and widespread dispersion of a characteristic throughout the population. This typically happens after the initial introduction and acceptance of the new trend.\n\n(B) Relocation diffusion happens when people move from their original location to another, bringing their ideas, innovations, and other cultural practices with them. This is not typically how fashion trends spread on a global scale.\n\n(C) Innovative diffusion is not a recognized term in cultural geography or fashion industry. It seems to be a mix-up of terms.\n\n(D) Hierarchical diffusion is a type of diffusion in which an idea or innovation spreads by trickling down from larger to smaller adoption units. In the context of fashion, a new design or trend often starts with high-end designers and celebrities, then spreads to the general public. This is often how new fashion designs are introduced globally.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) hierarchical diffusion.",

            "model_answer": "Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is a concept in economic theory that explains how advantages or disadvantages in an economy can reinforce themselves over time. This theory is often used to explain the persistent gap between rich and poor regions or countries.\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade. This statement is not part of Myrdal's theory. According to his theory, the wealthier regions or countries tend to benefit more from trade than the poorer ones, because they have more resources and capabilities to exploit the opportunities that trade offers.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery. This statement is part of Myrdal's theory. The \"core\" refers to the wealthier regions or countries, and the \"periphery\" refers to the poorer ones. According to his theory, the core tends to dominate the periphery because it has more resources and capabilities.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery. This statement is part of Myrdal's theory. According to his theory, the wealthier regions or countries tend to grow and prosper at the expense of the poorer ones, because they are able to attract more resources and opportunities.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade. This statement is part of Myrdal's theory. According to his theory, regions or countries that start with an advantage tend to keep and expand it over time, because they are able to attract more resources and opportunities.\n\nSo, the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is (A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade. \n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what a world city is. A world city, also known as a global city, is a city that is a primary node in the global economic network. They are important centers for finance, trade, culture, politics and more. \n\n(A) World cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations. This is true. World cities are often the home of large corporations and businesses, which contribute to their global influence.\n\n(B) World cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities. This is also true. World cities have strong connections with other cities, both primary and secondary, through various networks such as trade, transportation, communication, and more.\n\n(C) World cities contain many offices of multinational organizations. This is true as well. World cities are hubs for multinational organizations and institutions, which often have offices or headquarters in these cities.\n\n(D) World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres. This is not true. World cities are found all over the globe, not just in the northern and western hemispheres. For example, Tokyo in Japan, Sydney in Australia, and Johannesburg in South Africa are all considered world cities, and they are located in the eastern and southern hemispheres.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres.",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the term that describes the concentration of production activities and people in a specific area for the benefit of everyone. \n\n(A) The substitution principle is an economic concept that suggests that people will start using a different product or service when the cost of the one they usually use becomes too high. This doesn't fit the definition given in the question.\n\n(B) Deglomeration is the dispersal of an industry that was formerly located in a single concentrated area. This is the opposite of what the question is asking for.\n\n(C) Agglomeration refers to the phenomenon of economic activity congregating in or close to a single location, rather than being spread out uniformly across space. This fits the definition given in the question.\n\n(D) Infrastructure refers to the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.
