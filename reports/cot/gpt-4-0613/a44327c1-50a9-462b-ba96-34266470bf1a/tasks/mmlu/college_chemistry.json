            "model_answer": "Optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism. This kind of isomerism occurs when the molecules are mirror images of each other, but cannot be superimposed. This is also known as chirality. \n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is incorrect. Square planar complexes do not exhibit optical isomerism, regardless of whether the ligands are identical or not. This is because they are symmetric and any mirror image can be superimposed on the original.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is incorrect. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism, but only if all four ligands are different.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is incorrect. Linear complexes cannot display optical isomerism, regardless of whether the ligands are identical or different. This is because they are symmetric and any mirror image can be superimposed on the original.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is correct. Octahedral complexes can display optical isomerism, but only when they have at least three different ligands.

The azimuthal quantum number (l) determines the shape of the orbital and can be any integer from 0 to n-1. The magnetic quantum number (m) determines the orientation of the orbital and can be any integer from -l to +l. The spin quantum number (s) determines the direction of the electron's spin and can be either +1/2 or -1/2.\n\nHowever, for a nuclide like 55Mn, the number of allowed energy levels is not determined by these quantum numbers. Instead, it is determined by the nuclear structure and the interactions between the protons and neutrons in the nucleus. \n\nThe 55Mn nuclide has 25 protons and 30 neutrons. The number of energy levels in a nucleus is typically given by the formula 2n+1, where n is the number of unpaired nucleons (protons or neutrons). \n\nIn the case of 55Mn, all the protons are paired, but there is one unpaired neutron.

This is a question about nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, a technique used to determine the structure of organic compounds.\n\nIn NMR spectroscopy, the chemical shift of a proton (1H) is measured relative to the chemical shift of TMS, which is defined as 0 ppm. The chemical shift depends on the electronic environment of the proton, which is influenced by the electronegativity of the atoms attached to the carbon atom to which the proton is bonded.\n\nThe compounds given as options are all methyl halides, CH3X, where X is a halogen atom. The halogen atoms differ in their electronegativity, with fluorine being the most electronegative and iodine being the least electronegative. The more electronegative the halogen atom, the more it will pull electron density away from the methyl group, causing the protons in the methyl group to be more deshielded and have a higher chemical shift.\n\nThe chemical shift in Hz can be calculated from the chemical shift in ppm using the equation \u0394\u03bd = \u03b4 * \u03bd0, where \u0394\u03bd is the chemical shift in Hz, \u03b4 is the chemical shift in ppm, and \u03bd0 is the operating frequency of the spectrometer in MHz. The operating frequency of the spectrometer can be calculated from the strength of the magnet using the equation \u03bd0 = \u03b3 * B0, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton (42.58 MHz/T) and B0 is the strength of the magnet in T.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the operating frequency of the spectrometer: \u03bd0 = \u03b3 * B0 = 42.58 MHz/T * 12.0 T = 510.96 MHz.\n\nNext, we can calculate the chemical shift in ppm that corresponds to a chemical shift of 1.55 kHz: \u03b4 = \u0394\u03bd / \u03bd0 = 1.55 kHz / 510.96 MHz = 0.003 ppm.\n\nThis is a very small chemical shift, which suggests that the halogen atom in the compound is not very electronegative.
