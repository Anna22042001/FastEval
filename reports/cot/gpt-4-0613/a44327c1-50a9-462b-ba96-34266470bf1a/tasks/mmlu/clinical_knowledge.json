            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking why blood continues to flow through the vessels even when the left ventricle of the heart is not contracting. \n\n(A) The atria contracting would not cause blood to continue flowing through the vessels when the left ventricle is not contracting. The atria contract to push blood into the ventricles, not the vessels.\n\n(B) The vessels contracting would not cause blood to continue flowing. In fact, if the vessels were to contract, it would make it harder for blood to flow through them.\n\n(C) The right ventricle being relaxed would not cause blood to continue flowing through the vessels when the left ventricle is not contracting. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, not the rest of the body.\n\n(D) The arteries having elastic recoil would cause blood to continue flowing through the vessels when the left ventricle is not contracting. When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood into the arteries, which expand to accommodate the increased volume of blood. When the left ventricle relaxes, the arteries contract or \"recoil,\" which helps to push the blood forward through the vessels.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). \n\n(A) Ophthalmoplegia refers to paralysis or weakness of one or more of the muscles that control eye movement. While Graves' disease can cause eye problems, including inflammation, swelling, and bulging of the eyes (known as Graves' ophthalmopathy), it does not typically cause ophthalmoplegia.\n\n(B) Graves' disease can cause the thyroid gland to enlarge, a condition known as a goitre. However, the goitre associated with Graves' disease is typically diffuse and smooth, not multi-nodular.\n\n(C) Graves' disease is more common in women than in men. The ratio of women to men with Graves' disease is about 7:1.\n\n(D) 'Derbyshire Neck' is a term used to describe a large goitre that was common in certain areas of England where the soil was deficient in iodine. Graves' disease can cause a goitre, but it is not specifically associated with 'Derbyshire Neck'. This condition was more commonly caused by iodine deficiency, not Graves' disease.\n\nSo, none of the options A, B, and C are correct. The option D is partially correct but it does not fully describe the cause of 'Derbyshire Neck'. \n\nTherefore, none of the options fully and accurately describe Graves' disease.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Muscle contraction and relaxation is a complex process that involves several steps. The process begins when a nerve stimulus reaches the muscle fiber, triggering a series of events that lead to muscle contraction. This includes the release of calcium ions, which bind to proteins in the muscle fiber and uncover the actin binding sites. Myosin heads then bind to these sites, causing the muscle fiber to contract.\n\nWhen the nerve stimulus is removed, the process is reversed. Calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a structure within the muscle fiber. This causes the actin binding sites to be covered again, preventing the myosin heads from binding. As a result, the muscle fiber relaxes.\n\nTherefore, a muscle fiber relaxes when the nerve stimulus is removed. This is because the removal of the nerve stimulus triggers a series of events that lead to the relaxation of the muscle fiber.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. \n\n(A) A fall in the cell concentration of ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) is not a fundamental cause of fatigue. ADP is a product of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) breakdown, which provides energy for muscle contraction. If anything, a rise in ADP concentration might indicate that a lot of ATP has been used, but it's not the cause of fatigue.\n\n(B) Inhibition of ATP production could potentially cause fatigue, as ATP is the main source of energy for muscle contraction. However, this is not typically the primary cause of fatigue during high intensity exercise.\n\n(C) Failure of the ATP supply to match the demand is a more likely cause of fatigue. During high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP (for muscle contraction) is very high. If the body cannot produce ATP fast enough to meet this demand, fatigue can set in.\n\n(D) Lack of skill is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. While it's true that better technique can make exercise more efficient (and therefore less tiring), this is not a fundamental cause of fatigue.\n\nSo, the most likely answer is (C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. This is because ATP is the main source of energy for muscle contraction, and during high intensity exercise, the demand for ATP is very high. If the body cannot produce ATP fast enough to meet this demand, fatigue can set in.\n\n(C)",

            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what each of these processes is and what role oxygen might play in them.\n\n(A) Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is broken down into pyruvate, producing ATP (energy) in the process. This process does not directly use oxygen, but it does produce NADH, which can be used in the electron transport chain (a process that does use oxygen) to produce more ATP.\n\n(B) The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA is a process known as beta-oxidation. This process does not directly use oxygen. However, the acetyl CoA produced can enter the Krebs cycle, which indirectly involves oxygen in the later stages of cellular respiration.\n\n(C) The tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle, is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy. This process does not directly use oxygen, but the products of the Krebs cycle (NADH and FADH2) are used in the electron transport chain, which does use oxygen.\n\n(D) Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose. This process does not require oxygen.\n\nSo, none of these processes directly use oxygen. However, the products of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are used in the electron transport chain, which does use oxygen.

            "model_answer": "The development of fatigue is a complex process that involves multiple systems in the body, including the nervous system. Neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that transmit signals in the brain, play a key role in this process. \n\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in muscle activation and movement, among other things. Noradrenaline, also known as norepinephrine, is a neurotransmitter that is involved in the body's stress response. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that alterations in these neurotransmitters directly influence fatigue development.\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in motivation, reward, and motor control. There is evidence to suggest that alterations in dopamine can influence fatigue development. For example, conditions such as Parkinson's disease, which are characterized by dopamine deficiency, often have fatigue as a symptom.\n\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter that is involved in mood regulation, among other things. There is evidence to suggest that alterations in serotonin can influence fatigue development. For example, conditions such as depression, which are characterized by alterations in serotonin, often have fatigue as a symptom.\n\nGlutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it's involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory. However, its direct role in fatigue development is not as well-established as that of dopamine and serotonin.\n\nTherefore, based on the current understanding of the role of neurotransmitters in fatigue development, the most likely answer is that alterations in dopamine and serotonin can influence fatigue development.\n\n(D) Dopamine and serotonin.",

However, these initial signs may not always be immediately visible, especially in individuals with darker skin tones. \n\nIn more severe cases, it may take a few days for the full extent of the damage to become apparent. This is because pressure ulcers can sometimes develop under the skin before they become visible on the surface. \n\nGiven the options provided, the shortest time frame given is 12 hours, which is within the 2-6 hour range and also allows for any potential delay in the visibility of symptoms.
