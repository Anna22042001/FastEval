            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The concept of international legal personality refers to the capacity of an entity to be recognized and to operate within the international legal system. Traditionally, States and international organizations are the primary subjects of international law, meaning they have full international legal personality. They can enter into treaties, bring claims before international courts, and are bound by international law.\n\nIndividuals, on the other hand, have historically been seen as objects rather than subjects of international law. This means that they were considered to be governed by international law, but did not have the ability to participate directly in its creation or enforcement. However, this traditional view has evolved over time.\n\nIn the modern era, individuals have been increasingly recognized as having some degree of international legal personality. For example, individuals can be held accountable for violations of international law, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity, and can bring claims before certain international courts and tribunals. This is evident in the establishment of the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes individuals for serious crimes of international concern.\n\nHowever, the international legal personality of individuals is not as extensive as that of States and international organizations. Individuals cannot, for example, enter into treaties or engage in diplomatic relations. Therefore, while individuals do have some degree of international legal personality, it is limited compared to that of States and international organizations.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Collective rights refer to the rights that are held by a group, rather than by its individual members. These rights are typically associated with groups that have a distinct cultural, ethnic, or other identity that is different from the majority of the population. \n\nOption (A) suggests that collective rights belong to distinct groups of people. This is true, but it does not fully capture the meaning of collective rights, as it does not specify that these rights are held by the group as a whole, rather than by its individual members.\n\nOption (B) states that collective rights are those that belong to particular groups as opposed to the individual members of the group. This is a more accurate definition, as it emphasizes the collective nature of these rights.\n\nOption (C) suggests that minority rights are collective rights. While it is true that minority groups often have collective rights, this statement is not a definition of collective rights. Not all collective rights are minority rights, and not all minority rights are collective rights.\n\nOption (D) suggests that collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members. This is not accurate, as collective rights are held by the group as a whole, not by its individual members.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate definition of collective rights is given by option (B). \n\n(B)",

            "model_answer": "Monism is a philosophical and theoretical stance that posits a unity or singularity in a particular field of inquiry. In the context of law, monism is a theory that sees international and domestic law not as two separate systems but as a unified whole. This means that international and domestic law are not seen as distinct, separate entities but rather as parts of the same legal order. Therefore, the fundamental premise of monist theory is not about the superiority of one over the other, nor about the absence of conflict between the two.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order.",

This means that the Court's interpretation of the Convention's provisions can change over time to reflect societal changes and advancements.\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978) was a landmark case that established the right of prisoners to access a court, but it does not specifically illustrate the 'living instrument principle'.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009) was a case about the rights of children and corporal punishment. While it was an important case, it does not best illustrate the 'living instrument principle'.\n\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002) is a case that best illustrates the 'living instrument principle'. In this case, the Court ruled in favor of a transgender woman, recognizing her identity and right to marry in her affirmed gender. This was a significant departure from previous rulings and reflected changing societal attitudes towards transgender rights.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998) was a case about the state's obligation to protect life.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation is a principle in international law that states that treaties and international agreements automatically become part of the domestic law of a state once they have been ratified. This means that once a treaty is ratified, it is as if it has been incorporated into the domestic law of the state, without the need for any further legislative action. \n\nThis principle is in contrast to the doctrine of transformation, which requires that treaties be transformed into domestic law through the enactment of legislation before they can have any legal effect within the state. \n\nTherefore, the doctrine of incorporation does not require that all treaties undergo legislative transformation before they become domestic law, which rules out option (A). It also does not treat treaties as inferior to domestic law, which rules out option (C). \n\nInstead, the doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law, which aligns with option (D). However, before confirming this as the answer, let's evaluate option (B) as well. \n\nOption (B) states that the doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level. This is partially true, as the doctrine of incorporation does not require legislative transformation of treaties into domestic law. However, this statement could be misleading, as it might suggest that no action whatsoever is required at the domestic level, which is not accurate. Ratification of a treaty, which is a domestic action, is required for the doctrine of incorporation to apply. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement about what the doctrine of incorporation suggests in respect of treaties is option (D).\n\n(D) The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law.",

This includes having rights and obligations under international law, and the ability to bring a claim or be brought to account under international law.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because not only States, but also other entities like international organizations and individuals can have international legal personality.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because having international legal personality does not necessarily mean that an entity can challenge the authority of States. It simply means that the entity has rights and obligations under international law.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because international legal personality is not just about distinguishing between legal and physical persons. It's about the capacity to participate in the international legal system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.

            "model_answer": "The Kadi judgment is a landmark case in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) that dealt with the relationship between international law, specifically United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions, and European Union law. The case involved Yassin Abdullah Kadi, a Saudi Arabian citizen, who was listed by the UNSC as associated with terrorism and had his assets frozen. Kadi challenged this in the ECJ, arguing that the implementation of the UNSC resolution in EU law violated his fundamental rights.\n\nThe ECJ ruled in favor of Kadi, stating that while the EU is obliged to respect international law, this obligation does not extend to the point of compromising the constitutional principles of the EU legal order, which includes respect for fundamental rights. This means that UNSC resolutions, when implemented in EU law, must be in accordance with human rights.\n\nTherefore, the Kadi judgment introduced a dimension where UNSC resolutions, when incorporated into EU law, must be construed in accordance with human rights. This does not mean that all UNSC resolutions must be incorporated without any further implementing legislation, nor does it mean that important UNSC resolutions must be transformed and not merely incorporated. It also does not claim that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights, but rather that their implementation in EU law must respect human rights.\n\n(A) The Kadi judgment demanded that UNSC resolutions are construed in accordance with human rights.",

This can occur when different legal regimes, such as foreign investment law and human rights law, develop their own rules and principles without considering the rules and principles of other areas of international law. This can lead to a situation where different rules of international law contradict each other, making it difficult to determine which rule should be applied in a particular situation.

It held that the concept of an armed attack refers to a single, large-scale act of aggression, not multiple smaller instances of armed force. The court stated that not all uses of force constitute an armed attack, and that there must be a certain level of intensity and scale for a use of force to be classified as an armed attack.\n\nTherefore, the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory in the Nicaragua case, showing that it is hostile to the idea that an armed attack may arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) In the Nicaragua case the ICJ dismissed the accumulation theory.",
