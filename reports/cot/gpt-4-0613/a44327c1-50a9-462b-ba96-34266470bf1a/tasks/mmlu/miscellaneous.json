            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to make some assumptions and calculations. \n\nFirst, let's consider the population of the United States. As of 2021, it's approximately 331 million people.\n\nNext, let's consider how often the average person watches a movie at home in a year. This can vary widely depending on the person, but let's assume that the average person watches a movie at home once a week. This is a rough estimate and could be higher or lower depending on the individual.\n\nSo, if each person watches a movie at home once a week, that's 52 movies per person per year.\n\nNow, we multiply the number of movies watched per person per year by the total population:\n\n52 movies/person/year * 331,000,000 people = 17,212,000,000 movies/year\n\nThis number is closest to option (C) 20,000,000,000.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 20,000,000,000.",

It doesn't involve any comparison between two or more quantities.\n\n(B) Having students put one apple in the middle of the place mat on their desks - This task doesn't involve any comparison of quantities. It's more about placement and possibly counting if there's more than one apple.\n\n(C) Having students make a Venn diagram for the color of the apples - This task is more about categorization and understanding the concept of sets and intersections. It doesn't directly involve comparing quantities.\n\n(D) Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal - This task involves comparing two quantities: the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples. The students would need to count each group of apples and then compare the two numbers to determine if they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the task that is best targeted at teaching students to compare quantities is (D) Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal. \n\n(D)",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we would need to make several assumptions and calculations. \n\n1. First, we need to estimate how much ice is thrown away by Americans each day. Let's assume that every American has one iced drink per day, and each drink contains about 30 grams of ice that is not consumed. \n\n2. The population of the United States is approximately 330 million people. So, the total amount of ice thrown away each day is 30 grams/person * 330 million people = 9.9 billion grams or 9.9 million kilograms.\n\n3. Next, we need to calculate the energy wasted in cooling this ice from room temperature to freezing point and then freezing it. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.18 J/g\u00b0C and the heat of fusion of water is 334 J/g. \n\n4. Let's assume the room temperature to be 25\u00b0C. So, the energy required to cool the water to 0\u00b0C is (25\u00b0C * 4.18 J/g\u00b0C * 9.9 billion g) = 1.03 trillion J.\n\n5. The energy required to freeze the water is (334 J/g * 9.9 billion g) = 3.3 trillion J.\n\n6. So, the total energy wasted each day is (1.03 trillion J + 3.3 trillion J) = 4.33 trillion J.\n\n7. Over a year, this amounts to (4.33 trillion J/day * 365 days/year) = 1.58 quadrillion J.\n\nNone of the options provided match this calculation.
