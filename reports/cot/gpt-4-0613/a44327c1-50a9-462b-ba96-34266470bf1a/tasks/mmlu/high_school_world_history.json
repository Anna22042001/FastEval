It mentions that the copper is mined in a town called ZKRY and then transported to BYTY, where it is sold for gold. The gold is then extracted from its deposits by pagan nations within the kingdom. This suggests that there were established trade connections during this period, as the copper and gold had to be transported and traded between different locations. \n\nHowever, the passage does not provide any information about religions being spread through warfare, diseases spreading along trade routes, or nomadic migrations creating powerful empires.
