            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what each of these terms mean:\n\n(A) Arboreal refers to animals that live in trees. It has nothing to do with facial features.\n\n(B) Prognathous refers to the condition of having a projecting lower jaw or chin. This term is often used in anthropology, dentistry, and related fields.\n\n(C) Diastema refers to a gap or space between two teeth. This term is commonly used in dentistry.\n\n(D) Mandible refers to the lower jaw or jawbone in both vertebrates and invertebrates. It's a specific bone, not a description of a facial feature.\n\nGiven these definitions, the term that refers to having a forward-thrusting lower face is prognathous.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) prognathous.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Levallois technology is a name given by archaeologists to a distinctive type of stone knapping developed by precursors to modern humans during the Palaeolithic period. It is named after 19th-century finds of flint tools in the Levallois-Perret suburb of Paris, France. The technique was more sophisticated than earlier methods of lithic reduction, involving the striking of flakes from a prepared core. \n\nThis technology is not related to the production of pottery or clothing, so we can eliminate option (B). It also does not specifically involve the production of arrows or spear points, so option (C) is not correct. While the Levallois technique did result in the production of sharper tools, it was not specifically a shift from larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones, so option (D) is not the best answer.\n\nThe Levallois technique involved a shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes. The core was prepared in a way that allowed the removal of flakes from it, which could then be used as tools. This is a significant shift in emphasis from the production of core tools to the production of flakes, which is what option (A) describes.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) producing core tools to producing flakes.",

This field does not focus on living relatives of humans.\n\n(C) Primatology is the scientific study of primates. Primates include humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians, or lower primates. This field is the most likely answer as it focuses on living relatives of humans.\n\n(D) Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure.

The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest building in Teotihuac\u00e1n and one of the largest in Mesoamerica.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the archaeological evidence and historical records about the domestication of cattle. \n\nThe domestication of cattle is believed to have taken place in the Near East, which is a region that roughly corresponds to the modern Middle East. This includes countries like Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. The process of domestication involved humans selecting and breeding animals with desirable traits over many generations.\n\nThe timeline for this process is estimated to be around 10,500 years ago. This is based on archaeological evidence such as remains of domesticated cattle found in ancient settlements, as well as genetic studies that trace the lineage of modern cattle back to a small herd of wild aurochs in this region and time period.\n\nComparing this information with the options given, we can see that option (D) \"in the Middle East, about 10,500 years ago\" matches the historical and archaeological evidence about where and when cattle were first domesticated.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) in the Middle East, about 10,500 years ago.",

It is named after a flower, Dryas octopetala, that flourished in the cold conditions of this period. \n\nOption (A) suggests that the Younger Dryas was a warming period at the end of the Pleistocene. However, the Younger Dryas is actually known for a sudden and dramatic cooling period, not a warming one. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the Younger Dryas was a period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago. This is accurate. The Younger Dryas is known for a sudden return to glacial conditions, which is often referred to as a \"cold snap\". This period is generally agreed to have occurred approximately 12,900 to 11,600 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the Holocene epoch.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the Younger Dryas was a period of glacial retreat between 10,900 and 9,000 years ago. This is not accurate. The Younger Dryas was a period of glacial expansion, not retreat. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption (D) suggests that the Younger Dryas was a period of environmental change that caused humans to temporarily abandon much of northern Europe. While it's true that the Younger Dryas was a period of significant environmental change, and it likely had impacts on human populations, it's not specifically defined by human migration patterns. So, this option is not the most accurate.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most accurate answer is (B) a period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago.\n\n(B)",

However, religious institutions were a significant part of society, often serving as centers of learning, administration, and economic activity.\n\nBefore the advent of social complexity, the temple was the institution that was set apart and had powers in Mesopotamian society. Temples were not just places of worship, but also served as administrative centers and repositories of wealth.

This seems less likely to be the hypothesis of the research mentioned in the question, as it would be difficult to prove with brain imaging and stone tool replication alone.\n\nOption C suggests that tool making originated millions of years after language evolved.
