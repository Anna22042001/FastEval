These hymns are considered the core texts of the Zoroastrian liturgy. They are often recited during religious ceremonies and are considered sacred by Zoroastrians.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The term \"janam-sakhis\" is derived from the Punjabi language, where \"janam\" means birth and \"sakhi\" means story or narrative. Therefore, the term \"janam-sakhis\" refers to the genre of Sikh literature that narrates the birth and life stories of the Sikh Gurus, particularly Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism. \n\nThese narratives are not just about the physical birth, but also about the spiritual journey, teachings, miracles, and significant events in the life of the Gurus. They are a significant source of Sikh history and tradition, providing insights into the socio-cultural context of the time. \n\nHowever, when we look at the options provided, we need to choose the one that best fits the description of janam-sakhis. While they do contain spiritual and theological elements, their primary focus is on the life and birth stories of the Sikh Gurus. \n\nTherefore, the most accurate genre of Sikh literature denoted by the term janam-sakhis would be \"Birth narratives\".\n\n(C) Birth narratives",

Mahavira is the 24th and last Tirthankara (spiritual teacher) in Jainism, while Rsabha, also known as Adinatha, is considered the first Tirthankara. \n\nSince the question asks about the origin of sacred literature, it would be logical to associate it with the first Tirthankara, who is believed to have laid down the fundamental principles of Jainism that were later compiled into sacred texts.\n\nSo, the sacred literature originated with Rsabha.\n\n(C) Rsabha",

Transcendent means that he is beyond the physical world and its limitations, while immanent means that he is present and active within the world. \n\nThe hymn does not focus on Marduk's wrath, judgment, or vengeance, nor does it emphasize his love and forgiveness.

            "correct_answer": 3,

The list is of immense value because it reflects very old traditions while at the same time providing an important chronological framework relating to the different periods of kingship in Sumeria.\n\nThe Sumerian King List begins with the very origin of kingship, which is described as having descended from heaven. The concept of kingship descending from heaven implies that the power and right to rule is granted by a divine source. This is a common theme in many ancient cultures where the king or ruler is seen as either divine themselves, or as chosen by the divine to lead.\n\nTherefore, according to the Sumerian King List, kingship comes from heaven.\n\n(D) Descends from heaven",
