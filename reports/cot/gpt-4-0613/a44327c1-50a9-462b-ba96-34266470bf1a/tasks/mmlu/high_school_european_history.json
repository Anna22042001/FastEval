He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" can be seen as a reflection of the Enlightenment belief that\n\n(A) society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it\n(B) a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature\n(C) the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property\n(D) only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness",

            "model_answer": "The Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and philosophical development in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was characterized by a focus on reason, science, and skepticism of traditional authority. \n\nCandide's statement that \"everything always happens for the best\" reflects the Enlightenment belief in rationalism and optimism. This belief is closely associated with the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who is mentioned in the passage. Leibniz argued that our world is the best of all possible worlds, a view that is often interpreted as a form of philosophical optimism.\n\nOption (A) suggests that society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it. This is a reflection of the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and science, but it doesn't directly relate to Candide's statement about everything happening for the best.\n\nOption (B) suggests that a people without a strong central authority are doomed to live in a state of nature. This is more related to the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes than to the philosophical optimism expressed by Candide.\n\nOption (C) suggests that the only purpose of a government is to secure the rights of life, liberty, and property. This is a reflection of the political philosophy of John Locke, another Enlightenment thinker, but it doesn't directly relate to Candide's statement.\n\nOption (D) suggests that only free markets can lead nations to wealth and happiness. This is a reflection of the economic philosophy of Adam Smith, yet another Enlightenment thinker, but it doesn't directly relate to Candide's statement.\n\nTherefore, none of the options perfectly capture the philosophical optimism expressed by Candide's statement. However, option (A) comes closest, as it reflects the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and science, which underpin Leibniz's argument that our world is the best of all possible worlds.\n\n(A) society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it",

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\n\n(A) observation and induction\n(B) ancient textual authority\n(C) experimentation\n(D) deduction from first principles",
