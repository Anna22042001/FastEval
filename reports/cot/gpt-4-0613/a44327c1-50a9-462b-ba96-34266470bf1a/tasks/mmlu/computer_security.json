            "model_answer": "Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a \"map\" of the network. To accomplish its goal, Nmap sends specially crafted packets to the target host(s) and then analyzes the responses.\n\nOption (A) describes this process accurately. Nmap works by injecting packets to a range of addresses, and inferring what hosts and services might be at those addresses, based on the responses.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because Nmap is not a network fuzz testing tool. Fuzz testing or fuzzing is a software testing technique used to discover coding errors and security loopholes in software, operating systems or networks by inputting massive amounts of random data, called fuzz, to the system in an attempt to make it crash.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because Nmap is not a map of the Internet. It is a tool used for network discovery and security auditing.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because Nmap is not a suite of tools for scripting attacks. While it can be used to probe networks and potentially identify vulnerabilities, its primary purpose is network discovery and security auditing, not launching attacks.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) It is a scanner which works by injecting packets to a range of addresses, and inferring what hosts and services might be at those addresses, based on the responses. \n\n(A)",

            "question": "What is the difference between a direct leak and a side channel?\n\n(A) A direct leak creates a denial of service by failing to free memory, while a channel frees memory as a side effect\n(B) A direct leak is one that is intentional, rather than by unintentional\n(C) A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, where as a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage\n(D) There is no difference",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "A direct leak and a side channel leak are both ways in which information can be unintentionally exposed in a system. However, they differ in how this exposure occurs.\n\nA direct leak refers to a situation where information is exposed through the software system's intended interaction mechanism. This could be due to a flaw in the system's design or implementation that allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nOn the other hand, a side channel leak refers to a situation where information is exposed through measurements of other system features that are not directly related to the system's intended interaction mechanism. These features could include timing, power usage, or space usage. For example, by observing the power consumption of a device, an attacker might be able to infer what operations the device is performing and thus gain access to sensitive information.\n\nTherefore, the difference between a direct leak and a side channel leak lies in the way the information is exposed: a direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, whereas a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features.\n\n(C) A direct leak comes via the software system's intended interaction mechanism, where as a side channel leak comes from measurements of other system features, like timing, power usage, or space usage",

            "model_answer": "Buffer overflow attacks are a common type of cyber attack where an attacker overloads a system's buffer memory with more data than it can handle, causing it to crash or execute arbitrary code. \n\n(A) Love Bug was a computer worm that spread through email and file sharing. It was not a buffer overflow attack.\n(B) SQL Slammer was a computer worm that caused a denial of service on some Internet hosts and dramatically slowed down general Internet traffic. It exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's SQL Server and Desktop Engine database products, but it was not the first buffer overflow attack.\n(D) Code Red was a computer worm observed on the Internet. It exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft's IIS web server, but it was not the first buffer overflow attack.\n\n(C) Morris Worm was one of the first worms distributed via the Internet, and it was the first to gain significant mainstream media attention. It was written by Robert Tappan Morris and launched on November 2, 1988. The worm was able to propagate through a buffer overflow vulnerability in the fingerd network service, making it the first buffer overflow attack.\n\nSo, the first buffer overflow attack was the Morris Worm.\n\n(C) Morris Worm",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Buffer overflow is a common issue in C and C++ because these languages do not perform automatic bounds checking. This means that when data is written to a buffer, C and C++ do not check whether the buffer is large enough to hold the data. If the data is larger than the buffer, it will overflow into adjacent memory, potentially overwriting other data or causing the program to crash.\n\nThis is related to the way C and C++ handle arrays and pointers. In these languages, an array is essentially a pointer to the first element, and there is no built-in way to determine the size of the array from the pointer alone. This means that it's up to the programmer to ensure that they do not write more data to the array than it can hold.\n\nPredefined functions in C and C++ like strcpy, strcat, gets, etc., do not perform any boundary checks and simply copy data to the destination buffer. If the source data is larger than the destination buffer, a buffer overflow will occur.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "OKWS, or the OK Web Server, is a web server that is designed to be secure and efficient. It uses a design where each service runs in its own sandboxed environment, and communication between services and the main server process is done through passing file descriptors.\n\n1. If Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, services would not be able to get a TCP connection to the client web browser. This is because the main server process, which accepts incoming connections, would not be able to pass the file descriptor for the connection to the service. The service would therefore not be able to communicate with the client.\n\n2. However, it would still be possible for okd (the OKWS daemon) to run as a non-root user. This is because the ability to run as a non-root user does not depend on the ability to pass file descriptors between processes. Instead, it depends on the ability to drop privileges after binding to a privileged port, which is a separate feature of Unix.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) True, False.",

The attacker provides input that is longer than the buffer allocated on the stack for that input. This causes the extra data to overflow into adjacent memory on the stack.\n\n2. The adjacent memory may contain the return address of the current function, which is the address that the program will jump to when the function finishes executing.\n\n3. By carefully crafting the input, the attacker can overwrite the return address with the address of some code that they want to run. This could be code that is already in the program, or it could be code that was included in the input itself.\n\n4.
