            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The onset of labor is a complex process that involves a number of hormonal changes. \n\nFirst, let's consider option (A), hormones secreted by the mother's ovaries. While the ovaries do produce hormones that are important for pregnancy, they are not directly responsible for triggering the onset of labor. \n\nNext, let's consider option (B), hormones secreted by the mother's hypothalamus. The hypothalamus does play a role in regulating hormones during pregnancy, but it does not directly trigger the onset of labor.\n\nOption (C), hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland, is a more likely candidate. Towards the end of pregnancy, the fetus' adrenal gland produces a surge of a hormone called cortisol. This hormone signals the mother's body to begin the process of labor.\n\nFinally, option (D), the placenta and uterus secretion of prostaglandins, is also a key part of the process. Prostaglandins are hormones that help to ripen (or soften) the cervix and stimulate contractions. However, this is more of a response to the initial trigger rather than the trigger itself.\n\nSo, based on this information, the most accurate answer would be that the onset of labor is first triggered by hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland.\n\nAnswer: (C) hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about a theory that uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour. \n\n(A) Sociobiology is a field of biology that explains social behavior in terms of evolutionary advantages. It does not typically use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation.\"\n\n(B) Psychoanalytic theory, developed by Sigmund Freud, focuses on the influence of the unconscious mind on behavior. It does not typically use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation.\"\n\n(C) Script theory is a psychological theory which posits that human behaviour largely falls into patterns called \"scripts\" because they function analogously to the way a written script does, providing a program for action. It does not typically use terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation.\"\n\n(D) Social learning theory, on the other hand, is a theory of learning process and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others. It uses terms like \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain how people learn and adopt new behaviors.\n\nTherefore, the theory that uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behaviour is social learning theory.\n\n(D) social learning theory",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The process of shedding the inner lining of the uterus is a natural part of the menstrual cycle. \n\n(A) Menstruation is the process where the uterus sheds its lining, resulting in bleeding from the vagina. This usually happens once a month.\n\n(B) Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. It is not related to the shedding of the uterus lining.\n\n(C) The luteal phase is the second half of the menstrual cycle, after ovulation. It involves the release of hormones to prepare the uterus for pregnancy, but not the shedding of the uterus lining.\n\n(D) The follicular phase is the first half of the menstrual cycle, leading up to ovulation. It involves the growth and maturation of the egg in the ovary, but not the shedding of the uterus lining.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Menstruation.",

            "model_answer": "The environment for sperm passage is most hospitable when the conditions are most favorable for fertilization.

While this is an important part of the cycle, it is not the time when the conditions are most favorable for sperm passage.\n\n(C) Ovulation is the phase in the menstrual cycle when the egg is released from the ovary. This is the time when the conditions are most favorable for sperm passage and fertilization. The cervix produces more mucus which helps the sperm travel to the egg.\n\n(D) Menstruation is the phase in the menstrual cycle when the lining of the uterus is shed. This is not a hospitable time for sperm passage as the conditions are not favorable for fertilization.\n\nTherefore, the environment for sperm passage is most hospitable just at ovulation.\n\n(C) Ovulation",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Gonorrhea and chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are caused by bacteria. These bacteria can infect the mucous membranes of the body, which are found in certain parts of the body that are moist and soft.\n\nOption (A), the penis, is not the most accurate answer because it is too general. The penis is made up of several parts, including the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine and semen out of the body.\n\nOption (B), the scrotum, is not the most accurate answer because the scrotum is primarily involved in housing and protecting the testicles, rather than being a site of infection for these STIs.\n\nOption (D), the bladder, is not the most accurate answer because while these STIs can potentially spread to the bladder if left untreated, it is not the most common site of infection.\n\nOption (C), the urethra, is the most accurate answer. The urethra is a part of both the urinary and reproductive systems, making it a common site of infection for STIs like gonorrhea and chlamydia. These bacteria can easily infect the mucous membranes lining the urethra during sexual activity.\n\nSo, the most accurate answer is (C) urethra.",

            "model_answer": "Female sterilization, also known as tubal ligation, is a procedure where a woman's fallopian tubes are blocked, tied, or cut. This prevents the eggs from traveling from the ovaries into the uterus, where they could potentially be fertilized by sperm. \n\nHowever, this procedure does not affect the production of eggs themselves. The ovaries continue to produce and release eggs, but these eggs are simply not able to reach the uterus. \n\nSimilarly, female sterilization does not inhibit the production of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are still produced by the ovaries and continue to be released into the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) none of the above.",

It is generally accepted in most societies and is not considered illegal. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n(B) Incest: This is a sexual act between close relatives. In many societies, incest is considered taboo and is often illegal due to the potential for genetic issues in offspring and the potential for exploitation or abuse. Therefore, this option could potentially be the correct answer.\n\n(C) Sex during menstruation: This is a sexual act that occurs during a woman's menstrual cycle. While some cultures or religions may have taboos or restrictions around this, it is generally not illegal or universally prohibited in most societies. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\n(D) Sex with a non-spouse if the person is married: This is often referred to as adultery. While it may be considered morally wrong in many societies, it is not universally illegal or prohibited. Some societies may have laws against it, but others may not.

            "model_answer": "The saying \"opposites attract\" is a common belief that people with different personalities, attitudes, and backgrounds are more likely to be attracted to each other. However, when considering current research, we need to look at studies that have been conducted on this topic.\n\nResearch in the field of social psychology has consistently found that similarity is a strong predictor of attraction and relationship satisfaction. This is known as the similarity-attraction effect. People tend to be attracted to others who share similar attitudes, values, and beliefs. This is because similarity leads to validation of one's own beliefs and attitudes, reduces conflict, and facilitates smoother interactions.\n\nThis principle applies to various types of relationships, including friendships, romantic relationships, and even professional relationships. It is not limited to a specific gender or sexual orientation. Therefore, the saying \"opposites attract\" does not seem to hold true when considered in light of current research.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A) It does not seem to be true.",
