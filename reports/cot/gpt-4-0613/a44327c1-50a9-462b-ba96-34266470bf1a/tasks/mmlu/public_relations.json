However, without this information, it's impossible to definitively say which author emphasized strategy as achieving competitive advantage for an organization. \n\nIn general, the concept of using strategy to achieve competitive advantage is a common theme in business and management literature. It's likely that many authors have discussed this idea in their works. However, without specific information about the works of Steyn (2003), Gregory (2006), Cutlip et al (2006), and Henry (2006), we can't say for certain which one emphasized this idea.\n\nTherefore, without further information, we cannot provide an answer to this question.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The effectiveness of a form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue can vary depending on several factors such as the nature of the issue, the audience, the context, and the specific strategies used. However, we can analyze each option based on general principles of communication and persuasion.\n\n(A) Interpersonal communication can be very effective because it allows for a two-way exchange of ideas, immediate feedback, and personal connection. It can be particularly effective in changing predispositions if the communicator is trusted and respected by the other person.\n\n(B) Media communication can reach a large audience and can use a variety of strategies to persuade, such as appealing to emotions, presenting compelling evidence, or using influential figures to endorse a position. However, its effectiveness can be limited by factors such as media bias, selective exposure, and the lack of personal connection.\n\n(C) Group communication can be effective because it allows for the exchange of diverse perspectives and the potential for group norms to influence individual attitudes. However, it can also lead to groupthink, where the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an incorrect or poor decision.\n\n(D) Public communication, such as speeches or public debates, can be effective in shaping public opinion, especially if the communicator is a well-known and respected figure. However, its effectiveness can be limited by factors such as the audience's pre-existing attitudes and beliefs, the lack of personal connection, and the potential for the message to be misunderstood or distorted.\n\nBased on this analysis, it can be argued that interpersonal communication is generally the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, due to the potential for personal connection, immediate feedback, and the influence of trust and respect in the relationship.\n\nAnswer: (A) Interpersonal.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the type of publics that help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to understand the different types of publics as defined by Esman (1972). \n\n(A) Enabling publics are those that provide an organization with the necessary resources and authority to operate. They can include government bodies, regulatory agencies, and other organizations that have the power to grant or withhold necessary permissions or resources.\n\n(B) Functional publics are those that are directly involved in the operations of an organization. They can include employees, suppliers, and customers.\n\n(C) Normative publics are those that share similar values, goals, or problems with an organization. They can include other organizations in the same industry or sector.\n\n(D) Diffused publics are those that are not directly involved with an organization but may become involved in response to a particular issue or event. They can include the general public, media, and other stakeholders.\n\nGiven these definitions, the type of publics that help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance would be enabling publics. They provide the necessary resources and authority that an organization needs to operate.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Enabling.",

The first blank is looking for a term that means \"a well-informed public,\" and the second blank is looking for a term that means \"take the form of a dialogue.\"\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\n(A) \"Intelligentsia\" is a term used to describe a social class of people engaged in complex mental and creative labor directed to the development and dissemination of culture, encompassing intellectuals and social groups close to them. \"Democratic\" refers to a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. This option doesn't seem to fit because \"intelligentsia\" doesn't exactly mean \"a well-informed public,\" and \"democratic\" doesn't exactly mean \"take the form of a dialogue.\"\n\n(B) \"Democracy\" is a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. \"Dialogic\" refers to the concept of dialogue and dialogism, which is the idea that language is dialogical by nature and that meaning and understanding are developed through dialogue. This option seems to fit because \"democracy\" can be interpreted as \"a well-informed public,\" and \"dialogic\" means \"take the form of a dialogue.\"\n\n(C) \"Democracy\" is a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. \"Logical\" refers to reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity. This option doesn't seem to fit because \"logical\" doesn't mean \"take the form of a dialogue.\"\n\n(D) \"Democracy\" is a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives. \"Bipartisan\" refers to the agreement or cooperation of two political parties that usually oppose each other's policies. This option doesn't seem to fit because \"bipartisan\" doesn't mean \"take the form of a dialogue.\"\n\nSo, the best option seems to be (B) democracy, dialogic. \n\nAnswer: (B)",

This is where the broad goals of the program are established.\n\nPlanning the program involves deciding on the specific objectives that will help achieve the broad goals identified in the defining stage. This is where the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives are set.\n\nTaking action and implementing ideas involves carrying out the activities that have been planned in order to achieve the objectives.\n\nEvaluation of the program involves assessing whether the objectives have been achieved and whether the program has been successful.\n\nTherefore, the objectives are decided on in the stage of planning the program.\n\nAnswer: (B) Planning the program.",

            "model_answer": "The World Wide Web, often simply called the Web, was invented by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. He first proposed the system to his employer CERN, a European physics research center, as a way to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee had built the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and the first Web browser. However, it was not until August 1991 that the Web was opened to the public. \n\nSo, while the initial invention started in 1989, it was not made publicly available until 1991. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the question is asking for the year the Web was conceived (1989) or the year it was made available to the public (1991).\n\n(B) 1989",

This implies a shift from the early theories that viewed audiences as passive recipients, suggesting that audiences now actively interpret and respond to media messages in different ways.\n\n(D) This option suggests that technology has led to more passive recipients, which is similar to the early theories and doesn't represent a shift in thinking.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer would be the one that suggests a shift from the early theories of passive audiences to a current view of audiences as active receivers who interpret and respond to media messages in different ways.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.",

It is also not about creating an elite of public relations practitioners (B), as the goal is not to create a hierarchy within the profession but to ensure a minimum standard of competence. \n\nWhile licensing can lead to better wages for licensed practitioners (D), this is not the main purpose of licensing.
