            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we would need to look at the data provided by the United States Census Bureau or other reliable sources that provide such demographic information. \n\nAs of 2017, the United States Census Bureau reported that approximately 82.3% of the U.S. population lived in urban areas. This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of people living in urban areas by the total population and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 82%.",

            "model_answer": "The global fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in her lifetime. This rate varies greatly from country to country, but the global average can be found by taking the total number of births worldwide and dividing it by the total number of women of childbearing age.\n\nAs of 2015, the global fertility rate was not as high as 4.5 children per woman (option D) or 3.5 children per woman (option C). These rates are more typical of countries with very high fertility rates, but they are much higher than the global average.\n\nOn the other hand, the global fertility rate was also not as low as 1.5 children per woman (option A). This rate is more typical of countries with very low fertility rates, such as Japan and many European countries.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, the global fertility rate as of 2015 was about 2.5 children per woman (option B). This is consistent with data from the World Bank and other sources, which show a gradual decline in the global fertility rate over the past few decades, from about 5 children per woman in the 1960s to about 2.5 children per woman in 2015.\n\n(B) 2.5 children per woman",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we would need to refer to historical data or surveys conducted during that time period. The Iran-Contra affair was a significant political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration. It involved secret U.S. government sales of weapons to Iran, which was then engaged in a bloody war with its neighbor Iraq. The aim was to free seven American hostages held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties.\n\nThe scandal also involved the funding of the Contras in Nicaragua with the proceeds from the weapons sales, which was a direct violation of U.S. law. When the dealings came to light in November 1986, it led to investigations and caused a drop in President Reagan's popularity.\n\nHowever, without specific data or a reliable source, it's impossible to accurately determine what percentage of Americans believed Reagan was withholding information during the Iran-Contra affair in 1987. This information is not common knowledge and would require specific research or reference to a reliable source. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question.",

However, this figure includes children aged 5-17, not just those aged 5-14. \n\nTo find the number of children aged 5-14 who were working globally in 2012, we would need to look at a more specific breakdown of the data. According to the ILO's \"Marking Progress Against Child Labour\" report from 2013, children aged 5-14 accounted for approximately 88% of all child labourers in 2012.\n\nIf we apply this percentage to the total number of child labourers, we can estimate the number of children aged 5-14 who were working globally in 2012. \n\nSo, 88% of 168 million is approximately 148 million. \n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the number of children aged 5-14 who were working globally in 2012 is 150 million.\n\n(C) 150 million",
