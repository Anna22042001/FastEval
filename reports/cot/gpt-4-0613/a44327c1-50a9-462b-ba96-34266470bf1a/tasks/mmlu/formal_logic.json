            "model_answer": "The sentence \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\" is a universal statement, meaning it applies to all planets. Therefore, we can eliminate option (A) because it uses the existential quantifier (\u2203x), which would mean \"There exists a planet that is smaller than Jupiter\", not \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\".\n\nNext, we need to determine the correct order of the variables in the predicate Sxy, which stands for \"x is smaller than y\". In our sentence, \"x\" would be any planet and \"y\" would be Jupiter. Therefore, we want the order to be Sxj, meaning \"x (any planet) is smaller than Jupiter\". This eliminates option (C) because it has the order Sjx, which would mean \"Jupiter is smaller than x (any planet)\".\n\nFinally, we need to determine the correct logical connective. In this case, we want to say \"If x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter\". The logical connective for \"if...then\" is the conditional (\u2283), not the conjunction (\u2022). The conjunction would mean \"x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter\", which is not quite what we want to say. Therefore, we eliminate option (B).\n\nThis leaves us with option (D), which correctly translates the sentence \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\" into predicate logic.\n\n(D) (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj)",
