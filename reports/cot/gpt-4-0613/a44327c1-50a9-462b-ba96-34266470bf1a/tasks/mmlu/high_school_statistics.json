However, we need to check the other options as well to see if there's a more appropriate statement.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because the average (mean) donation does not imply that 50% of the donations are more than $155. That would be the case if $155 was the median, not the mean.\n\nOption (C) and (D) are about confidence intervals. A 95% confidence interval is a range of values that you can be 95% certain contains the true mean of the population. In this case, the population is the donations given during the month of November. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the confidence interval. We would need the standard error, which requires the sample size and the standard deviation.

If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n- The mean is the average of a set of numbers, calculated by adding all numbers in the set and then dividing by the quantity of numbers.\n- The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set.\n\nNow, let's apply these definitions to the sets X and Y.\n\n(A) The sets have identical medians.\nTo find the median, we need to find the middle number of each set. Both sets have 7 numbers, so the median will be the 4th number. For set X, the 4th number is 50. For set Y, the 4th number is also 50. So, the statement is true.\n\n(B) The sets have identical means.\nTo find the mean, we need to add all the numbers in each set and divide by the quantity of numbers. The sum of set X is 350 and the sum of set Y is 350. Since both sets have 7 numbers, the mean of both sets is 350/7 = 50. So, the statement is true.\n\n(C) The sets have identical ranges.\nTo find the range, we need to subtract the smallest number in the set from the largest. For both sets, the smallest number is 10 and the largest is 90. So, the range of both sets is 90 - 10 = 80.

Confidence Level: A higher confidence level will result in a wider confidence interval.

In order to use a \u03c72 procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5. \n\nThis statement is generally true. The chi-square test is based on certain assumptions, one of which is that the expected frequency of each cell in the table should be at least 5. This is to ensure that the chi-square distribution is a valid approximation of the true distribution.\n\nII. In order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The number of degrees of freedom for a chi-square test depends on the number of categories or groups being compared, not on a fixed number. For example, if you are comparing observed and expected frequencies for three groups, you would have 2 degrees of freedom (calculated as number of groups - 1).

This is done by subtracting the mean from the value and then dividing by the standard deviation. This process is called finding the z-score.\n\nThe formula for finding the z-score is:\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere:\nX = value (3,000 loaves)\n\u03bc = mean (2,500 loaves)\n\u03c3 = standard deviation (225 loaves)\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\nZ = (3000 - 2500) / 225\n\nAfter calculating the above expression, we get a z-score.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the bakery will run out of bread. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the demand will be greater than 3,000 loaves. Since the standard normal distribution table gives the probability that a value is less than a given z-score, we need to subtract the probability associated with our z-score from 1 to find the probability that the demand will be greater than 3,000 loaves.\n\nFinally, we look up the z-score in the standard normal distribution table to find the corresponding probability and subtract it from 1 to get the final answer. \n\nLet's calculate the z-score and find the corresponding probability. \n\nZ = (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 2.22\n\nLooking up a z-score of 2.22 in the standard normal distribution table, we find a probability of 0.9869. \n\nHowever, since we want the probability that the demand will be greater than 3,000 loaves, we subtract this probability from 1:\n\n1 - 0.9869 = 0.0131\n\nThe closest answer to this is (D) 0.0132. \n\nSo, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread is approximately 0.0132 or 1.32%.\n\n(D) 0.0132",
