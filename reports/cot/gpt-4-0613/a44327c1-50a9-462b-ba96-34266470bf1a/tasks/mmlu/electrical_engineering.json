            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Induction heating is a process which is used to heat an electrically conducting object, usually a metal, by electromagnetic induction. The basic principle is that a high frequency alternating current (AC) is supplied to the primary coil, creating a changing magnetic field within the coil. This changing magnetic field induces a current in the conductive object. The induced current flowing through the resistance of the material heats it.\n\nThe key point here is that the material must be conductive, because the heating effect is due to the resistance of the material to the induced current. Therefore, insulating materials (option C) cannot be heated by induction.\n\nThe material does not need to be magnetic. While magnetic materials can be heated by induction due to hysteresis losses (energy lost due to the reorientation of the magnetic domains), non-magnetic materials can also be heated by induction due to I^2R losses (also known as Joule heating, where heat is produced by the resistance to the flow of the induced current). Therefore, both magnetic and non-magnetic materials can be heated by induction, as long as they are conductive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.",

            "model_answer": "MSD stands for Most Significant Digit. In the decimal number system, the most significant digit is the digit that carries the most weight or value. \n\nIn the decimal number system, the value of each digit depends on its position in the number. The further to the left a digit is, the more value it has. This is because the decimal number system is a positional system, where each position is a power of 10. \n\nFor example, in the number 1234, the digit 1 is the most significant because it is in the thousands place, which is the highest power of 10 in this number. \n\nTherefore, the MSD in the decimal number system is the first digit from left to right.\n\n(A) First digit from left to right",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The core type induction furnace operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction. This means that an alternating current is passed through the primary coil, which creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field then induces a current in the secondary coil, which is used to heat the metal.\n\nOption (A) states that with normal frequency supply the electromagnetic forces cause severe stirring action in the molten metal. This is true. The electromagnetic forces created by the alternating current can cause the molten metal to move or stir. This stirring action can be beneficial in some cases as it can help to mix the metal and ensure a uniform temperature. However, if the frequency is too high, the stirring action can become too severe and can cause splashing or other problems. Therefore, a low frequency supply is often used to reduce the severity of the stirring action.\n\nOption (B) states that the magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor. This is also true. The efficiency of an induction furnace depends on the degree of magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuits. If the coupling is poor, the furnace will not operate efficiently. The degree of coupling is affected by several factors, including the frequency of the supply. A lower frequency can improve the coupling and therefore improve the efficiency of the furnace.\n\nTherefore, both statements A and B are correct reasons for why a low frequency supply is necessary for direct core type induction furnaces.\n\n(C) Both A and B.",

The radius r is given as 1 meter, so the area of the metal surface is \u03c0(1 m)^2 = \u03c0 m^2.\n\nMultiplying the surface charge density by the area of the metal surface gives the total charge enclosed by the cube. \n\nSo, the total charge enclosed by the cube is 20 coulombs/m^2 * \u03c0 m^2 = 20\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nHowever, the electric displacement is a vector quantity, and since it is outward normal to the surface of the cube, it is in both directions, up and down.
