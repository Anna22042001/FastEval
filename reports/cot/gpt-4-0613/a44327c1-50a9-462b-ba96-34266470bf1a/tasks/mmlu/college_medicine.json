            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body has several mechanisms to maintain its internal temperature, especially when the environmental temperature increases. These mechanisms are part of the body's thermoregulation process.\n\n(A) Decreasing salt retention: This is not a direct response to increased environmental temperature. While it's true that sweating (which is a response to heat) can lead to loss of salt, the body doesn't actively decrease salt retention as a response to heat.\n\n(B) Increasing respiration rate: While respiration rate can increase with heat as a part of the body's attempt to maintain homeostasis, it's not the primary method of cooling the body down.\n\n(C) Increasing heart rate: When it's hot, the heart rate can increase to help distribute the heat throughout the body and to the skin where it can be lost to the environment. However, this is not the primary method the body uses to cool down.\n\n(D) Increasing water lost through skin: This is the primary method the body uses to cool down in response to increased environmental temperature. The body sweats, and as the sweat evaporates from the skin, it helps to cool the body down.\n\nSo, the body's primary method of compensating for increased environmental temperature is by increasing water lost through the skin.\n\n(D)",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking about the primary fate of lactate, a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism in the muscles, once it enters the bloodstream.\n\nLet's go through the options one by one:\n\n(A) Conversion to urea in the liver: While the liver does play a role in metabolizing lactate, it does not convert lactate into urea. Urea is a waste product of protein metabolism, not lactate metabolism.\n\n(B) Conversion to glucose in the heart: The heart does not have the capability to convert lactate into glucose. This process, known as gluconeogenesis, primarily occurs in the liver.\n\n(C) Excretion via the kidneys: While the kidneys do play a role in excreting waste products from the body, lactate is not typically one of them. The body prefers to utilize lactate as an energy source rather than excrete it.\n\n(D) Uptake and oxidation by other tissues: This is the primary fate of lactate once it enters the bloodstream. Lactate can be taken up by various tissues in the body, including the heart, brain, and liver, where it can be oxidized to produce energy.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

The location of this process depends on the type of cell. In prokaryotic cells, which lack a defined nucleus, transcription occurs in the cytoplasm. However, in eukaryotic cells, which have a defined nucleus, transcription occurs within the nucleus. \n\nThe ribosomes (option A) are the sites of protein synthesis, where the information in mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids to form a protein. This is a separate process from transcription.\n\nTranscription does not only occur during cell division (option D). It can occur whenever the cell needs to produce a protein, which can be at any point in the cell's life cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus (option C) in eukaryotic cells. \n\n(C)",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking which molecule will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to understand the process of cellular respiration, which is how cells generate energy. Cellular respiration consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.\n\n(A) Oxaloacetate is a molecule that is produced in the Krebs cycle, which is the second stage of cellular respiration. This cycle does not directly require oxygen, but it does rely on the products of the electron transport chain, which does require oxygen.\n\n(B) Pyruvate is a molecule that is produced in glycolysis, which is the first stage of cellular respiration. This process does not require oxygen.\n\n(C) Water is a molecule that is produced in the electron transport chain, which is the third and final stage of cellular respiration. This process requires oxygen.\n\n(D) Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a molecule that is produced in all three stages of cellular respiration. However, the majority of ATP is produced in the electron transport chain, which requires oxygen.\n\nWhen oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the electron transport chain will stop first because it directly requires oxygen to function. Therefore, the molecule that is produced in this stage will stop being produced first.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Water.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand what an intracellular buffer is. A buffer is a solution that can resist pH change upon the addition of an acidic or basic components. It is able to neutralize small amounts of added acid or base, thus maintaining the pH of the solution relatively stable. This is important in many biological systems; for example, the pH of blood and various cellular processes must be kept steady in a process known as homeostasis.\n\nIntracellular buffers are substances within the cell that serve this purpose. They can bind to H+ ions when there are too many (which would lower the pH and make the environment more acidic) and release H+ ions when there are too few (which would raise the pH and make the environment more basic).\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Glutamine is an amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It does not have buffering properties.\n\n(B) Glucose is a simple sugar that is an important energy source in living organisms and is a component of many carbohydrates. It is not a buffer.\n\n(C) Carnosine is a dipeptide molecule, made up of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine. It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues, and is known for its buffering properties. It can help maintain the pH within cells by absorbing excess H+ ions that are released in processes like glycolysis, which can produce lactic acid and lower the pH.\n\n(D) Amylase is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of starch into sugars. It does not have buffering properties.\n\nSo, the only molecule in the list that can act as an intracellular buffer is carnosine.\n\n(C) Carnosine",
