            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each statement one by one:\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is true. When an object is thrown upwards, it slows down due to the force of gravity until it reaches its highest point. At this highest point, the object momentarily stops before it starts to fall back down. Therefore, the speed of the ball is indeed zero at the highest point.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nThis statement is false. Even though the ball's speed is zero at the highest point, it is still under the influence of gravity. Gravity is constantly accelerating the ball downwards, even at the highest point. Therefore, the ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThis statement is true. When the ball is thrown upwards, it is working against gravity, which slows it down. However, when it falls back down, gravity accelerates it, making the descent faster. Additionally, air resistance also slows the ball down more on the way up than on the way down. Therefore, it takes longer for the ball to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) I & III only",

            "model_answer": "The electric force between two charged particles is given by Coulomb's law, which states that the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\nF = k * |q1*q2| / r^2\n\nwhere F is the force, k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between the charges.\n\nIn this case, the force on particle A due to B (F_A) is given by:\n\nF_A = k * |2Q*Q| / 4^2\n\nand the force on particle B due to A (F_B) is given by:\n\nF_B = k * |Q*2Q| / 4^2\n\nAs you can see, the expressions for F_A and F_B are identical, meaning that the forces are equal in magnitude. This is due to Newton's third law, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, the force that A exerts on B is equal to the force that B exerts on A.\n\nSo, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is 1:1.\n\n(C) 1:01",

In this case, the object is floating, which means the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the volume of water displaced\nThe weight of the object is 6 N. The weight of water is approximately 9.8 N/m^3.
