            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The angular resolution of the human eye is the smallest angle over which we can distinguish two separate points. If the angular separation of two stars is smaller than this, it means that the two stars are so close together (from our perspective on Earth) that they fall within this smallest distinguishable angle.\n\nThis means that the two stars will not be distinguishable as separate points of light. Instead, they will appear to merge into a single point of light because our eyes cannot resolve the small angular separation between them.\n\nTherefore, the two stars will look like a single point of light.\n\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

Therefore, to calculate the bolometric luminosity, we must integrate the luminosity over all wavelengths, not just those that are vertically polarized, horizontally polarized, or visible.\n\nSo, the bolometric luminosity in astronomy is the luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.\n\n(D) The luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The strength of a planet's magnetic field is determined by its dynamo effect, which is the process by which a celestial body like a planet generates a magnetic field. The dynamo effect requires three conditions: a conducting fluid, rotation, and convection.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) The size of a planet does not directly determine the strength of its magnetic field. For example, Jupiter is much larger than Earth, but its magnetic field is not necessarily stronger. So, this option is not correct.\n\n(B) Volcanic activity is not directly related to the strength of a planet's magnetic field. While it is true that volcanic activity can indicate the presence of a molten core (which is necessary for a magnetic field), it does not determine the strength of the magnetic field. So, this option is not correct.\n\n(C) This option states that Earth has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation. These are two of the three conditions necessary for the dynamo effect. The molten core provides the conducting fluid, and the rotation of the planet helps to create the necessary movement of this fluid. This option seems to be the most likely answer.\n\n(D) While rotation is necessary for the dynamo effect, it is not the only factor. A planet could rotate very quickly but still have a weak magnetic field if it does not also have a conducting fluid (like a molten core). So, this option is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.",

            "model_answer": "The formation of the solar system is explained by the nebular hypothesis. According to this theory, the solar system began as a giant cloud of molecular gas and dust. Then, nearly 4.6 billion years ago, something happened that caused the cloud to collapse. This might have been the shockwave from a nearby supernova. As the cloud collapsed, it began to spin and flatten into a disk, with the future Sun at the center.\n\nThe inner part of the nebula was much hotter than the outer part. This is because it was closer to the proto-Sun, which was heating the nebula. In the hot inner part of the nebula, only metals and rocks were able to condense out of the nebular gas. These materials are denser than the materials that were able to condense in the cooler outer regions of the nebula.\n\nIn the cooler outer regions, hydrogen compounds like water, methane, and ammonia were able to condense. These compounds are much less dense than metals and rocks. This is why the outer planets, which formed in the cooler outer regions of the nebula, are made mostly of hydrogen compounds and are much less dense than the inner planets.\n\nSo, the reason why the inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets is because in the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\n\n(B)",

These compounds are made up of hydrogen combined with oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, which are among the next most abundant elements in the universe after hydrogen and helium.\n\nFinally, the least abundant elements in the solar nebula would be metals and rocks.

            "model_answer": "Ptolemy's model of the universe, known as the Ptolemaic system, was geocentric, meaning it placed the Earth at the center of the universe. The planets, according to this model, moved in small circles (epicycles) while simultaneously moving in larger circles (deferents) around the Earth. This complex system of 'circles upon circles' was Ptolemy's attempt to reconcile the observed motion of the planets with the prevailing philosophical belief that heavenly bodies moved in perfect circles.\n\nThe primary reason for this model was to explain the apparent retrograde motion of the planets. Retrograde motion is the apparent change in the movement of a planet through the sky. It is not that the planet has changed direction; rather, its apparent reversal is due to the relative positions of the planet and Earth and how they are moving around the Sun. From our perspective on Earth, the planet appears to move eastward relative to the stars. However, when Earth, in its faster inner orbit, overtakes the planet in its outer orbit, the planet appears to slow, stop, and move westward relative to the stars. Once Earth has passed the planet, it appears to resume its eastward motion.\n\nThis apparent retrograde motion could not be explained by simple circular orbits, so Ptolemy introduced the concept of epicycles to account for it. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) To explain the fact that planets sometimes appear to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky.",

Some people may be able to see light of slightly shorter or longer wavelengths.\n\nNow, let's compare this range to the options given:\n\n(A) 240 to 680 nm - This range is too broad, as it includes wavelengths shorter than 400 nm, which are not typically visible to the human eye.\n\n(B) 360 to 620 nm - This range is also too broad on the shorter wavelength end, and it doesn't extend far enough on the longer wavelength end.\n\n(C) 380 to 740 nm - This range is a close approximation to the typical human visible light spectrum.
