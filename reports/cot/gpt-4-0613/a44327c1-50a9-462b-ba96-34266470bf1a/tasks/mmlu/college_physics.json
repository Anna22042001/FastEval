            "model_answer": "The total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. \n\nThe kinetic energy (KE) can be calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. \n\nThe potential energy (PE) can be calculated using the formula PE = 1/2 * k * x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. \n\nHowever, we don't know the spring constant k. But we know that the total mechanical energy is conserved in this system. This means that when the mass is at the equilibrium position (where the potential energy is zero), all the mechanical energy is in the form of kinetic energy. \n\nSo, we can calculate the total mechanical energy by calculating the kinetic energy at the equilibrium position.\n\nLet's calculate the kinetic energy:\n\nKE = 1/2 * m * v^2\nKE = 1/2 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2\nKE = 0.00024 J or 0.24 mJ\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.24 mJ.\n\n(A) 0.24 mJ",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to calculate the work done on the box. The work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the box is 1/2 * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 5 Joules.\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the box is 1/2 * 10 kg * (2 m/s)^2 = 20 Joules.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy, and thus the work done on the box, is 20 Joules - 5 Joules = 15 Joules.\n\nNext, we need to find the force that was applied to the box. The work done on an object is also equal to the force applied to it times the distance over which the force is applied. So, we can set up the equation 15 Joules = F * 5 m, where F is the force applied to the box.\n\nSolving for F gives F = 15 Joules / 5 m = 3 N.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the force applied to the box is 3 N.\n\n(C) 3 N",

This occurs when the path difference between the light reflected from the top surface of the oil and the light reflected from the bottom surface of the oil is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\nThe path difference is twice the thickness of the oil layer (since the light has to travel down through the oil and then back up), multiplied by the index of refraction of the oil (since the light travels slower in the oil than in air).\n\nSo, the condition for constructive interference is:\n\n2 * thickness * index of refraction = m * wavelength\n\nwhere m is an integer. \n\nWe want to find the smallest wavelength that satisfies this condition, since smaller wavelengths are more strongly reflected. \n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n2 * 500 nm * 1.5 = m * wavelength\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n1500 nm = m * wavelength\n\nThe smallest integer m that will give a wavelength within the given options is m = 3, which gives a wavelength of 500 nm. \n\nSo, the most strongly reflected wavelength is 500 nm.\n\n(A) 500 nm",
