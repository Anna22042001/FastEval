            "model_answer": "The criteria for separate disclosure of operating segments in financial statements are set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, Segment Reporting. According to ASC 280, an operating segment should be reported separately if:\n\n1. Its reported revenue, including both sales to external customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 percent or more of the combined revenue, internal and external, of all operating segments.\n\n2. The absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 percent or more of the greater, in absolute amount, of (i) the combined reported profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss and (ii) the combined reported loss of all operating segments that reported a loss.\n\n3. Its assets are 10 percent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments.\n\nLet's apply these criteria to Swift's operating segments:\n\n1. Revenue test: Segment A's revenue is $42,000 (since the figures are in thousands), which is 23.7% of the total revenue ($42,000/$177,000). Segment B's revenue is $121,000, which is 68.4% of the total. Segment C's revenue is $14,000, which is 7.9% of the total. So, segments A and B pass the revenue test, but C does not.\n\n2. Profit or loss test: Segment A's profit is $12,000, which is 16.2% of the total profit ($12,000/$74,000). Segment B's profit is $65,000, which is 87.8% of the total. Segment C's loss is $3,000, which is less than 10% of the total profit. So, segments A and B pass the profit or loss test, but C does not.\n\n3. Assets test: Segment A's assets are $470,000, which is 34.8% of the total assets ($470,000/$1,350,000). Segment B's assets are $800,000, which is 59.3% of the total. Segment C's assets are $80,000, which is 5.9% of the total. So, segments A and B pass the assets test, but C does not.\n\nBased on these tests, only segments A and B are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) A and B only.",

Before accepting a new client or continuing with an existing one, a CPA firm must evaluate the integrity of the client, any potential risks associated with the client, and the firm's ability to serve the client professionally. \n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management: While professional skepticism is an important aspect of an auditor's mindset, it is not a part of the firm's quality control policies and procedures. It is more of an individual auditor's responsibility rather than a firm-wide policy.\n\n(C) Computer information processing: This is more related to the tools and techniques used in the auditing process, not a quality control policy or procedure.\n\n(D) Efficiency of organizational structures: This is more related to the management of the firm itself, not a quality control policy or procedure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Acceptance of a client relationship.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The right of a shareholder to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute. This means that option (A) is incorrect. There are certain conditions that must be met for a shareholder to exercise this right.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect. The right to inspect corporate books and records is not conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock. The right to inspect is generally available to all shareholders, regardless of the amount of stock they own.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect as well. While allegations of fraud or illegality may certainly justify a shareholder's inspection of corporate books and records, the right to inspect is not limited to these circumstances. Shareholders have the right to inspect for other reasons as well.\n\nThis leaves us with option (C), which states that the right to inspect requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose. This is generally correct. Shareholders must have a proper purpose to inspect corporate books and records. This is to prevent abuse of the right to inspect and to ensure that the inspection is in the best interest of the corporation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C).

The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10% on fund used, a 15% compensating balance, and a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The first step is to calculate the total amount of money that the Houser Company will have access to after borrowing $200,000. This is done by subtracting the compensating balance from the borrowed amount. The compensating balance is 15% of the borrowed amount, which is $200,000 * 0.15 = $30,000. So, the company will have $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the interest that the company will pay on the borrowed amount. The interest rate is 10%, so the company will pay $200,000 * 0.10 = $20,000 in interest.\n\nThe company also has to pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of the credit line. The unused amount is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000. The commitment fee is 1% of this amount, which is $300,000 * 0.01 = $3,000.\n\nThe total cost of the loan is the sum of the interest and the commitment fee, which is $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the effective annual interest cost. This is done by dividing the total cost of the loan by the amount of money the company has access to, and then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. The calculation is ($23,000 / $170,000) * 100 = 13.53%.\n\nSo, the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year is closest to 13.53%.\n\n(D) 13.53 percent.",

This is the amount of cash that Rune Co. has in its bank account on December 31.\n\n2. The $4,000 check payable to Rune is postdated to January 3.

The $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance was returned by the bank on December 30 stamped \"NSF\" (Non-Sufficient Funds). This means that the check bounced and the money was taken out of Rune's account. However, the check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9. Since the check bounced before December 31, the $1,000 should not be included in the December 31 cash balance.\n\nSo, the cash balance on December 31 should be the $10,000 checkbook balance minus the $1,000 NSF check, which equals $9,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) $9,000.",
