P is invertible.\nA linear transformation is invertible if and only if it is bijective, i.e., it is both injective (or one-to-one) and surjective (or onto). However, the condition P^2 = P does not necessarily imply that P is invertible. For example, consider the linear transformation P: R^2 -> R^2 defined by P(x, y) = (x, 0). Then P^2 = P, but P is not invertible because it is not surjective (there is no vector in the domain that maps to, for example, (0, 1) in the codomain). So, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nII. P is diagonalizable.\nA linear transformation is diagonalizable if there exists a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of P. The condition P^2 = P is equivalent to P(P - I) = 0, which means that every vector in V is an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0 or 1. Therefore, P is diagonalizable.

Two groups are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their elements that preserves the group operations. \n\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups tells us that every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of prime power order, and these groups are unique up to the order of the factors. \n\nThis means that for a group of order n to be unique up to isomorphism, n must be a prime number. This is because if n is a composite number, it can be factored into prime numbers in different ways, leading to different groups of order n.\n\nSo, we need to find the prime numbers between 3 and 11 inclusive.

This is because compactness guarantees that the function will attain both a maximum and a minimum value on the set.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. Consider, for example, the open interval (0,1) in R.

Therefore, boundedness of all continuous real-valued functions on a set does not imply compactness of the set.\n\nIII.

The first player can win either by tossing a head on the first toss (with probability 1/2), or by both players tossing tails on their first toss (with probability (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4) and then winning the \"new game\" (with probability P).
