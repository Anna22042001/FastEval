The rectangle is defined by the points (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2). \n\nThe inequality $x < y$ represents the region of the plane where the x-coordinate of a point is less than its y-coordinate. This region is a triangle that is bounded by the x-axis, the y-axis, and the line y=x. \n\nHowever, since our rectangle only extends to y=2, the region of interest is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). \n\nThe area of the rectangle is 3*2 = 6 square units.

This is a classic example of exponential growth, which can be modeled by the equation P = P0 * e^(kt), where P is the final population, P0 is the initial population, k is the growth rate, and t is the time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the growth rate k. We know that the initial population P0 is 200, the final population P after 10 hours is 600 (since the population triples), and the time t is 10 hours. We can plug these values into the equation and solve for k:\n\n600 = 200 * e^(10k)\n3 = e^(10k)\nln(3) = 10k\nk = ln(3) / 10\n\nNow that we have the growth rate, we can find the population after 1 full day (24 hours).

This means he is now 10 miles north and 3 miles east of his starting point.\n\nNext, he turns west and walks 6 miles. Since he was already 3 miles to the east, walking 6 miles to the west means he is now 3 miles to the west of his starting point (6 miles west - 3 miles east = 3 miles west).\n\nFinally, he turns south and walks 16 miles. Since he was already 10 miles to the north, walking 16 miles to the south means he is now 6 miles to the south of his starting point (16 miles south - 10 miles north = 6 miles south).\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from his starting point. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the two sides are the distances the person is from his starting point in the east-west and north-south directions.\n\nSo, we square the distance in the east-west direction (3 miles), square the distance in the north-south direction (6 miles), add these two numbers together, and then take the square root of the result.\n\nThis gives us sqrt((3^2) + (6^2)) = sqrt(9 + 36) = sqrt(45) \u2248 6.7 miles.\n\nSo, the person is approximately 6.7 miles from his starting point.\n\n(B) 6.7",

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the product of the lowest powers of all prime numbers that appear in the factorization of both numbers.\n\nGiven that the LCM divided by the GCD is 33, we know that the other number must contribute a factor of 33 to the LCM, and cannot contribute any additional factors to the GCD. This means that the other number must be a multiple of 33 that does not include any additional factors of 3 or 5.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that only (A) 165 is a multiple of 33.
