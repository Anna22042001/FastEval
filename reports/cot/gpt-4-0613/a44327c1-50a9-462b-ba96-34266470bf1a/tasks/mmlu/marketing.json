While this aligns with the idea of long-term economic development, it doesn't necessarily imply fairness or equality, which could be important in sustainable development.\n\n(B) Ecological, equitable, and economic: This option suggests that marketing should be environmentally friendly, fair, and economically beneficial. This seems to align well with the idea of long-term economic development, as it implies a balance between profit, fairness, and environmental sustainability.\n\n(C) Evolutionary, equitable, and economic: This option suggests that marketing should be progressive, fair, and economically beneficial. While this also aligns with the idea of long-term economic development, it doesn't necessarily imply environmental sustainability, which could be important in sustainable development.\n\n(D) Ecological, equitable, and emerging: This option suggests that marketing should be environmentally friendly, fair, and innovative.

            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the term that refers to the importance and significance of customer experience to both individuals and society. \n\n(A) Knowledge economy refers to an economy where knowledge is the primary production resource instead of capital and labor.

While customer experience is important in a service economy, this term doesn't specifically refer to the importance of customer experience.\n\n(C) Experience economy is an economy in which many goods or services are sold by emphasizing the effect they can have on people's experiences.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "CSR stands for Corporate Social Responsibility. It is a self-regulating business model that helps a company be socially accountable\u2014to itself, its stakeholders, and the public. By practicing corporate social responsibility, also called corporate citizenship, companies can be conscious of the kind of impact they are having on all aspects of society, including economic, social, and environmental.\n\n(A) Corporations have responsibilities going beyond the production of their offerings at a profit. This is a rationale for CSR as it emphasizes that corporations have responsibilities beyond just making a profit, such as contributing to societal and environmental well-being.\n\n(B) Corporations have a broader constituency of stakeholders than shareholders alone. This is also a rationale for CSR as it recognizes that corporations have responsibilities to a wide range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate, not just to their shareholders.\n\n(D) Corporations serve a wider range of human values, not captured solely by a focus on economic values. This is another rationale for CSR as it acknowledges that corporations can and should contribute to a wide range of human values, not just economic ones.\n\n(C) The impacts of corporations limit to only simple marketplace transactions. This statement is not a rationale for CSR. In fact, it contradicts the principles of CSR, which recognize that the impacts of corporations extend far beyond simple marketplace transactions to include social, environmental, and economic impacts.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) The impacts of corporations limit to only simple marketplace transactions.",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the term that refers to organizations that work together to ensure that products or services reach end users quickly and efficiently. \n\n(A) Vehicle is not the correct answer because in the context of marketing, a vehicle usually refers to a specific medium used to deliver a marketing message to a target audience.\n\n(B) Courier is not the correct answer because a courier is a company or person that delivers packages and letters, usually in a local area. While a courier could be part of a marketing channel, it does not encompass the entire concept.\n\n(C) Transportation is not the correct answer because it refers to the movement of goods from one place to another. Like courier, transportation could be part of a marketing channel, but it does not represent the whole concept.\n\n(D) Distribution channel is the correct answer because it refers to the chain of businesses or intermediaries through which a good or service passes until it reaches the end consumer. It can include wholesalers, retailers, distributors, and even the internet. This term encompasses the entire concept of organizations working together to get a product or service to the end user.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) Distribution channel.",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking for the term that describes a process where customers are actively involved in creating value, through dialogue and personalizing their experiences. \n\n(A) Interactive marketing refers to a marketing strategy that encourages active participation between the consumer and the marketing campaign. This could be a part of the process described, but it doesn't fully encompass the idea of customers co-constructing personalized experiences.\n\n(B) Co-creation experience is a business strategy focusing on customer experience and interactive, spontaneous, and participatory interaction between customer and company. This is a strong contender as it directly involves customers in the creation of value.\n\n(C) Relationship marketing is a form of marketing developed from direct response marketing campaigns that emphasizes customer retention and satisfaction, rather than a dominant focus on sales transactions. While this could involve some level of customer participation, it doesn't necessarily involve them in the creation of value.\n\n(D) Organization marketing is a process that is designed to communicate the organization's mission, vision and values in an effort to attract, motivate, convert and retain the ideal customer base. This doesn't necessarily involve customers in the creation of value.\n\nBased on these definitions, the term that best fits the description in the question is co-creation experience.\n\n(B) Co-creation experience.",

This concept is not just about the functional use of a product, but also about the emotional and sensory pleasure that consumers derive from the experience of using a product. \n\n(A) Social interaction perspective is more about how consumers interact with each other and how these interactions influence their consumption behaviors. \n\n(B) Functional utilization perspective focuses on the practical and utilitarian use of a product, which is not the main focus of hedonic consumption.\n\n(D) Brand management perspective is more about how a brand is perceived and managed, which is not directly related to the hedonic consumption of products.\n\n(C) Experiential consumption, on the other hand, is about the experience and enjoyment that consumers derive from the consumption of goods and services, which aligns with the concept of hedonic consumption.\n\nTherefore, the investigation of the hedonic consumption of products is (C) Experiential consumption.",

This is not the correct answer because the question specifies a low price.\n\n(B) Price skimming is a strategy where a high price is set initially and then gradually lowered over time. This is not the correct answer because the question specifies a low price from the start.\n\n(C) Economy pricing is a strategy where the price is set low to attract price-sensitive customers. While this strategy does involve low prices, it is not specifically aimed at gaining market share, but rather at attracting a specific segment of the market.\n\n(D) Penetration pricing is a strategy where the price is set low initially to attract customers and gain market share, with the intention of raising prices later once a significant market share has been captured.
