            "model_answer": "The complementary sequence to a DNA strand is determined by the base pairing rules of DNA. These rules state that Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G). \n\nThe given DNA strand is 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032. \n\nTo find the complementary sequence, we need to replace each base with its pair. \n\nCytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G), so we replace C with G. \nGuanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C), so we replace G with C. \nAdenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), so we replace A with T. \n\nThymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A), so we replace T with A. \nThymine (T) pairs with Adenine (A), so we replace T with A. \nGuanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C), so we replace G with C. \n\nSo, the complementary sequence to 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 is 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032.",

            "model_answer": "Mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with the roots of most plant species. This relationship provides several benefits to the plants, including increased nutrient uptake, disease resistance, and improved soil structure. \n\n(A) While mycorrhizal fungi do help in water absorption, they do not specifically protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats. \n\n(B) Mycorrhizal fungi do not fix nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation is primarily carried out by certain bacteria, not fungi.\n\n(C) Mycorrhizal fungi do provide access to phosphorus. They extend the root system and can access and absorb nutrients like phosphorus from areas of the soil that the plant roots cannot reach. \n\n(D) Mycorrhizal fungi do not provide carbon to plants. Instead, they receive carbon from the plants in the form of sugars.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.",

This is because the cis face of the Golgi apparatus is where it receives vesicles containing proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n(B) The Golgi apparatus is typically associated with small secretory vesicles, but these are usually located near its trans face, not its cis face. The trans face is the 'shipping' side of the Golgi apparatus, where it sends out modified proteins and lipids in vesicles to their final destinations.\n\n(C) The cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are not continuous with one another. They are separate, flattened sacs.\n\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins does not occur prior to the protein's entry into the Golgi apparatus.

Instead, it fuses with two polar nuclei located in the central cell of the ovule.

This means that the inhibitor and the substrate are in competition for the same binding site on the enzyme. This process is reversible, meaning that the inhibitor can bind and unbind from the enzyme, unlike irreversible inhibitors which form permanent bonds with the enzyme.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because competitive inhibitors do not form irreversible covalent links with the enzyme. They bind reversibly.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because competitive inhibitors do not modify the enzyme's active site. They simply bind to it, preventing the substrate from doing so.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because competitive inhibitors do not bind to a different site than the substrate. They compete for the same binding site.\n\nOption (D) is correct because competitive inhibitors do reversibly decrease the number of enzyme molecules that are available to bind substrates.

However, the term 'histone' refers to the protein itself, not the entire structure of DNA and protein.\n\n(B) Chromatin: Chromatin is a substance within a chromosome consisting of DNA and protein. The primary function of chromatin is to compact the DNA into a smaller volume to fit in the cell. It makes up chromosomes, but it's not the specific term for the structure described in the question.\n\n(C) Nucleosome: A nucleosome is the basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes. It consists of a segment of DNA wound around eight histone proteins and resembles thread wrapped around a spool. This matches the description given in the question.\n\n(D) Solenoid: A solenoid is a coil wound into a tightly packed helix. In the context of DNA, it refers to a higher-order coiling of the DNA-histone complex, not the basic unit described in the question.\n\nSo, based on the above analysis, the correct answer is (C) Nucleosome.

They work by targeting specific processes or structures in bacterial cells that are either absent or significantly different in human cells. \n\n(A) Peptidoglycan synthesis: Antibiotics such as penicillin interfere with the synthesis of peptidoglycan, a key component of the bacterial cell wall. This causes the cell wall to weaken and eventually burst, killing the bacteria. \n\n(B) Protein synthesis: Some antibiotics, such as tetracyclines and macrolides, work by binding to bacterial ribosomes. This prevents the ribosomes from synthesizing proteins, which are essential for the bacteria's survival and reproduction.\n\n(C) DNA synthesis: Other antibiotics, such as quinolones and sulfonamides, interfere with the bacteria's ability to replicate its DNA. This prevents the bacteria from reproducing and spreading.\n\n(D) Reverse transcriptase: Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that is used by retroviruses, not bacteria, to replicate their genetic material. Antibiotics do not target reverse transcriptase because it is not present in bacteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) reverse transcriptase.",
