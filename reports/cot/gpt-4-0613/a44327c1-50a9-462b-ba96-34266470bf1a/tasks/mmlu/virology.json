            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput sequencing method that enables rapid sequencing of the base pairs in DNA or RNA samples. It has revolutionized the biological sciences. With its ultra-high throughput, scalability, and speed, NGS enables researchers to perform a wide variety of applications and study biological systems at a level never before possible.\n\n(A) NGS can indeed be used to identify a newly discovered virus. It can sequence the entire genome of the virus, providing valuable information about its origin, evolution, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n(B) NGS can also be used to search for drug resistant mutants. By sequencing the genomes of a population of organisms before and after drug treatment, researchers can identify mutations that may confer drug resistance.\n\n(C) NGS can be used to identify quasi species viruses. Quasi species are a group of viruses related by a similar mutation or mutations, competing within a highly mutagenic environment. NGS can sequence the genomes of these viruses and identify the mutations that define the quasi species.\n\n(D) It is incorrect to say that NGS cannot be used. As mentioned above, NGS has a wide variety of applications in biological research.\n\nSo, all of the options A, B, and C are correct. However, the question asks how NGS is most often used. While it can be used for all of these purposes, it is most commonly used for identifying and studying newly discovered viruses, as this is a broad application that can be applied to any new viral discovery, whereas the other options are more specific.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) To identify a newly discovered virus.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Randomization in a clinical trial is a method used to prevent bias in research. This method ensures that each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any of the groups in the study, which can include a treatment group or a control group. \n\n(A) The placebo effect is a psychological phenomenon where the subject experiences an improvement in condition simply because they believe they are receiving treatment. Randomization does not control for the placebo effect. The placebo effect is usually controlled by using a placebo control group.\n\n(B) Recall bias is a type of bias that can occur in studies that rely on participants' memory. Randomization does not control for recall bias. This type of bias is usually controlled by using prospective studies instead of retrospective studies.\n\n(C) Non-compliance refers to situations where participants do not follow the study protocol. Randomization does not control for non-compliance. This is usually controlled by using intention-to-treat analysis.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction) refers to a situation where the effect of a main exposure on an outcome is modified by the presence of another variable. Randomization helps to evenly distribute these other variables among the groups, which can control for effect modification.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Effect modification (interaction).",

These trials are used to determine whether new drugs or treatments are both safe and effective.\n\n(B) Double-blind: This is a type of study in which neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving a particular treatment. This method is used to prevent bias in research results.\n\n(C) Longitudinal: This is a research design in which data gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time. It is often used in psychology to study developmental trends across the life span, and in sociology to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations.\n\n(D) Prospective cohort: This is a type of study in which the researcher identifies a group of individuals to participate in the study, collects baseline data, and then follows the cohort over time to measure the development of the outcomes of interest.\n\nIn the given scenario, a group of people are exposed to an environmental toxin and are observed over time to ascertain the potential effects of the toxin. This is not a clinical trial because there is no new treatment or drug being tested. It is not a double-blind study because there is no mention of the participants or experimenters being unaware of who is receiving a particular treatment. It could be a longitudinal study because the participants are being observed over time. However, it is more specifically a prospective cohort study because a group of individuals are identified, baseline data is collected, and then the group is followed over time to measure the development of the outcomes of interest, which in this case is the potential effects of the toxin.\n\nTherefore, the type of study design in this scenario is a prospective cohort study.\n\n(D) Prospective cohort",

An emergent virus is a virus that has adapted and emerged as a new disease/pathogenic strain, with attributes facilitating pathogenicity in a field not normally associated with that virus. This includes viruses that are associated with severe morbidity and mortality.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) MERS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is a viral respiratory illness that first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It has caused a significant number of deaths, but it is not considered as an 'emergent' virus because it has not spread globally.\n\n(B) SARS: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is a viral respiratory disease caused by a SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It caused a global pandemic in 2002-2003, with thousands of cases and deaths worldwide. Therefore, it can be considered as an 'emergent' virus.\n\n(C) OC43: Human coronavirus OC43 is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold. It has been circulating in humans for a long time and is not considered an 'emergent' virus.\n\n(D) HKU1: Like OC43, Human coronavirus HKU1 is also one of the viruses that cause the common cold.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The papilloma family of viruses, specifically the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), is known to cause cancer through a multi-step process. \n\nFirstly, the virus infects the basal cells of the epithelium, which are the dividing cells in the skin or mucous membranes. This is where the virus begins to replicate.\n\nSecondly, the virus encodes three oncogenic proteins: E5, E6, and E7. These proteins interfere with the cell cycle control mechanisms. E6 binds to and promotes the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, while E7 binds to and inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, another tumor suppressor. This allows the cell to proliferate uncontrollably, which is a hallmark of cancer.\n\nThirdly, in some cases, the viral genome can integrate into the host cell's DNA. This is not necessary for the virus to cause cancer, but when it does happen, it can disrupt the host cell's genes and further promote cancer development.\n\nTherefore, the papilloma family of viruses causes cancer by replicating in dividing cells and encoding three oncogenic proteins E5, E6 and E7, and in some cases, integrating the viral genome into the host cell's DNA.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Replicate in dividing cells and encodes three oncogenic proteins E5, E6 and E7.",

            "model_answer": "The rabies vaccine has undergone significant changes since its inception by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century. \n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the vaccine has indeed changed since the time of L. Pasteur. Pasteur's original vaccine was made from the spinal cord of infected rabbits, which was dried for 5 to 10 days. Modern vaccines are much safer and more effective.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect. While it is true that the original vaccine was made from the spinal cord of infected rabbits, this is not a special feature of the rabies vaccine. Many early vaccines were made using similar methods.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect as well. The modern rabies vaccine does not require 16 doses given into the peritoneal cavity. The World Health Organization recommends a series of four doses over a 14-day period for post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nOption (D) is correct. The modern rabies vaccine is indeed grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo. This is a special feature of the rabies vaccine, as most other vaccines are not produced this way. The use of human diploid cells allows for a high degree of safety and efficacy in the vaccine.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) The modern rabies vaccine is grown in human diploid cells from an aborted embryo.",

This is in contrast to the innate immune system, which responds to pathogens in a generic way.\n\n(A) Speed of response to a foreign protein: This is not a special feature of adaptive immunity. In fact, the adaptive immune response is slower than the innate immune response because it takes time for the adaptive immune system to recognize and respond to specific pathogens.\n\n(B) Ability to distinguish self and non self: This is a feature of the immune system as a whole, not just the adaptive immune system. Both the innate and adaptive immune systems have mechanisms to distinguish self from non-self.\n\n(C) Ability to distinguish viruses and bacteria: This is not a special feature of adaptive immunity. Both the innate and adaptive immune systems can respond to a variety of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria.\n\n(D) Short memory: This is actually the opposite of a feature of adaptive immunity. One of the key features of adaptive immunity is its ability to remember specific pathogens, allowing for a faster and more effective response if the same pathogen is encountered again in the future.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non self. This is a feature of the immune system as a whole, but it is particularly important in the adaptive immune response, which is tailored to specific pathogens.

They are used to treat viral infections, but they are not typically used as a preventive measure.\n\n(C) Hygiene: Good hygiene practices can prevent the spread of diseases, particularly those that are transmitted through direct contact or through the fecal-oral route. This includes diseases like the common cold, influenza, and gastrointestinal infections.\n\n(D) Mosquito nets: Mosquito nets are used to prevent diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and dengue fever. However, their use is limited to areas where these diseases are prevalent.\n\nComparing these options, vaccines and hygiene practices have the broadest impact in terms of the number and types of diseases they can prevent. Antivirals and mosquito nets are more specific in their use. \n\nBetween vaccines and hygiene, vaccines have a more direct and specific role in disease prevention.
