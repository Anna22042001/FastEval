Initially, it was estimated that there were about 100,000 protein-coding genes, but this number has been revised downwards over time.\n\nThe most recent estimates suggest that there are about 19,000 to 20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. This is based on the analysis of the human genome sequence and the identification of sequences that have the characteristics of protein-coding genes.\n\nTherefore, the current estimate for the number of human protein-coding genes is in the range of 19,000 to 20,000.\n\n(B) 19,000\u201320,000",

            "model_answer": "Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects mostly the lungs, but also the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and intestine. It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).\n\nThe most common mutation, which accounts for about 70% of all cystic fibrosis cases, is a deletion of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine at the 508th position on the CFTR protein. This mutation is often referred to as \u0394F508.\n\nA deletion is a type of mutation involving the loss of genetic material. It can be small, involving a single missing DNA base pair, or large, involving a piece of a chromosome.\n\nTherefore, the most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of a deletion.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) a deletion.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are and how they relate to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and body mass index (BMI).\n\nGWAS are studies that scan the genomes of many individuals to find genetic variations associated with a particular disease or trait. SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation among people. Each SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.\n\nIn the context of BMI, GWAS have been used to identify SNPs that are associated with differences in BMI. However, despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies, known SNPs explain only a small fraction of the variation in BMI.\n\nThis is because the genetic architecture of complex traits like BMI is thought to be highly polygenic, meaning that they are influenced by many genes, each of which has a small effect. Additionally, environmental factors also play a significant role in determining BMI.\n\nThe exact percentage of variation in BMI explained by known SNPs can vary depending on the study, but it is generally quite low. \n\nThe options given are (A) only 5%, (B) less than 1%, (C) only 13%, and (D) less than 2%. \n\nBased on the information available, the most accurate answer would be (D) less than 2%. This is because, while the exact percentage can vary, it is generally agreed that known SNPs explain a very small fraction of the variation in BMI.\n\n(D) less than 2%",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both parents must pass on a defective gene in order for a child to be affected. However, the question is asking about the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU.\n\nUntreated PKU in a mother can lead to a condition known as maternal PKU syndrome in the child. This is not because the child necessarily inherits the PKU disorder, but because high levels of phenylalanine in the mother's blood can harm the developing fetus, leading to intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other health problems.\n\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is not related to the genetic inheritance of the disorder, but rather to the mother's metabolic condition during pregnancy. If a woman with PKU does not control her phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, the risk of her child developing maternal PKU syndrome is very high.\n\n(D) Almost 100%",

This receptor is responsible for removing LDL, often referred to as \"bad cholesterol,\" from the bloodstream. When the LDL receptor is not functioning properly due to a genetic mutation, LDL accumulates in the blood, leading to high cholesterol levels and an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Low density lipoprotein receptor",

This is indeed the purpose of QTL analysis. It is used to find the locations on the chromosomes (the loci) that contain genes that affect the trait being studied.\n\nOption (B) suggests that QTL analysis is used to determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage.

Mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use, each contain a small amount of DNA. \n\nSpecifically, mutations in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, MT-ND4L, and MT-ND6 genes cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are part of a large enzyme complex that performs oxidative phosphorylation, which is used to generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main source of energy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not related to any specific chromosome, but rather to the mitochondrial DNA.\n\n(D) mitochondrial DNA.",

This means that the alleles are copies of a single ancestral allele. \n\n(A) An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, would mean that there is a higher chance of two alleles being identical by descent. This would reduce the likelihood of heterozygotes (individuals with two different alleles at a locus) being present in a population, as there would be a higher chance of homozygotes (individuals with two identical alleles at a locus).\n\n(B) The inbreeding coefficient, F, does not have a direct relationship with the proportion of genes that show linkage. Linkage is the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together. This is not directly affected by inbreeding.\n\n(C) The inbreeding coefficient, F, does not have a direct relationship with the proportion of genes with introns. Introns are non-coding sections of an RNA molecule, and their presence is not directly affected by inbreeding.\n\n(D) The inbreeding coefficient, F, does not have a direct relationship with the level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells. The differences between RNA molecules in two daughter cells would be more directly related to the process of transcription and translation, not inbreeding.\n\nBased on these explanations, the correct answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",
