A mixed number is a whole number and a proper fraction combined into one \"mixed\" number.\n\nThe number 4.95 can be broken down into the whole number 4 and the decimal 0.95.\n\nTo convert the decimal into a fraction, we need to consider the place value of the decimal. The decimal 0.95 has two digits after the decimal point, so it is in the hundredths place. This means we can write 0.95 as 95/100.\n\nHowever, we need to simplify the fraction if possible. The greatest common divisor of 95 and 100 is 5. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to simplify the fraction. This gives us 19/20.\n\nSo, 4.95 as a mixed number is 4 and 19/20.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 4 and 19 over 20.",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what an improper fraction is. An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator (the top number) is greater than or equal to the denominator (the bottom number).\n\nThe problem is asking us to write the mixed number 8 and 2 over 4 as an improper fraction. A mixed number is a whole number and a fraction combined into one \"mixed\" number.\n\nTo convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fraction, then add the numerator of the fraction. This becomes the new numerator of the improper fraction. The denominator remains the same.\n\nSo, for the mixed number 8 and 2 over 4, we multiply 8 (the whole number) by 4 (the denominator), which equals 32. Then we add 2 (the numerator), which equals 34. So, the improper fraction is 34 over 4.\n\nHowever, we need to simplify this fraction to its simplest form. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator and divide both by it. The GCD of 34 and 4 is 2. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.\n\n34 divided by 2 equals 17, and 4 divided by 2 equals 2. So, the simplest form of the improper fraction is 17 over 2.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) 17 over 2.",
