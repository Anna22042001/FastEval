David was busy taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa from 7am to 9am. So, he couldn't have gone to the gas station during this time.\n2. David was busy buying a bike at the bike shop from 9am to 3pm. So, he couldn't have gone to the gas station during this time.\n3. David was walking towards the Statue of Liberty from 3pm to 9pm.
