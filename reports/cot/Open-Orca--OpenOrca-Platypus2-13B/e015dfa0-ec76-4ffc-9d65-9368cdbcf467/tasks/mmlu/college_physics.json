            "question": "A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s. Which of the following gives the magnitude of the applied force?\n\n(A) 1 N\n(B) 2 N\n(C) 3 N\n(D) 4 N",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. The box starts with a speed of 1 m/s and has a mass of 10 kg.\n2. A constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion.\n3. The box travels 5 meters with the constant force applied.\n4. The force is then removed, and the box has a speed of 2 m/s.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem:\n\n1. We know that the initial speed of the box is 1 m/s.\n2. We also know that the box travels 5 meters with the constant force applied.\n3. To find the total distance the box travels, we add the initial distance and the distance it travels with the force: 1 m (initial) + 5 m (with force) = 6 meters.\n4. We know that the final speed of the box is 2 m/s.\n5. To find the total distance the box travels with the force, we divide the total distance by the final speed: 6 meters / 2 m/s = 3 meters.\n6. Since the box travels 3 meters with the force applied, we can find the work done by the force: Work = Force * Distance = 3 meters * 1 N (force) = 3 Joules.\n7. Since the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy, we can find the change in kinetic energy: Change in Kinetic Energy = Work = 3 Joules.\n8. Now, we can find the initial kinetic energy of the box: Initial Kinetic Energy = (1/2) * Mass * Initial Speed^2 = (1/2) * 10 kg * (1 m/s)^2 = 5 Joules.\n9. To find the final kinetic energy of the box, we subtract the initial kinetic energy from the change in kinetic energy: Final Kinetic Energy = Change in Kinetic Energy - Initial Kinetic Energy = 3 Joules - 5 Joules = -2 Joules.\n10. Since the final kinetic energy is negative, the box is moving in the opposite direction after the force is removed.\n\nNow, let's find the magnitude of the applied force:\n\n11. We know that the work done by the force is equal to the change in kinetic energy: Work = Change in Kinetic Energy.\n12. We also know that the work done by the force is 3 Joules.\n13. To find the magnitude of the force, we divide the work by the distance the box travels with the force: Force = Work / Distance = 3 Joules / 3 meters = 1 N.\n\nSo, the magnitude of the applied force is 1 N. The answer is (A).",
