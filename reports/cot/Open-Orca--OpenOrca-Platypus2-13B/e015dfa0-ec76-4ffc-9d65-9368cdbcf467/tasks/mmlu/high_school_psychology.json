            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The best explanation for this fact is the (B) Schachter-Singer theory of emotions.\n\nReasoning:\n1. The Schachter-Singer theory suggests that emotions are a combination of physiological arousal (heart racing) and cognitive labels (recognizing friends).\n2. Initially, Antoinette experiences fear due to the unexpected event (people jumping out).\n3. When she realizes it's a surprise party, her fear turns into happiness, as she now has a positive cognitive label for the physiological arousal.\n4. Her heart continues to race, indicating that the physiological arousal remains, but she experiences happiness due to the cognitive label.\n\nAnswer: (B) Schachter-Singer",

For example, pupil dilation can also occur in response to low light conditions or emotional arousal. Similarly, salivation can be increased due to anticipation of food or emotional arousal. Perspiration can be caused by heat, exercise, or emotional arousal. Stress hormones can be secreted in response to various stressors, not just physiological arousal.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A) dilation of the pupils",

In this case, (C) is not relevant because the age of the baby does not necessarily affect the ethical concerns.\nStep 3: Analyze the remaining options. (A) and (B) both address ethical concerns.\nStep 4: Determine which option is more likely to be the reason for the unlikely conditioning of a baby to fear small animals in a research study at a university. (A) states that no parent would permit a child to participate in such a study, which is a more likely reason than (B) since it directly addresses the willingness of parents to allow their children to participate in the study.\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) language.\n\nReasoning:\nThe left hemisphere of the brain is dominant for most people when it comes to language processing. This is because the left hemisphere is responsible for controlling the muscles on the right side of the body, which includes the muscles involved in speech production. As a result, the left hemisphere is more involved in language processing to coordinate these muscle movements.\n\nWhile the left hemisphere is also involved in logic, analytical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning, it is not as dominant as it is for language processing. These other cognitive functions are more evenly distributed between the two hemispheres, with some individuals showing a stronger right hemisphere dominance in these areas.",
