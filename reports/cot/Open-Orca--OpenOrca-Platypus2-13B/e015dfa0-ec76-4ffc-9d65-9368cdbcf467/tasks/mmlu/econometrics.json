            "model_answer": "To determine the most plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality, let's first understand the possible reasons for non-normality in the residuals:\n\n1. Non-normality in the error terms could be due to the presence of heteroscedasticity (unequal variances) or autocorrelation in the error terms.\n2. Non-normality in the error terms could be due to the presence of outliers in the data.\n3. Non-normality in the error terms could be due to the presence of nonlinear relationships in the data.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n(A) Using a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one might help if the non-normality is due to nonlinear relationships in the data. However, this might not be the best approach if the non-normality is due to heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation.\n\n(B) Adding lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model might help if the non-normality is due to autocorrelation in the error terms. However, this might not be the best approach if the non-normality is due to heteroscedasticity or outliers.\n\n(C) Estimating the model in first differenced form might help if the non-normality is due to autocorrelation in the error terms. However, this might not be the best approach if the non-normality is due to heteroscedasticity or outliers.\n\n(D) Removing any large outliers from the data might help if the non-normality is due to outliers. However, this might not be the best approach if the non-normality is due to heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation.\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality would be:\n\n(D) Remove any large outliers from the data, as this approach addresses the issue of outliers, which could be a possible cause of non-normality in the error terms. However, it is essential to consider other possible causes of non-normality and apply appropriate methods to address them as well.",
