Kant also believed that moral principles are a priori, meaning they are known independently of experience.\n4.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze Epictetus' claim step-by-step:\n\n1. Epictetus is a Stoic philosopher, and Stoicism emphasizes the importance of maintaining inner tranquility and rationality in the face of adversity.\n2. The claim suggests that a virtuous man should not be overly affected by external events, as his focus should be on his own actions and values.\n3. The death of a virtuous man's wife and children would be an unfortunate event, but it would not necessarily change the man's virtuous nature or his ability to act virtuously.\n4. Therefore, the virtuous man should feel undisturbed by this event, as it would not affect his core values or his ability to act in accordance with them.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n(C) undisturbed.",

However, it's important to note that pleasure is not always synonymous with happiness, and seeking pleasure might not necessarily lead to happiness.\n\n(B) pursue happiness: This choice aligns with the idea that happiness can be achieved by actively seeking it.

However, this contradicts the premise of the question, which is about the best way to pursue happiness.\n\n(D) none of the above: This choice implies that none of the provided options are correct.
