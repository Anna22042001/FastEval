            "model_answer": "(B) the strength of the federal government relative to the states\n\nThe primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists during the ratification of the Constitution was over the balance of power between the federal government and the states. Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, believed in a strong central government that could effectively address national issues and maintain order. They supported the Constitution as it was written, which granted significant powers to the federal government.\n\nAnti-Federalists, on the other hand, led by Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and George Mason, were concerned about the potential for a powerful central government to infringe on individual liberties and the rights of the states. They advocated for a weaker central government with more power retained by the states. They argued that the Constitution did not sufficiently protect individual rights and state sovereignty.\n\nIn summary, the primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was over the strength of the federal government relative to the states (B).",
