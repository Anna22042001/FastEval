            "model_answer": "Induction heating takes place in:\n\n(B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.\n\nReasoning:\nInduction heating is a process where electrical energy is converted into heat by using an electromagnetic field. This electromagnetic field is generated by an alternating current (AC) passing through a coil. The material to be heated must be a conductor to allow the flow of electrical current and generate the electromagnetic field.\n\nThe material can be either magnetic or non-magnetic, as the heating process is based on the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the conducting material, not its magnetic properties. Therefore, induction heating can take place in both conducting and non-magnetic materials.",
