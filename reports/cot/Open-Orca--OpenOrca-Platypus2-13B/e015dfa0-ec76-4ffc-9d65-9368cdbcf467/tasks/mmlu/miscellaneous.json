            "model_answer": "To find the approximate number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we need to consider the number of households and the average number of movies watched per household.\n\n1. First, let's find the number of households in the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 126,833,000 households in the United States in 2019.\n\n2. Next, let's find the average number of movies watched per household. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) reported that the average American watches approximately 12 movies per month in 2019.\n\n3. Now, let's calculate the total number of movies watched per year by multiplying the number of households by the average number of movies per household.\nTotal movies watched per year = Number of households * Average movies per household\nTotal movies watched per year \u2248 126,833,000 households * 12 movies/month\nTotal movies watched per year \u2248 1,522,000,000 movies\n\n4. Finally, let's convert this number to a single letter with parenthesis.\n(C) 1,522,000,000",

            "model_answer": "To find out how much energy Americans waste each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks, we need to first determine the amount of ice used and then calculate the energy wasted.\n\nStep 1: Determine the amount of ice used\nLet's assume that the average American drinks 100 ounces of soda per day, and 70% of the soda volume is water. Since ice occupies 90% of the volume of water, we can calculate the volume of ice used per day:\n\nIce volume = (70% of soda volume) * (90% of water volume)\nIce volume = (0.7 * 0.9) * 100 ounces\nIce volume \u2248 63 ounces\n\nStep 2: Calculate the energy wasted per day\nNow, let's find out how much energy is wasted per day by throwing out the unused ice:\n\nEnergy wasted per day = Ice volume * Specific heat capacity of ice\nEnergy wasted per day \u2248 63 ounces * 54.7 J/g\nEnergy wasted per day \u2248 3.44 * 10^6 J\n\nStep 3: Calculate the energy wasted per year\nFinally, let's determine the energy wasted per year by multiplying the daily energy wasted by the number of days in a year:\n\nEnergy wasted per year = Energy wasted per day * 365 days\nEnergy wasted per year \u2248 3.44 * 10^6 J/day * 365 days\nEnergy wasted per year \u2248 1.23 * 10^10 J\n\nSo, Americans waste approximately 1.23 * 10^10 J of energy each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks.\n\nAnswer: (B) 6*10^11 J",
