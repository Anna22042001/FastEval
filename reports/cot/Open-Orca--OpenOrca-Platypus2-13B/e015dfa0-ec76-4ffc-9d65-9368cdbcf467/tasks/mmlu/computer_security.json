            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions\n\nApps developed in languages like C and C++ are prone to buffer-overflow issues because they often lack string boundary checks in their predefined functions. In these languages, memory management is typically handled by the programmer, which can lead to errors when allocating and dealing with strings.\n\nWhen a buffer is allocated to store a string, it has a fixed size. However, the programmer might not be aware of the size of the string being stored, or might not account for the possibility of the string being larger than the allocated buffer. This can result in the string overflowing the buffer, overwriting adjacent memory locations, and potentially causing unintended consequences or security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn languages with more robust memory management features, such as C#, Java, or Python, these issues are less likely to occur, as the language runtime takes care of memory allocation and string handling, reducing the chances of buffer-overflow errors.",

This can lead to overwriting crucial data structures, such as the return address on the stack. By overwriting the return address, the attacker can redirect the program control flow to a location of their choice, which typically contains the attacker-injected code. This allows the attacker-injected code to be executed when the program attempts to return from the compromised function.",
