Which proposition below is most inconsistent with this claim?\n\n(A) In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\n(B) The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\n(C) Judges exercise strong discretion.\n(D) Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.",

            "model_answer": "(D) Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.\n\nExplanation:\nDworkin's claim suggests that there is a single right answer to every legal question. However, the proposition (D) implies that judges often make decisions based on the best fit with constitutional and institutional history, which may not necessarily lead to a single right answer. This is because the \"best fit\" could be subjective and open to interpretation, allowing for multiple valid outcomes.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Greek Thinking\n\nThe idea of 'natural law' first appeared in Greek Thinking. This is because the concept of natural law can be traced back to the ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Aristotle and Plato, who believed in the existence of universal principles and moral standards that govern the natural world. These ideas later influenced Roman Law and other legal systems, but the initial development of the concept can be attributed to Greek Thinking.",

It is not based on the defendant's subjective mental state (B) or focused on the defendant's behavior (C). The standard does not differentiate between individuals with physical or mental disabilities, as it is meant to represent the behavior of an average person without any disabilities (A).",

            "model_answer": "(A) Regarding X's interest as directly related to Y's duty.\n\nThe interest theory of rights can be formulated without the correlativity of rights and duties by focusing on X's interest as directly related to Y's duty. In this approach, the emphasis is on the protection and recognition of X's interest, which may or may not require the enforcement of Y's duty. This allows for a more flexible understanding of rights and their relationship to duties, as it does not necessarily require the enforcement of duties for rights to be recognized or protected.",
