Segment C has reported revenue of $14 thousand and reported profit (loss) of $(3) thousand.\n\nNow, let's compare the segments to the criteria for separate disclosure:\n\n- If a segment's revenue is 10% or more of the company's total revenue, it must be disclosed separately.\n- If a segment's profit (loss) is 10% or more of the company's total profit (loss), it must be disclosed separately.\n\nTotal revenue for the company is $42 (A) + $121 (B) + $14 (C) = $177.\n\nTotal profit (loss) for the company is $12 (A) + $65 (B) + $(3) (C) = $74.\n\nNow, let's check if any segment meets the criteria for separate disclosure:\n\n- Segment A's revenue is 23.7% of the total revenue ($42 / $177).\n- Segment B's revenue is 68.3% of the total revenue ($121 / $177).\n- Segment C's revenue is 7.9% of the total revenue ($14 / $177).\n\n- Segment A's profit (loss) is 16.4% of the total profit (loss) ($12 / $74).\n- Segment B's profit (loss) is 88.9% of the total profit (loss) ($65 / $74).\n- Segment C's profit (loss) is -4.1% of the total profit (loss) ($(3) / $74).\n\nNone of the segments meet the criteria for separate disclosure based on revenue or profit (loss).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(D) A B and C.",
