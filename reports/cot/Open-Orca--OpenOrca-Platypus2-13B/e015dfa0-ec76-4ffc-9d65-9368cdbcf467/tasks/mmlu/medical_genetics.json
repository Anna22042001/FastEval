            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:\n\n(C) a substitution.\n\nReasoning:\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis is a single nucleotide substitution, which results in the replacement of a single base pair in the DNA sequence. This substitution leads to the production of an abnormal CFTR protein, causing the disease.",

When individuals share identical alleles, they are homozygous, and when they share different alleles, they are heterozygous. As inbreeding increases, the likelihood of sharing identical alleles also increases, leading to a higher proportion of homozygous individuals and a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in the population.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",

The most common type of \u03b1-thalassaemia is caused by a deletion of one or more nucleotides in the HBA1 or HBA2 gene, resulting in a reduced or absent production of \u03b1-globin chains. This leads to hemoglobin H, which is unstable and can cause hemolytic anemia. So, the common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion.",
