These hormone-like substances cause the uterine muscles to contract, initiating labor.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The environment for sperm passage is most hospitable just at:\n\n(C) ovulation\n\nReasoning:\nDuring ovulation, the egg is released from the ovary, creating a favorable environment for sperm to reach and fertilize the egg. The cervical mucus also becomes thinner and more mobile, allowing sperm to swim more easily through the female reproductive tract. In contrast, preovulation (A) and menstruation (D) are not ideal for sperm passage, as there is no egg present, and the cervical mucus is less favorable for sperm movement. Proliferation (B) refers to cell division, which is not directly related to sperm passage.",

In men, these infections most commonly target the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body. However, the answer choices provided do not include the urethra. Therefore, considering the given options, the most appropriate answer is:\n\n(A) penis, as it is the closest option to the urethra and is also a common site of infection for these STIs.",
