            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Philippa Foot explains the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction by appealing to:\n\n(A) rights of noninterference.\n\nPhilippa Foot argues that there is a moral difference between killing someone and letting someone die, even when both actions result in the person's death. She believes that this distinction lies in the fact that the person who kills is actively causing harm, while the person who lets someone die is not. This idea aligns with the concept of rights of noninterference, which suggests that individuals have a right not to be harmed by others. By not intervening in a situation where someone is dying, the person is respecting this right of noninterference.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Philippa Foot's explanation does not involve rights to goods and services (B), as mentioned in the options. So, the answer is:\n\n(A) rights of noninterference.",

However, it doesn't necessarily mean that Papadaki agrees with Kant's view.\n\n(B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.\nThis statement implies that Papadaki disagrees with Kant's view of sexual objectification as a violation of humanity. This is a more likely candidate for Papadaki's argument against Kant's view.\n\n(C) Sexual objectification actually enhances humanity.\nThis statement suggests that Papadaki might be arguing in favor of sexual objectification, which contradicts Kant's view. However, it's not clear if Papadaki is arguing for or against Kant's view in this statement.\n\n(D) Papadaki actually agrees with Kant's view.\nThis statement contradicts the given information that Papadaki argues against Kant's view of sexual objectification.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely answer is:\n\n(B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.",

His case against moral engineering primarily focuses on the idea that markets should not be the primary determinant of moral values. This perspective aligns more closely with Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of rationality, autonomy, and universal moral principles.\n\nIn contrast, the ethics of prima facie duty (B) focuses on the initial intuitions or judgments about moral situations, which may not be directly related to Sandel's argument. Virtue ethics (C) emphasizes the development of virtues and character traits, which is not the main focus of Sandel's case against moral engineering. Natural law theory (D) argues that certain moral principles are inherent in human nature, but Sandel's argument is more about the role of markets and moral values in society rather than the inherent nature of morality.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) a Kantian approach.",
