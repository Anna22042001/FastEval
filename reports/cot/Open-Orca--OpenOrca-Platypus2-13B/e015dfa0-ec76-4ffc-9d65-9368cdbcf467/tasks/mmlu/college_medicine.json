            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by:\n\n(C) increasing heart rate\n\nReasoning:\nWhen the body experiences an increase in environmental temperature, it tries to maintain a stable internal temperature. One way it does this is by increasing the heart rate. This allows more blood to be pumped through the circulatory system, which helps dissipate heat from the body's core to the skin surface where it can be lost to the environment.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

            "model_answer": "The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is:\n\n(D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\n\nReasoning:\nLactate is produced in muscle cells during intense exercise or anaerobic conditions when oxygen levels are low. It is then released into the bloodstream. The primary role of lactate in the body is to be transported to other tissues, particularly the liver and heart, where it can be converted back into glucose or pyruvate. This process helps maintain blood glucose levels and supports energy production in various cells. So, the main fate of lactate in the circulation is its uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded molecule of DNA is not always 1:1. In fact, it is approximately 1:2.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. In a double-stranded DNA molecule, there are two complementary strands.\n2. Each strand consists of a sequence of nucleotides, which are composed of a base, a sugar, and a phosphate group.\n3. There are four types of bases in DNA: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\n4. Purines are two bases: adenine (A) and guanine (G).\n5. Pyrimidines are the other two bases: cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\n6. In a double-stranded DNA molecule, one strand has adenine (A) and guanine (G), while the other strand has cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\n7. Since there are two purines (adenine and guanine) and only one pyrimidine (cytosine) in each strand, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is approximately 2:1.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) variable, but the actual ratio is approximately 1:2.",

            "model_answer": "When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the first molecule that will stop being produced is (A) Oxaloacetate.\n\nReasoning:\n1. In the absence of oxygen, cells primarily rely on anaerobic respiration, which involves glycolysis.\n2. Glycolysis is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert glucose into pyruvate (B) and a small amount of ATP.\n3. Pyruvate can be further metabolized in the presence of oxygen through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which produce more ATP.\n4. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are not possible, and the cell's ATP production will be limited.\n5. Oxaloacetate is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which is responsible for producing a significant amount of ATP.\n6. Since the citric acid cycle is not functional in the absence of oxygen, the production of Oxaloacetate (A) will stop first.\n\nAnswer: (A) Oxaloacetate",

            "model_answer": "(A) Glutamine\n\nGlutamine is the correct answer. It can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high.\n\nGlutamine is an amino acid that can be used as a buffer in the cell. It can bind to hydrogen ions (H+) and maintain the pH balance within the cell. When the rate of glycolysis increases, more acidic byproducts are produced, such as lactic acid. These byproducts can lower the pH of the cell. Glutamine can help neutralize these acidic byproducts, thus preventing significant pH changes within the cell.\n\nThe other options do not act as intracellular buffers:\n(B) Glucose is a sugar that can be used as an energy source during glycolysis, but it does not act as a buffer.\n(C) Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of beta-alanine and histidine, which is found in muscle tissue. It has antioxidant properties, but it does not act as an intracellular buffer.\n(D) Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars, such as glucose.

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the factors affecting blood lactate concentration during a soccer game:\n\n1. Intensity of the game: Soccer is a high-intensity sport, which means players are constantly exerting themselves. As the game progresses, the intensity increases due to fatigue and the need to maintain performance levels.\n\n2. Fatigue: As players become more fatigued, their muscles produce more lactic acid, which leads to an increase in blood lactate concentration.\n\n3. Recovery time: During halftime, players have a chance to rest and recover, which allows their bodies to clear some of the lactic acid from their muscles.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n(A) rarely increases above 3 mM: This statement is not relevant to the question, as it only provides a general guideline for blood lactate concentration.\n\n(B) is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half: This statement is true, as players have had a chance to recover during halftime, and the intensity of the game has increased.\n\n(C) is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half: This statement is also true, as players become more fatigued throughout the game, leading to an increase in blood lactate concentration.\n\n(D) increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued: This statement is true, as it explains the reason behind the increase in blood lactate concentration during the game.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n(B) is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the duration of maximal exertion exercise sustained by the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine, we need to consider the energy stored in these high-energy phosphates and the rate at which they are broken down.\n\nATP and phosphocreatine are the primary energy sources for short, high-intensity activities. When these molecules are broken down, they release energy in the form of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine is used to power muscle contractions.\n\nThe energy stored in ATP and phosphocreatine is limited, and once it is depleted, the body must rely on other energy sources, such as glycogen breakdown, to continue the exercise.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 1-2 seconds: This is too short a duration for maximal exertion exercise.\n(B) 5-10 seconds: This is a more reasonable duration for maximal exertion exercise, as it allows for a short but intense effort.\n(C) 30-40 seconds: This is too long a duration for maximal exertion exercise, as it would require a significant amount of ATP and phosphocreatine to be depleted.\n(D) 50-60 seconds: This is also too long a duration for maximal exertion exercise, as it would require even more ATP and phosphocreatine to be depleted.\n\nBased on the information provided, the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about:\n\n(B) 5-10 seconds.",
