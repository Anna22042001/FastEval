            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of XYZ Corporation buying an original Matisse painting on GDP, we need to analyze the components of GDP:\n\nGDP = C (Consumption) + I (Investment) + G (Government Spending) + (X - M) (Net Exports)\n\nNow let's examine the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. XYZ Corporation is buying an original Matisse painting, which is a form of investment.\n2. The painting is an asset, and its purchase will increase the value of the corporation's assets.\n3. Since the painting is an original work of art, it is considered a capital good.\n4. When a company invests in capital goods, it contributes to the nation's productive capacity.\n5. Investment in capital goods (I) increases GDP.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.",

The government collects more money in net taxes than it spends.\n2. This means that the government's revenue (from taxes) is greater than its expenditure (spending).\n3. A budget surplus occurs when a government's revenue exceeds its expenditure.\n4.

            "model_answer": "The best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be:\n\n(D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nReasoning:\nA supply shock refers to an unexpected event that disrupts the supply of goods and services in an economy. A negative supply shock means that the disruption leads to a decrease in the overall supply.\n\n(A) A decrease in government spending might affect the economy, but it is not necessarily a negative supply shock, as it depends on the government's fiscal policy.\n(B) A decrease in the real interest rate might have an impact on investment and consumption decisions, but it is not a direct supply shock.\n(C) An increase in the money supply could lead to inflation, but it is not a negative supply shock, as it affects the demand side of the economy rather than the supply side.\n(D) Unexpectedly higher resource prices can lead to a decrease in the overall supply of goods and services, as businesses might struggle to secure resources at higher costs, leading to reduced production. This example best represents a negative supply shock.",

Raise reserve requirements: This action will increase the money supply, as it requires banks to hold more reserves, which reduces the amount of money available for lending and investment.\n2. Lower the discount rate: This action will increase the money supply, as it makes borrowing from the Fed cheaper for banks, which can then use this money to expand their lending activities.\n3. Sell bonds: This action will decrease the money supply, as it reduces the amount of money in circulation by selling bonds to the public.\n4. Buy bonds: This action will increase the money supply, as it increases the amount of money in circulation by purchasing bonds from the public.\n\nNow, let's compare the lists:\n\n(A) Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; sell bonds.\n(B) Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n(C) Raise reserve requirements; raise the discount rate; sell bonds.\n(D) Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\nComparing the actions in each list, we can see that:\n\n- List A contains one action that increases the money supply (lower the discount rate) and two actions that decrease the money supply (raise reserve requirements and sell bonds).\n- List B contains one action that increases the money supply (lower the discount rate) and one action that decreases the money supply (raise reserve requirements).\n- List C contains one action that increases the money supply (raise reserve requirements) and one action that decreases the money supply (raise the discount rate).\n- List D contains one action that increases the money supply (lower the discount rate) and one action that decreases the money supply (buy bonds).\n\nThe list that contains only Fed actions that will increase the money supply is:\n\n(B) Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.",

They can have different effects on domestic prices depending on the type of tariff or quota and the specific circumstances.\n\n(A) result in higher domestic prices: Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, generally raise the price of those goods in the domestic market. This is because the importer has to pay the tariff, which is then passed on to the consumer.\n\n(C) do not necessarily affect domestic prices: Quotas, on the other hand, limit the quantity of goods that can be imported rather than imposing a tax. In some cases, quotas can lead to higher domestic prices if the demand for the imported goods is high and the quota is not sufficient to meet that demand. However, in other cases, quotas may not necessarily affect domestic prices if the quota is set at a level that meets the domestic demand without causing significant price changes.\n\nIn summary, tariffs (A) result in higher domestic prices, while quotas (C) do not necessarily affect domestic prices.",

This happens because the government needs to borrow more money to finance its increased spending, which in turn increases the demand for loans and bonds. As a result, interest rates rise to attract more investors to lend their money.\n\nIn this case, the crowding-out effect is caused by expansionary monetary policy (increase in the money supply), not fiscal policy.
