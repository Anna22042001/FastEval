            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The question is about the blood flow between contractions of the left ventricle.\n2. The left ventricle is responsible for pumping blood into the aorta and other major arteries.\n3. When the left ventricle contracts, it pushes blood into the aorta and other arteries.\n4. During the relaxation phase of the left ventricle, the blood continues to flow through the vessels.\n5. The primary reason for this continuous flow is the elastic recoil of the arteries.\n6. Elastic recoil allows the arteries to expand and store energy during the contraction of the left ventricle.\n7. When the left ventricle relaxes, the arteries release this stored energy, causing the blood to continue flowing through the vessels.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.",

            "model_answer": "Graves Disease of the thyroid is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism.\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: True. Graves Disease can cause a condition called Graves' ophthalmopathy, which affects the muscles and tissues around the eyes, leading to eye irritation, redness, and in some cases, double vision.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: False. Graves Disease does not typically cause a large multi-nodular goitre. Instead, it usually results in an enlarged thyroid gland called a diffuse goiter.\n\n(C) It is commoner in females than males: True. Graves Disease is more common in females than males, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 7:1.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': True. In the past, Graves Disease was sometimes referred to as \"Derbyshire Neck\" due to the swelling and enlargement of the thyroid gland, which could cause a distinctive appearance of the neck.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "model_answer": "A muscle fibre relaxes when:\n\n(A) the nerve stimulus is removed.\n\nExplanation:\nMuscle fibres contract when they receive a nerve stimulus, which causes the release of calcium ions. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the calcium ions are no longer released, and the muscle fibre relaxes. This is because the actin binding sites are uncovered (C), allowing the actin filaments to slide past the myosin filaments, which leads to muscle relaxation.",

            "model_answer": "The fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is:\n\n(C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nReasoning:\nHigh intensity exercise requires a significant amount of energy to maintain muscle contractions and other physiological processes. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency used by cells for these processes. When the demand for ATP increases during high intensity exercise, the cell's ability to produce ATP through aerobic and anaerobic pathways may not be able to keep up with the increased demand. This imbalance between ATP supply and demand leads to fatigue, as the cells are unable to maintain the required energy levels for sustained high intensity exercise.",

            "model_answer": "Several neurotransmitters have been implicated in fatigue development, and pharmacological agents can alter their levels in the brain. However, the question asks for a specific alteration in neurotransmitters by pharmacological agents.\n\n(A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline are both involved in arousal and alertness. Pharmacological agents that increase acetylcholine levels, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, can help improve cognitive function and reduce fatigue. Noradrenaline, a catecholamine, is also involved in alertness and attention. Pharmacological agents that increase noradrenaline levels, such as modafinil, can help reduce fatigue.\n\n(B) Dopamine is involved in motivation, reward, and attention. Pharmamacological agents that increase dopamine levels, such as amphetamines, can help reduce fatigue. However, these agents can also lead to side effects like addiction and dependence.\n\n(C) Glutamate is involved in cognitive processes, learning, and memory. Pharmacological agents that increase glutamate levels, such as NMDA receptor agonists, can help improve cognitive function and reduce fatigue.\n\n(D) Serotonin is involved in mood regulation, sleep, and appetite. Pharmacological agents that increase serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can help improve mood and reduce fatigue.\n\nIn conclusion, pharmacological agents can alter the levels of acetyl choline, noradrenaline, dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin in the brain, which can influence fatigue development. However, the question asks for a specific alteration, and the most relevant answer is:\n\n(A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.",

            "model_answer": "To determine how long it may take for any pressure damage to be visible, we need to consider the time it takes for the pressure to cause damage and the time it takes for the damage to become visible.\n\nStep 1: Consider the time it takes for the pressure to cause damage.\nPressure damage occurs when the pressure applied to the skin is greater than the skin's ability to withstand it. The time it takes for this damage to occur depends on the intensity of the pressure and the duration of the pressure.\n\nStep 2: Consider the time it takes for the damage to become visible.\nOnce the damage is caused, it takes time for the body to react and for the visible signs of damage to appear. This time depends on the individual's skin condition, the severity of the damage, and the body's healing process.\n\nStep 3: Combine the time for damage to occur and the time for damage to become visible.\nSince we don't have specific information about the individual's skin condition, the severity of the damage, or the body's healing process, we cannot accurately determine the exact time it takes for any pressure damage to be visible.\n\nHowever, considering the given options, we can make an educated guess. Since the patient has been on the operating table for four hours, it is likely that the pressure has been applied for a significant amount of time. Therefore, we can choose the option that represents the shortest time for damage to become visible.\n\nAnswer: (C) 24 hours.",

However, I can provide some general information about phosphocreatine resynthesis.\n\nPhosphocreatine (PCr) is a high-energy compound found in muscle cells. It plays a crucial role in providing energy for short, intense bursts of activity, such as sprinting or weightlifting. During these activities, PCr is rapidly depleted, and its resynthesis process begins to restore its levels.\n\nThe rate of PCr resynthesis depends on various factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise, the individual's fitness level, and the availability of creatine and ATP. Generally, the resynthesis process is faster during rest periods between bouts of high-intensity exercise, as the body has more time to replenish PCr stores.\n\nIn summary, the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise normally takes:\n\n(B) about 30 seconds.",
