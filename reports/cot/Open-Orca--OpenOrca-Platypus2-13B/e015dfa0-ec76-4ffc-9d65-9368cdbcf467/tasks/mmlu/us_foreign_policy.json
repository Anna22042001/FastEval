            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n\nCountries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market because the costs of free trade are often concentrated, meaning they affect a smaller number of firms or industries more significantly. These costs can include job losses, wage reductions, and increased competition. On the other hand, the benefits of free trade are more dispersed, meaning they are experienced by a larger number of people, but not necessarily in a significant way.\n\nGovernments may prioritize the protection of their domestic industries and workers, even if it means limiting the overall economic growth and development of their country. This is because the costs of free trade are often more visible and immediate, while the benefits are more diffuse and long-term. As a result, policymakers may feel compelled to intervene in order to mitigate the negative impacts on specific industries and workers.",

            "question": "How did World War I shift economic power from Europe to the United States?\n\n(A) The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States\n(B) The United States seized German resources after the war\n(C) European countries paid the United States for assistance\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States primarily due to the following reasons:\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nDuring World War I, the United States remained neutral for the majority of the conflict. However, when the United States entered the war in 1917, it provided significant financial and material support to the Allied powers, particularly the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. These countries needed to purchase goods and services from the United States to sustain their war efforts.\n\nAs a result, the United States experienced a significant increase in its manufacturing and industrial output, which led to a surge in its economy. Additionally, the United States was able to sell its products and services to European countries at higher prices due to the increased demand caused by the war.\n\nFurthermore, the United States played a crucial role in financing the war efforts of the Allied powers. European countries borrowed large sums of money from the United States to fund their war expenditures. This allowed the United States to accumulate a substantial amount of foreign debt, which further strengthened its economic position.\n\nAfter the war, the United States was in a strong position to dictate the terms of the peace treaties and the reparations that Germany and other defeated nations had to pay. This further solidified the United States' economic power and its status as a global financial center.\n\nIn summary, World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States due to the United States' role as a creditor country and financial center, as well as the increased demand for its goods and services during the war.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government\n\nAmerican exceptionalism, which is the belief that the United States is unique and superior in its values, institutions, and history, might lead to opposition to world government for several reasons. One primary reason is its general anti-statism, which means the United States tends to be skeptical of centralized government power. This skepticism could make American citizens and policymakers more reluctant to support a world government, as they might view it as an overly powerful and intrusive entity that could threaten their nation's sovereignty and individual liberties.\n\n(B) It views world government as impractical\n\nAnother reason American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to world government is that some Americans might view it as impractical or unrealistic. They might believe that the complexities and diversity of the world's nations make it difficult to establish a single, unified global government that can effectively address global challenges.\n\n(C) It views the UN as a sufficient form of global governance\n\nWhile American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to world government, it's important to note that some Americans might view the United Nations as a sufficient form of global governance. In this case, they might not see the need for a more centralized world government, as they believe the UN can effectively address global issues through its existing structures and institutions.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary reason American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to world government is its general anti-statism, which makes many Americans skeptical of centralized government power. However, other factors, such as the perceived impracticality of world government or the belief that the UN is sufficient, could also contribute to this opposition.",
