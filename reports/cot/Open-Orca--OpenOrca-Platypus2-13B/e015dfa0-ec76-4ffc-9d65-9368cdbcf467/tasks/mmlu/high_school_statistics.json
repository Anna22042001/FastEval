            "model_answer": "(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n\nHere's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The average donation is $155, so we know that half of the donations are more than $155 and half are less than $155.\n2. The standard deviation is $32, which means that 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean (average).\n3. To find the range of donations that are within one standard deviation of the mean, we add and subtract the standard deviation from the mean: $155 \u00b1 32 = $123 to $187.\n4. Since 68% of the data falls within this range, we can subtract 68% from 100% to find the percentage of data that falls outside this range: 100% - 68% = 32%.\n5. To find the lower limit of the range that represents 95% of the data, we add 1.5 times the standard deviation to the mean: $155 + 1.5 * 32 = $187.\n6. To find the upper limit of the range that represents 95% of the data, we add 1.5 times the standard deviation to the mean: $155 + 1.5 * 32 = $219.\n7. The range of donations that represents 95% of the data is between $187 and $219.\n\nSo, the most appropriate statement is (C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.",

            "question": "A teacher's union and a school district are negotiating salaries for the coming year. The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn.

It represents the typical or average salary of the professional staff, as it is less affected by extreme values (high or low salaries). Since the teachers want more money and the district is concerned about budget constraints, focusing on the median would help emphasize the need for a fair distribution of salaries among the moderately paid teachers and highly paid administrators.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following statements is false, let's analyze each set and their properties step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's find the median of both sets:\n   - The median of a set is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\n   - For X, the median is 45 (since there are 6 numbers and 45 is the 3rd one).\n   - For Y, the median is also 45 (since there are 6 numbers and 45 is the 3rd one).\n\n2. Now, let's find the means (averages) of both sets:\n   - The mean of a set is the sum of all numbers divided by the number of elements.\n   - For X, the mean is (10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90) / 6 = 250 / 6 \u2248 41.67\n   - For Y, the mean is (10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90) / 6 = 250 / 6 \u2248 41.67\n\n3. Comparing the means of both sets:\n   - The means of both sets are equal (approximately 41.67).\n\n4. Next, let's find the ranges of both sets:\n   - The range of a set is the difference between the largest and smallest numbers.\n   - For X, the range is 90 - 10 = 80\n   - For Y, the range is 90 - 10 = 80\n\n5.

In order to use a \u03c72 procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.\nThis statement is true. The \u03c72 test is a non-parametric test used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables.

In order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\nThis statement is also true. Degrees of freedom (DF) is a measure of the number of independent variables in a statistical model. In the context of the \u03c72 test, it refers to the number of cells in the table minus 1. Since the \u03c72 test is used for two-way tables, there must be at least 2 independent variables (cells) for the test to be applicable.\n\nIII. In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.\nThis statement is false. In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, there are 4 independent variables (cells) in the table.
