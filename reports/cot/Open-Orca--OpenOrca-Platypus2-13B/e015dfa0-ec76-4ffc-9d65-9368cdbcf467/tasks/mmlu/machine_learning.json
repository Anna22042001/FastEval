If the weights are randomly initialized, there is a higher chance of underfitting, as the model might not be able to capture the complex patterns in the data. On the other hand, if the weights are initialized with some prior knowledge or heuristics, there is a higher chance of overfitting, as the model might be too sensitive to the specific details of the training data.\n\nThe other options, (A) the number of hidden nodes, (B) the learning rate, and (D) the use of a constant-term unit input, also have an impact on the model's performance, but they are more related to the model's complexity and generalization ability rather than the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.",
