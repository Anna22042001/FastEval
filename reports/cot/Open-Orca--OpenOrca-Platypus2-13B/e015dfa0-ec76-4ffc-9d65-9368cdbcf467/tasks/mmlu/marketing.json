            "question": "AIDA stands for awareness, ________, desire and _________.\n\n(A) Interest; action.\n(B) Intensity; appeal.\n(C) Involvement; action.\n(D) Involvement; appeal.",

            "model_answer": "To find the correct answer, let's analyze each step of the AIDA model:\n\n1. Awareness: This step involves making people aware of a product, service, or idea.\n2. Interest: This step focuses on generating curiosity and piquing the interest of the audience.\n3. Desire: This step aims to create a desire or need for the product, service, or idea.\n4. Action: This step encourages the audience to take action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a service.\n\nNow, let's compare the given options:\n\n(A) Interest; action.\n(B) Intensity; appeal.\n(C) Involvement; action.\n(D) Involvement; appeal.\n\nComparing the options with the steps of the AIDA model, we can see that:\n\n(A) Interest; action: This option matches the second and fourth steps of the AIDA model (Interest and Action).\n(B) Intensity; appeal: This option doesn't match any of the steps in the AIDA model.\n(C) Involvement; action: This option matches the third and fourth steps of the AIDA model (Desire and Action).\n(D) Involvement; appeal: This option matches the third and fourth steps of the AIDA model (Desire and Action).\n\nBoth (C) and (D) are valid options, as they both match the third and fourth steps of the AIDA model. However, since the question asks for the complete acronym, we need to choose the option that matches the second step as well.\n\n(A) Interest; action: This option matches the second and fourth steps of the AIDA model (Interest and Action).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(A) Interest; action.",
