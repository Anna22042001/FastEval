How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",

            "model_answer": "To determine how the two stars will appear to your eyes, we need to consider the angular separation and the angular resolution of your eyes.\n\n1. Angular separation: This is the physical distance between the two stars as seen from your eyes.\n2. Angular resolution: This is the smallest angle your eyes can distinguish between two distinct points of light.\n\nNow, let's compare the angular separation and the angular resolution:\n\nIf the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution, it means that your eyes cannot distinguish the two stars as separate objects. In this case, the two stars will appear as a single point of light.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

The combination of a partially molten metallic core and the rapid rotation of Earth creates a dynamo effect, which generates and maintains the strong magnetic field. The other factors mentioned, such as size (A) and volcanic activity (B), do not directly contribute to the strength of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",
