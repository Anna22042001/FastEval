            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for:\n\n(A) Placebo effect\n\nReasoning:\nRandomization helps to ensure that the study subjects are allocated to treatment groups in a way that minimizes systematic differences between the groups. This is particularly important for controlling the placebo effect, as it helps to balance the expectations and experiences of participants in the control and treatment groups.\n\nWhile randomization can also help control for recall bias and non-compliance to some extent, it is primarily designed to control for the placebo effect.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(A) Placebo effect",

            "model_answer": "The papilloma family of viruses, specifically the human papillomavirus (HPV), causes cancer primarily through a combination of (A) and (C).\n\n(A) Replicate in dividing cells and encodes three oncogenic proteins E5, E6, and E7: HPV replicates in dividing cells and encodes three oncogenic proteins, E5, E6, and E7. These proteins can interfere with the normal cell cycle and promote cell growth, leading to the development of cancer.\n\n(C) Has an oncogene able to initiate cancer: The E6 protein of HPV is an oncogene that can initiate cancer. It binds to and inactivates the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which normally helps to prevent the development of cancer by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (cell death) in response to DNA damage. By inactivating p53, E6 allows damaged cells to continue dividing and accumulate mutations, eventually leading to cancer.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) and (C).",
