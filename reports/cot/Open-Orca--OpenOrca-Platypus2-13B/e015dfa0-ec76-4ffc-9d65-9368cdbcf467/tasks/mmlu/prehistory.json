            "model_answer": "The Levallois technology involved a shift in emphasis from:\n\n(A) producing core tools to producing flakes.\n\nReasoning:\nThe Levallois technique is a method of making stone tools that focuses on the production of flakes rather than core tools. This technique involves the reduction of a large stone core into smaller, more useful flakes, which can then be further shaped into tools. So, the correct answer is (A).",

It was a brief cold snap at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, which led to a temporary cooling and expansion of glaciers.
