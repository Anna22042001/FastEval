It is not required for PCR.\n(B) A vacuum chamber is not needed for PCR, as the process can be performed in a standard laboratory environment.\n(D) DNA ligase is used for joining DNA fragments together, but it is not required for PCR, as the process relies on the enzyme DNA polymerase to synthesize new strands of DNA.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA.",

When the blood pH decreases, the hemoglobin molecule becomes more acidic, causing it to preferentially bind to CO2 over O2. This leads to a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for O2.\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

During this process, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, leading to new combinations of alleles in the offspring. This results in increased genetic variation among the offspring.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) the chance for variation in zygotes.",
