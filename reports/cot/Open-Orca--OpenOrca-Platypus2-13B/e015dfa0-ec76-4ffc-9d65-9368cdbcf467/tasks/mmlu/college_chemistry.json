            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nExplanation:\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image, which means that the arrangement of atoms or groups in the molecule is not identical to its mirror image. In complexes containing achiral ligands, the ligands themselves are not responsible for the optical isomerism. Instead, the optical isomerism arises from the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion.\n\nFor linear complexes, the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion can lead to optical isomerism even if both ligands are different. This is because the ligands can be arranged in different ways around the central metal ion, resulting in non-superimposable mirror images.\n\nIn summary, linear complexes with different ligands can display optical isomerism, while square planar complexes require identical ligands, tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism, and octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands need at least three different ligands to display optical isomerism.",

We know that the mixture contains DMSO and AN, and the relative intensities are \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, respectively.\n2. Since the total intensity of the lines is the sum of the individual intensities, we can write the equation: \u03b1 + 3\u03b1 = 1 (since the total intensity is 1).\n3. To find the ratio of the two concentrations, we can divide the total intensity by the sum of the individual intensities:\n   [DMSO]:[AN] = (\u03b1 + 3\u03b1) / (\u03b1 + 3\u03b1)\n4.
