            "question": "The amount and composition of dietary fat are important factors for influencing blood lipid metabolism. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nExplanation:\nIn this case, the statement is correct. Replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to reduce plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, can be converted into anti-inflammatory compounds that help lower triglyceride levels.\n\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nExplanation:\nThis statement is incorrect. Replacing saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is generally associated with a decrease in LDL cholesterol. Monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, can help lower LDL cholesterol levels by reducing the production of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the liver.\n\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nExplanation:\nThis statement is incorrect. Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol. Soluble fibre can bind to cholesterol in the intestine, preventing its absorption, while plant stanols/sterols can block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine, leading to lower LDL cholesterol levels.\n\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nExplanation:\nThis statement is incorrect. Replacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with increased plasma triglyceride concentrations and decreased LDL cholesterol levels. When carbohydrates are consumed in large amounts, they can be converted into glucose and stored as glycogen in the liver. This can lead to an increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations. Additionally, replacing saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates can lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, as carbohydrates can compete with fatty acids for absorption in the intestine.",

The headspace in canned food is not specifically designed to maintain high oxygen levels to preserve vitamin C. The primary purpose of the headspace is to prevent the growth of microorganisms and maintain the food's quality.\n\n(B) Reheating canned vegetables before serving only causes small losses of vitamin C.\nThis statement is not correct. Reheating canned vegetables can lead to significant losses of vitamin C, as the high temperatures can cause the breakdown of the vitamin.\n\n(C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables.\nThis statement is not correct. While it is true that canned fruits generally have higher levels of vitamin C than canned vegetables, the statement does not address the losses of vitamin C during canning and storage.\n\n(D) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small.\nThis statement is correct. During storage at ambient temperature, losses of vitamin C in canned foods are generally small, as the canning process helps preserve the vitamin. However, it is important to note that reheating canned foods can lead to significant losses of vitamin C.\n\nSo, the correct statement is (D).",
