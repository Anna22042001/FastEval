            "model_answer": "The competitive market provides the best outcome for society because:\n\n(B) the total welfare is maximized.\n\nIn a competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they have no control over the price. As a result, the market reaches equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. This equilibrium price is the most efficient one, as it minimizes the wastage of resources (consumer and producer surplus) and maximizes the overall well-being of society.",

            "question": "Suppose the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare. What would you expect to occur in the market for daycare services?\n\n(A) The demand for daycare falls, lowering the market price.\n(B) The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n(C) The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n(D) The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To analyze the impact of the county government sending coupons to parents for daycare subsidies, let's consider the effects on demand and supply:\n\n1. Demand: The demand for daycare services would likely increase due to the subsidy. Parents who previously couldn't afford daycare or had to pay the full cost would now have a financial incentive to send their children to daycare.\n\n2. Supply: The supply of daycare services would likely increase as well. With more parents using the subsidy, daycare centers would have more customers, leading to higher demand for their services. To meet this increased demand, daycare centers would likely expand their capacity or open new facilities.\n\nNow, let's determine the market outcome:\n\nSince both demand and supply increase due to the subsidy, the market price for daycare services would likely rise.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(D) The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the profit-maximizing decision to shut down for a perfectly competitive firm, we need to analyze the firm's cost structure and the market price.\n\n1. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they cannot influence the market price.\n2. The firm's cost structure consists of fixed costs, variable costs, and total costs.\n3. The firm's total revenue is equal to the market price times the quantity produced and sold.\n4. The firm's profit is equal to the difference between total revenue and total costs.\n5. The firm's total costs consist of fixed costs and variable costs.\n6. The firm's variable costs are a function of the quantity produced and sold.\n7. The firm's fixed costs are constant regardless of the quantity produced and sold.\n8. The firm's minimum average total cost (MATC) occurs when the firm produces the quantity where the average total cost (ATC) is at its lowest point.\n9. The firm's minimum average variable cost (MAVC) occurs when the firm produces the quantity where the average variable cost (AVC) is at its lowest point.\n10. The firm's minimum average total cost (MATC) is always greater than or equal to the minimum average variable cost (MAVC).\n\nNow, let's analyze the different scenarios:\n\n(A) falls below minimum average total cost:\nIn this case, the market price is lower than the minimum average total cost, which means the firm is not making any profit. The firm should continue producing and selling at this price to maximize its profit.\n\n(B) is greater than minimum average variable cost, but lower than minimum average total cost:\nIn this scenario, the market price is between the minimum average variable cost (MAVC) and the minimum average total cost (MATC). Since the firm is already producing at the quantity where the minimum average total cost (MATC) is achieved, the firm should continue producing and selling at this price to maximize its profit.\n\n(C) falls below minimum average variable cost:\nIn this case, the market price is lower than the minimum average variable cost (MAVC), which means the firm is not making any profit. The firm should continue producing and selling at this price to maximize its profit.\n\n(D) is equal to minimum average total cost:\nIn this scenario, the market price is equal to the minimum average total cost (MATC). Since the firm is already producing at the quantity where the minimum average total cost (MATC) is achieved, the firm should continue producing and selling at this price to maximize its profit.\n\nIn conclusion, the profit-maximizing decision to shut down for a perfectly competitive firm is made when the price:\n\n(A) falls below minimum average total cost.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To explain how a price decrease might cause a decrease in quantity demanded and an upward-sloping demand curve, we need to consider the relationship between the price of a good, the income effect, and the substitution effect.\n\n(A) The good is inferior and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect:\nIn this case, the good is inferior, meaning it is not as desirable as other goods. When the price of the inferior good decreases, the income effect becomes stronger. The income effect refers to the change in the purchasing power of money due to a change in the price of the good. If the income effect is stronger, it means that the decrease in the price of the inferior good will lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. This will cause consumers to demand fewer units of the inferior good, as they can now afford to buy more of other goods.\n\n(B) The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect:\nIn this case, the good is normal, meaning it is neither inferior nor superior to other goods. When the price of the normal good decreases, the income effect becomes stronger. As a result, consumers will have more purchasing power due to the decrease in the price of the good. However, the substitution effect is weaker, meaning that consumers are less likely to switch to other goods when the price of the normal good decreases. This means that the decrease in the price of the normal good will lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded for the good, as consumers will still prefer to buy more of the normal good due to the stronger income effect.\n\n(C) The good is normal and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect:\nIn this case, the good is normal, and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect. When the price of the normal good decreases, the income effect becomes weaker. As a result, consumers will have more purchasing power due to the decrease in the price of the good. However, the substitution effect is stronger, meaning that consumers are more likely to switch to other goods when the price of the normal good decreases. This means that the decrease in the price of the normal good will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded for the good, as consumers will prefer to buy more of other goods due to the stronger substitution effect.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is (B) The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect. This explains how a price decrease might cause a decrease in quantity demanded and an upward-sloping demand curve for a normal good.",

Let's analyze each characteristic and determine which ones are shared by both market structures:\n\n(A) Ease of entry and exit in the long run:\nIn both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, there is ease of entry and exit in the long run. This means that new firms can enter the market and existing firms can leave the market without any significant barriers.\n\n(B) Homogenous products:\nIn both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, firms produce homogenous products. This means that the products offered by different firms are essentially the same, and consumers cannot differentiate between them based on the product itself.\n\n(C) Perfectly elastic demand for the firm's product:\nIn both perfect competition and monopolistic competition, the demand for the firm's product is perfectly elastic.

Generally, the more elastic the supply, the larger the change in quantity supplied for a given change in price.\n\nWhen producers are operating near the limits of their production, they have less room to adjust their production levels in response to price changes.
