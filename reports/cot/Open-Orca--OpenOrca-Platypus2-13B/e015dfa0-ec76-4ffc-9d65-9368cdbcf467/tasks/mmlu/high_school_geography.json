            "model_answer": "To determine which of these options is least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider their geographical locations and the types of resources they have access to.\n\n(A) United States: The United States is a large country with diverse geography, including various types of natural resources. It has access to oil, natural gas, coal, minerals, and other resources needed for modern industry.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is an island nation with limited natural resources. However, it has access to some minerals, metals, and energy resources like coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\n(C) France: France is a European country with diverse geography and access to various natural resources. It has access to oil, natural gas, coal, minerals, and other resources needed for modern industry.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom is an island nation with limited natural resources. It has access to some minerals, metals, and energy resources like coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nComparing the options, we can see that both the United States and France have more diverse and abundant natural resources than Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nSo, the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry among these options is:\n\n(D) United Kingdom",

            "model_answer": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as:\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n\nReasoning:\nContagious diffusion is the most appropriate process for the spread of a new fashion design globally. This is because it involves the rapid spread of information and trends through social networks and interpersonal connections. As people share their experiences and opinions about the new design, it quickly gains popularity and spreads across different regions and cultures.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n\nThis statement is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, also known as the \"Cumulative Causation Model,\" focuses on the interconnectedness and mutual reinforcement of various factors that contribute to economic growth and development. It emphasizes the idea that initial advantages can lead to further advantages, creating a cycle of growth and development.\n\nThe statement (A) suggests that wealth is shared equally between developed and developing regions through trade, which does not align with the core concept of cumulative causation. The theory focuses on the accumulation of advantages and their reinforcing effects, rather than equal distribution of wealth.",

Primary activities: Many periphery countries are rich in natural resources, and their economies rely heavily on agriculture, mining, and fishing.\n2. Secondary activities: While some periphery countries have manufacturing industries, they are not as dominant as primary activities.\n3. Tertiary activities: These services are essential in any economy, but they are not the primary source of employment in periphery countries.\n4.
