            "model_answer": "To determine if a reaction is spontaneous, we need to look at the signs of the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) and the equilibrium constant (Keq).\n\nStep 1:\nA spontaneous reaction is one that proceeds in the direction that increases the total entropy (S) of the system. This is indicated by a positive value of \u0394S\u00b0 (change in entropy) for the reaction.\n\nStep 2:\nA spontaneous reaction will have a positive \u0394G\u00b0 (change in Gibbs free energy) at equilibrium. This is because the reaction will proceed in the direction that increases the total entropy (S) of the system, and the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) is equal to the change in enthalpy (\u0394H) minus the change in entropy (\u0394S).\n\nStep 3:\nA spontaneous reaction will have a Keq (equilibrium constant) greater than one.
