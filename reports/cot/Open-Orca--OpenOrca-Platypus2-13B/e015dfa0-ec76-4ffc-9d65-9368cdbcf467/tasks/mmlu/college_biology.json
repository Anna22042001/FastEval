            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face (closest to the endoplasmic reticulum) faces the cell's periphery, while its trans face (closest to the cell membrane) faces the center of the cell. This arrangement allows for the efficient transport of proteins and lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.\n\n(B) It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is involved in the modification and packaging of proteins and lipids for secretion or incorporation into the cell membrane. Small secretory vesicles containing these molecules are typically found near the cis face of the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse with the cis face of the Golgi apparatus to release their contents into the lumen.\n\n(C) Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is composed of a series of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae. These cisternae are continuous with one another, forming a continuous structure that allows for the efficient transport of materials through the Golgi apparatus.\n\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is involved in the modification of proteins and lipids, including the addition of sugar molecules (glycosylation) to certain secretory proteins. This process occurs before the proteins enter the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, ensuring that the glycosylated proteins are properly sorted and packaged for their final destinations.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
