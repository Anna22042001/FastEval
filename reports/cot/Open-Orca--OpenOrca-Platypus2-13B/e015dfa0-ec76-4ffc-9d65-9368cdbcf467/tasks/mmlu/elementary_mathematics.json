            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is true, let's analyze the given information:\n\n1. The distance between Miriam's house and Debbie's house is 444.44 meters.\n2. The given distance has a decimal representation: 444.44.\n3. The decimal representation has three digits: 4, 4, and 4.\n\nNow, let's examine each statement:\n\n(A) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.\nSince the tenths place has a 4 and the tens place has a 4, we can compare their values:\n4 (tenths) = 1/10 * 4 (tens)\n\nCalculating the product:\n4 (tenths) = 1/10 * 4 (tens) = 0.4 * 4 (tens) = 1.6\n\nSo, the value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1.6 times greater than the value of the 4 in the tens place. This contradicts statement (A).\n\n(B) The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nSince the hundredths place has a 4 and the ones place has a 4, we can compare their values:\n4 (hundredths) = 1/10 * 4 (ones)\n\nCalculating the product:\n4 (hundredths) = 1/10 * 4 (ones) = 0.4 * 4 (ones) = 1.6\n\nSo, the value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1.6 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place. This contradicts statement (B).\n\n(C) The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.\nSince the hundreds place has a 4 and the ones place has a 4, we can compare their values:\n4 (hundreds) = 10 * 4 (ones)\n\nCalculating the product:\n4 (hundreds) = 10 * 4 (ones) = 40\n\nSo, the value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place. This supports statement (C).\n\n(D) The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.\nSince the tenths place has a 4 and the hundredths place has a 4, we can compare their values:\n4 (tenths) = 10 * 4 (hundredths)\n\nCalculating the product:\n4 (tenths) = 10 * 4 (hundredths) = 40\n\nSo, the value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place. This supports statement (D).\n\nNow, we need to determine which statement is true. Comparing the statements, we can see that both (C) and (D) are supported by the given information. However, (A) and (B) are contradicted by the given information.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
