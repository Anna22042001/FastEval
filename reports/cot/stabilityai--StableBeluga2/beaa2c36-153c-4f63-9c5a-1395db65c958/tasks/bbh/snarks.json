In statement A, the wheel is wobbling millimeters, while in statement B, the wheel is wobbling feet.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sarcastic statement\nA wheel wobbling several feet in either direction would be a significant issue and would likely suggest that the bike is unsafe.

The phrase \"Yeah, no one is rewatching\" is not sarcastic in this context because it doesn't make sense to say that no one is rewatching a highly successful movie.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
