            "model_answer": "(A) Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\n\nFirst, we should understand what sarcasm means. Sarcasm is a form of communication where a speaker says one thing while meaning the opposite, usually in a humorous way.\n\nConsidering the two options:\n(A) Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\n(B) Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\n\nBoth options are similar in the message they convey. The main differences are the words \"then\" and \"that.\" The use of the word \"then\" in option (A) suggests a logical flow or a change in the speaker's tone. In contrast, option (B) simply rephrases the idea using the word \"that\" without changing the tone or the logical flow of the statement.\n\nConsidering this, the sarcastic statement is option (A) because it appears to mock or make fun of the idea that simply being happy can help someone to overcome depression. It's sarcastic because it oversimplifies a complex mental state by suggesting that it can be solved with a simple change in emotion.",

This statement acknowledges that racism is a toxic subject, and implies that making jokes about it further contributes to its toxicity.\n\nBased on the contrast in tone and approach between the two statements, I determine that the (A) option implies a meme about racism being okay when it isn't, making it the sarcastic statement.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

However, urging might be less forceful than threatening. \n- In (B), we compare threatening to pleading, which have different meanings. Threatening is forceful while pleading is often more emotional and less forceful.\n\nWe can see that option (A) is more closely related, and there's very little difference between threatening and urging, while option (B) highlights a starker contrast, providing a more sarcastic tone.\n\nSo the sarcastic statement is (B).\nThe final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else - (B).",

Plastic containers, on the other hand, are a more common and familiar choice in takeout meals.\n\nStatement A refers to an out-of-the-ordinary experience, making it less likely to be sarcastic.\nStatement B refers to a relatively common experience, making it more likely to be sarcastic.\n\nApplying Reasoning:\nAs the hardwood containers are not a common occurrence in the context of takeout meals, it is less likely to be sarcastic.

Printers are generally considered simple devices, and most users can understand how to operate them without any difficulty.

It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game\n- Winter weather is usually cold, and during the first week of winter, it would be normal to expect it to take some time to warm up. This statement aligns with a common belief.\n\n(B) You're right, it's the last week of winter! It will definitely get warmer in a couple weeks for our first playoff game\n- Winter weather is usually cold, and during the last week of winter, it would be normal to expect that the cold weather is about to change. However, this statement claims that it will take a couple of weeks for the weather to get warmer, suggesting a more extended period of cold weather during the transition from winter to spring. This statement does not align with a typical expectation and seems to contradict the natural progression of seasons.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is (B) You're right, it's the last week of winter!

Sarcasm is a form of irony that is meant to convey the opposite of its literal meaning through humor, mockery, or disbelief. Let's examine the two options:\n\n(A) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be easy\nThis statement appears to be genuinely concerned about the difficulty of the task. It's not mocking or expressing disbelief in the idea of an illegal action.\n\n(B) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal\nThis statement seems to imply that the action will be illegal. The word \"illegal\" is used sarcastically because it is the opposite of its literal meaning.\n\nHence, the sarcastic statement is option (B). The final answer is:\n\n(B)",

There's no hidden mocking or humor in this statement, so by itself, it does not seem to be sarcastic.\n\nStatement (B):\n(B) Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago.\n\nThis statement implies that, considering the minimal period of just eight days, it is a good thing that prices haven't increased. However, there is a sarcastic undertone because it's evident that prices can change significantly even within a short period of time, so the gratitude expressed in the statement is ironic and mocking.\n\nAnswer: (B)",
