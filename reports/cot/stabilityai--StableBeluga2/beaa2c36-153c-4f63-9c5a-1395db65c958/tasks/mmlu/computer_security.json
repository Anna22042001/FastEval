Without file descriptor passing, it would still be possible for okd to run as a non-root user.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To understand how a buffer overflow on the stack facilitates running attacker-injected code, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code\n- A buffer overflow on the stack can overwrite the return address on the stack, which is the address the program will jump to once a function call is complete. If the return address is overwritten with the address of the attacker-injected code, the program will jump to that code instead of continuing with its normal execution. This allows the attacker-injected code to run.\n\n(B) By writing directly to the instruction pointer register the address of the code\n- The instruction pointer register (IP) holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. Writing directly to the IP register with the address of the attacker-injected code would cause the program to jump to that code instead of continuing with its normal execution. However, this option is not related to a buffer overflow on the stack.\n\n(C) By writing directly to %eax the address of the code\n- The %eax register is a general-purpose register used for various purposes, including holding the address of data or code. Writing directly to %eax with the address of the attacker-injected code would not cause the program to jump to that code, as the program would still continue executing from its current location.\n\n(D) By changing the name of the running executable, stored on the stack\n- The name of the running executable is not stored on the stack, and changing it would not facilitate running attacker-injected code.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code",
