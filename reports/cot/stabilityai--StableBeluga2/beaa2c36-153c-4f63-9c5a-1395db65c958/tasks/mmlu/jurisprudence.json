In what way?\n\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n(C) It is taken literally.\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understanding the aphorism\nMaine proposes that the progression of societies has transitioned from Status to Contract. Under status, individuals are subject to their position in a social hierarchy, while under contract, individuals have more autonomy and self-determination through negotiated agreements.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the options\n(A) It is misinterpreted as a prediction.\nThis option suggests that the aphorism may be misunderstood as a prediction rather than a description of historical progression.\n\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\nThis option implies that the way Maine's concept of status is misunderstood, potentially leading to confusion about the aphorism.\n\n(C) It is taken literally.\nThe aphorism implies a general historical trend; taking it literally might miss the broader theoretical perspective.\n\n(D) His idea is considered inapplicable to Western legal systems.\nThis possibility highlights the misinterpretation that the aphorism is not relevant to Western laws and societies.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating the options against the question\nTo answer the question, we need to assess which option best explains how Maine's aphorism is misunderstood.\n\nOption (A) discusses misinterpretation as a prediction but does not directly address the aphorism.\nOption (B) implies misrepresentation of Maine's concept of status, which could cause misunderstanding of the aphorism.\nOption (C) is a closer fit as taking the aphorism literally could lead to misinterpretation of its broader meaning and implications.\nOption (D) is not directly in line with the question, as it focuses on inapplicability to Western legal systems rather than misunderstanding the aphorism.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the best answer to the question is:\n\n(C) It is taken literally.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the factors\n\n- (A) Depression of the 1930s: This period saw the economies collapse leading to a massive decline in the living standards worldwide.\n- (B) The Rise of Fascism: This movement gained power in 1920-30s, and led to the introduction of authoritarian, anti-democratic, and anti-communist regimes in several countries like Italy, Germany, and Spain.\n- (C) The International Recognition of Human Rights after World War II: This aspect focused on the protection of fundamental human rights for all individuals, regardless of their nationality, race, gender, religion, or political beliefs.\n- (D) The Bolshevik Revolution: This referred to the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government in 1917, leading to the establishment of the Soviet Union.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate which factors are relevant to the revival of natural law\n\nNatural law is based on a set of principles inherent in human nature and would address human rights, morality, and justice.\n\nBased on these principles, we can infer that options (A), (B), and (D) are unrelated to the revival of natural law as they focus on political, economic, and social events.\n\nStep 3: Identify the factor related to the revival of natural law\n\nOption (C) - The international recognition of human rights after World War II - addresses the protection of human rights, which is closely tied with natural law principles. This was a significant factor that contributed to the revival of natural law in the 20th century, as it reestablished a standard of human dignity and respect.\n\nAnswer: (C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II.",

However, it can still be informative to consider the grand and formal styles as potential influences on judges' reasoning.\n\n(D) Judicial reasoning is always formal.\nThis criticism claims that all judicial reasoning should be formal, which is a respectable view but may imply that the grand style does not exist at all. While it is essential for judicial reasoning to be formal and based on facts and legal principles, it's also possible that different styles of reasoning may overlap or coexist.\n\nAfter analyzing the criticisms, the most compelling criticism would be (C) It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way, as it highlights the potential shortcomings of the approach while still accepting that it might provide some insights.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

Social primary goods are defined as goods that promote a fulfilling life, and they include rights, liberties, opportunities, income, and wealth.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options.\n\n(A) The POP will choose wealth over a compassionate society.\n(B) The POP will choose equality over power.\n(C) The POP will be unselfish.\n(D) The POP will choose to protect the disabled.\n\nStep 3: Compare the propositions to the principles of POP.\nOption A: This proposition discusses promoting wealth in society, which aligns with the idea of promoting a fulfilling life. However, it contradicts the spirit of Rawls's theory as it prefers selfishness over fairness.\n\nOption B: This proposition aligns with the principles of POP, as choosing equality over power is consistent with maximizing goals behind the veil of ignorance. Individuals would choose not to be subject to the arbitrary power of those who control social primary goods.\n\nOption C: Although Rawls's theory implies that people should be unselfish, the question is asking about which choice is most consistent with what Rawls claims the POP would opt for. The idea of being unselfish is not explicitly connected to social primary goods in this context.\n\nOption D: Rawls's theory focuses on the principles of fairness when individuals do not know their position in society. Choosing to protect the disabled aligns with the idea of fairness, but it doesn't specify the trade-off related to social primary goods.\n\nStep 4: Choose the proposition that best represents POP in respect to social primary goods.\nGiven the analysis, option B is the most consistent with what Rawls claims the POP would opt for in respect to \"social primary goods.\"\n\nAnswer: (B) The POP will choose equality over power.",
