Therefore, we can eliminate options (A) and (B).\n\nStep 3: Compare the remaining options\nNow we are left with Roman Law and Greek Thinking. The idea of natural law has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly in the works of Aristotle and the Stoics. Roman law, on the other hand, was a legal system developed by the Romans, which was influenced by Greek philosophy but not the origin of the idea of natural law.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct option\nBased on the analysis, the idea of 'natural law' first appeared in Greek Thinking.\n\nAnswer: (D) Greek Thinking",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the \"reasonable person\" standard in tort law.\nThe \"reasonable person\" standard is a legal concept used to determine if a person acted with the appropriate level of care in a given situation. It is an objective standard that compares the person's actions to what a hypothetical reasonable person would do in the same circumstances.\n\nStep 2: Analyze statement (A).\nStatement (A) suggests that the reasonable person standard varies from person to person. This is incorrect, as the standard is objective and not based on individual characteristics.\n\nStep 3: Analyze statement (B).\nStatement (B) claims that the reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's subjective mental state rather than their behavior. This is also incorrect, as the standard is based on the defendant's actions, not their mental state.\n\nStep 4: Analyze statement (C).\nStatement (C) states that a person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability. This is correct, as the standard takes into account any disabilities or limitations a person may have.\n\nStep 5: Analyze statement (D).\nStatement (D) asserts that a person with a mental disability must act as would a person with the same mental disability. This is also correct, as the standard considers any mental disabilities or limitations a person may have.\n\nStep 6: Determine the correct statement.\nBoth statements (C) and (D) are correct concerning the \"reasonable person\" standard in tort law.\n\nAnswer: (C) and (D)",
