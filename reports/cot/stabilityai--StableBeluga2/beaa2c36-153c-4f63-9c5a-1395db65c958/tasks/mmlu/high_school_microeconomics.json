What would you expect to occur in the market for daycare services?\n\n(A) The demand for daycare falls, lowering the market price.\n(B) The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n(C) The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n(D) The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the situation\nThe county government is providing coupons to parents to help subsidize the cost of sending their children to daycare. This means that parents will have to pay less for daycare services.\n\nStep 2: Determine the effect on demand\nWhen the cost of a good or service decreases, people tend to demand more of it. In this case, the subsidy will make daycare services more affordable for parents, so they will be more likely to send their children to daycare.\n\nStep 3: Determine the effect on supply\nThe subsidy does not directly affect the supply of daycare services. The supply will depend on the number of daycare providers and their ability to accommodate more children.\n\nStep 4: Predict the market outcome\nSince the demand for daycare services is expected to rise due to the subsidy, and the supply is not directly affected, we can predict that the market price for daycare services will increase.\n\nAnswer: (B) The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.",
