            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Steps for answering the question:\n\n1. First, identify what the \"rule of thumb\" type of bias means. This is a general guideline or an easily remembered rule that is used in decision making. The term should reflect the use of these simplifying heuristics or shortcuts in the decision-making process.\n\n2. Next, examine each of the given options to determine which best fits the description of \"rule of thumb\" bias.\n\n   (A) Framing bias: This refers to making decisions based on the way information is presented or \"framed.\" It does not involve the use of simplifying heuristics or shortcuts in decision making, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n   (B) Hindsight bias: This is the tendency to believe that an outcome was more predictable than it actually was. It does not involve the use of simplifying heuristics or shortcuts in decision making either, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n   (C) Over-confidence bias: This refers to having an overinflated belief in one's abilities or the accuracy of one's judgment. This is related to decision-making but is not specifically about the use of simplifying rules or shortcuts, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n   (D) Heuristics: Heuristics are mental shortcuts or simplifying guidelines that people use to ease cognitive burden when making decisions. This closely matches the description of a 'rule of thumb' bias.\n\n3. Finally, pick the option that best matches the definition of 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision-making:\n\nAnswer: (D) Heuristics\n\nFinal line: (D)",

He also helped enact welfare reform and supported crime and education bills.\n\nStep 3: Compare their impact\nWhile all four leaders have made significant impacts and implemented changes in their respective domains, each criterion does not appear to be sufficient to eliminate any of them from meeting the criteria of a 'transformational leader.'\n\nTherefore, after examining their roles, it seems that the question is not suited for elimination-based reasoning, so no political leader can be labeled as unable to be termed a 'transformational leader.'\n\nHowever, in order to provide an answer as per the question's format, the 'answer' is:\n\n(D) Bill Clinton",

Understanding the meaning of the term 'Gantt chart':\n   A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule that displays the start and end dates of tasks or events, and their duration. It is often used to manage and monitor the progress of the project. It helps project managers to plan, coordinate, and track specific tasks in a project.\n\n3. Comparing the given options with the concept of Gantt chart:\n   A) Work flow design - This focuses on a smooth transition of work between different people or tasks involved in a process. It is not related to the function of a Gantt chart.\n   B) Work schedule design - This relates to organizing and planning activities within a given timeframe, which is exactly what a Gantt chart does.\n   C) Work rate design - This is about designing and managing the output rates or productivity levels of tasks or workers. While this may be related to a project in general, it's not the main purpose of a Gantt chart.\n   D) Work output design - This involves designing and improving the quality and quantity of work outputs.
