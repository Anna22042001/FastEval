While MSE is a measure of forecast accuracy, trading rule profitability depends on various other factors such as market conditions, trading strategies, and risk management.\n\n(B) Mean absolute error (MAE) does not provide a quadratic loss function. MAE is a linear loss function, as it calculates the absolute difference between the forecasted and actual values without squaring the errors.\n\n(C) Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is indeed a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts. It calculates the average percentage difference between the forecasted and actual values, making it suitable for assessing the accuracy of asset return forecasts.\n\n(D) Mean squared error (MSE) penalizes large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors.
