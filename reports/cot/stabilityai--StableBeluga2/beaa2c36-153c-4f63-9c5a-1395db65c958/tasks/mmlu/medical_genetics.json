In other words, it measures the level of relatedness between individuals in a population.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options\n(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes: Inbreeding leads to an increase in homozygosity, which means there is a higher chance of two identical alleles at a locus.

This could potentially result in a higher proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\n(C) Higher proportion of genes with introns: Introns are non-coding sequences of DNA present in eukaryotic genomes.
