            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the given information\nA whiffle ball is tossed straight up, reaches a highest point, and falls back down. Air resistance is not negligible.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate statement I\nThe ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\n\nSince the ball is tossed straight up and reaches a highest point, it must have a moment when it stops moving upward and changes direction. At this moment, the speed is zero.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate statement II\nThe ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nAcceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Since the ball changes direction at the highest point, its velocity changes from upward to downward. Therefore, the acceleration is not zero at the highest point.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate statement III\nThe ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nAir resistance is not negligible, which means that the ball experiences a force opposing its motion while moving upward. This force slows the ball down, making it take longer to reach the highest point. On the way down, the force of gravity is the only significant force acting on the ball, and air resistance is less significant. Therefore, the ball falls back down faster than it took to go up.\n\nStep 5: Match the evaluated statements with the given options\nOption A: I only - True (the ball's speed is zero at the highest point)\nOption B: II only - False (the ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point)\nOption C: I & II only - False (the ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point)\nOption D: I & III only - True (the ball's speed is zero at the highest point and it takes longer to travel up than to fall back down)\n\nAnswer: (D) I & III only",
