            "model_answer": "Step 1: Estimate the population of the United States.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the population of the United States was approximately 328 million in 2019.\n\nStep 2: Estimate the number of households in the United States.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 128 million households in the United States in 2019.\n\nStep 3: Estimate the number of movies watched per household per year.\nTo estimate this, we can assume that each household watches at least one movie per week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, each household would watch approximately 52 movies per year.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year.\nTo do this, we multiply the number of households (128 million) by the number of movies watched per household per year (52).\n\n128 million households * 52 movies per household = 6.656 billion movies\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated number to the given options.\n6.656 billion movies is closest to option (B) 2,000,000,000. However, the actual number is significantly higher than this option. Therefore, the closest answer is:\n\n(D) 200,000,000,000",

Estimate the amount of ice wasted per person per day.\n3. Calculate the total energy wasted by Americans per day.\n4. Multiply the daily energy waste by the number of days in a year.\n5. Compare the result to the given options and choose the closest one.\n\nStep 1: Estimate the number of Americans who consume drinks with ice daily.\n- Approximately 328 million people live in the United States.\n- Let's assume that 80% of the population consumes drinks with ice daily.\n- 80% of 328 million = 262.4 million Americans\n\nStep 2: Estimate the amount of ice wasted per person per day.\n- Let's assume that each person wastes 10 grams of ice per day.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total energy wasted by Americans per day.\n- The specific heat capacity of ice is 2.03 J/g\u00b0C.\n- The temperature difference between the ice and the surrounding environment is approximately 20\u00b0C.\n- Energy wasted per person per day = mass * specific heat capacity * temperature difference\n- Energy wasted per person per day = 10 g * 2.03 J/g\u00b0C * 20\u00b0C = 406 J\n\nStep 4: Multiply the daily energy waste by the number of days in a year.\n- There are approximately 365 days in a year.\n- Total energy wasted by Americans per year = daily energy waste * number of days\n- Total energy wasted by Americans per year = 406 J * 365 days = 148,490 J\n\nStep 5: Compare the result to the given options and choose the closest one.\n- The closest option to 148,490 J is (A) 6*10^8 J.\n\nAnswer: (A) 6*10^8 J",

Therefore, we can eliminate the Indian elephant, as it is smaller than the African elephant.\n\nStep 3: Consider the habitat\nThe sperm whale and blue whale are both marine animals, which means they live in an environment with less resistance to sound waves. This allows their sounds to travel farther and potentially be louder.\n\nStep 4: Compare the two remaining options\nBoth the sperm whale and blue whale are known for their loud vocalizations, but the blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. Due to its size, it is likely to produce louder sounds than the sperm whale.\n\nAnswer: (C) blue whale",
