Since each can have 5 values, the size of P is:\n\n|P| = 5^8 = 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 55,987,200\n\nStep 2: For each polynomial p(x) in P, the derivative p'(x) is a new polynomial in P with coefficients that are integers in Z_5. This means the image of each polynomial p(x) under the D map, p'(x), belongs to P as well.\n\nStep 3: An important fact is that the degree of p'(x) is one less than the degree of p(x). For example, if p(x) is a constant polynomial, i.e., ax^7 (degree = 7), then p'(x) = 0 (degree = 0). Similarly, if p(x) is linear, i.e., ax^7 + bx^6 (degree = 7 or 6), then p'(x) = b (degree = 6).\n\nStep 4: Since the null space of an operator is the set of all elements in the domain that map to the zero element in the codomain, we count the number of polynomials in P whose derivative is 0. \n\nFor each of the three cases above, if the original polynomial has degree 0, 6, or 7, then its derivative will have degree 0. So 3 out of 8 of the coefficients are \"responsible\" for the null space of the operator D.\n\nStep 5: The dimension of the null space is the number of basis elements that span it. We see that there are 3 basis elements for the null space of D in P, so the dimension of n is n = 3.\n\nStep 6: The range of the operator D is the set of all possible polynomials that p'(x) can take. Since the range is precisely the set of all polynomials in P with degrees less than 7, the dimension of the range is r = 7.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) n = 1 and r = 7",

To better understand the curve, we can graph it as the product of the x-coordinate and y-coordinate equaling 8.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the origin.\nThe origin is the point (0,0) on the coordinate plane.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the shortest distance from the origin to the curve.\nTo do this, we need to figure out the shortest distance from the point (0,0) to the curve xy = 8.\n\nStep 4: Formulate the equation for distance between two points.\nThe geometric distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is the square root of the sum of squares of their x-differences and y-differences (\u221a(x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2). In our case, the two points are (0,0) and (x,y) on the curve xy = 8.\n\nStep 5: Find the value of x and y on the curve.\nTo do this, we set x = 8/y and substitute this value into xy = 8 to find y. Once we have y, we can find the value of x, as well.\n\nx = 8/y, so y = 8/x\nxy = 8\n(8/y) * y = 8\n\n8 = 8\n\nAs we are considering the shortest distance, we will find the point on the curve where the x and y values are equal, because in this case, the point (x, y) on the curve will be the closest to the origin. So, 8/x = y \u21d2 x = 8/y \u21d2 x = y\n\nStep 6: Calculate the distance using the found coordinates.\nNow we return to the equation for geometric distance and substitute the x and y values found from the curve xy = 8, which were both equal to 8/x or 8/y.\n\nDistance = \u221a((x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2) = \u221a((8/x - 0)\u00b2 + (8/x - 0)\u00b2) = \u221a(((8 - 0 \u22c5 x) / x)\u00b2 + ((8 - 0 \u22c5 x) / x)\u00b2) = \u221a(8/x\u00b2)\n\nStep 7: Simplify the distance.\nSince 8/x\u00b2 = 1/x\u00b2, it follows that distance = \u221a(1/x\u00b2) = 1/\u221ax\u00b2.\n\nTo make the next step simpler, we recall that the square root of the inverse of a number (\u221a(1/a\u00b2)) can be written as 1/a (\u221a(1/a\u00b2) = \u221a(a\u207b\u00b2) = a\u207b\u00b9 = 1/a).\n\nSo the distance is 1/\u221ax or 1/\u221a(8/x).\n\nStep 8: Solve numerically.\nTaking the cube root of both sides of 8 = xy, we find that x = 2 (and y = 4).\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can calculate the distance: 1/\u221ax \u21d2 1/\u221a(8/x) \u21d2 1/\u221a(8/2) \u21d2 1/(4) \u21d2 0.25\n\nAt this point, we have found the distance between the origin and the curve xy = 8. The correct answer, therefore, corresponds to the closest choice among the given options.\n\nThe closest option to 0.25 is (B) 8, which is the shortest distance within the choices provided.\n\n(B) 8",

The bottom end of the ladder starts moving away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second. We need to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding down the wall when the top end is 3 meters above the ground.\n\nStep 2: Draw a diagram\nLet's imagine the ground level as the x-axis and the height of the ladder as the y-axis. The length of the ladder is 9 meters, making an angle of 45 degrees with the ground when it's not moving.\n\nStep 3: Understand how the top and bottom ends of the ladder move\nWhen the bottom end of the ladder is moving towards the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, it means that the ladder is making an angle with respect to the ground that is constantly decreasing. This results in the top end of the ladder moving vertically downward along the wall. The motion of the ladder can be seen as a pair of coordinates describing the position of the top of the ladder at any given moment in time.\n\nStep 4: Find the equation of the ladder\nLet's consider the relationship between the horizontal displacement (x) of the bottom end of the ladder and the vertical displacement (y) of the top end of the ladder.\n\nConsider the triangles formed by the ladder and the wall, and think about similar triangles. \nAs the ladder length (9 meters) remains constant and the ladder makes an angle of 45 degrees with the ground when it's not moving, the triangle formed by the ladder and the wall is a 45-45-90 triangle.\n\nIn a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the proportion of 1:1:\u221a(2). Thus,\nx/y = 1/\u221a(2)\n\nStep 5: Find the instantaneous rate of change of the top end of the ladder\nNow we need to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder is sliding down the wall. This will be in terms of the rate at which x is changing (dx/dt) as a continuous function of time.\n\nRecall that the ladder is moving horizontally at 2 meters per second. Thus,\ndx/dt = 2\n\nWe know the relationship between x and y from our calculations in step 4. Since x is changing, y will also change correspondingly.\n\ndy/dt = (dx/dt) * (1/\u221a(2))\ndy/dt = 2 * (1/\u221a(2))\ndy/dt = 2 * 1/\u221a(2)\ndy/dt = 2/\u221a(2)\n\nStep 6: Find the rate of change of y when y = 3\nNow we need to find the instantaneous rate of change of y when its value is 3, i.e., when the top end of the ladder is 3 meters above the ground.\n\nAt that moment, dy/dt = 2/\u221a(2)\n\nStep 7: Write the answer as a fraction and reduce it\n2/\u221a(2) = 12 * \u221a(2) / 12 * \u221a(2) = A\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",
