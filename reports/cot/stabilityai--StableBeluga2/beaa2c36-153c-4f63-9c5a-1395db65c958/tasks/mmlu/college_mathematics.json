P is invertible\nII. P is diagonalizable\nIII. P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation\n\nStep 3: Evaluate statement I\nSince P^2 = P, we can write P as a sum of an invertible matrix and a nilpotent matrix. If P is invertible, then both the invertible matrix and the nilpotent matrix must be invertible. However, a nilpotent matrix is not invertible, so P cannot be invertible.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate statement II\nA matrix is diagonalizable if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the dimension of the matrix. Since P^2 = P, we know that the only possible eigenvalues of P are 0 and 1. If P is diagonalizable, then it must have n linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. However, if P has a non-zero vector v with Pv = v, then P^2v = Pv = v, which means v is also an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. This contradicts the assumption that P has n linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 1. Therefore, P cannot be diagonalizable.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate statement III\nSince P^2 = P, we can write P as a sum of an invertible matrix and a nilpotent matrix. If P is the identity transformation, then the invertible matrix is the identity matrix and the nilpotent matrix is the zero matrix.
