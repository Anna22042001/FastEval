            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the characteristics of physiological arousal.\n\nPhysiological arousal refers to the body's response to a stimulus, which can include various physical changes. In this case, we have four options to consider:\n\n(A) Dilation of the pupils: This occurs when the muscles in the iris contract or relax, changing the size of the pupil to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.\n\n(B) Increase in salivation: This is the production of saliva, which helps in the digestion process and keeps the mouth moist.\n\n(C) Increase in perspiration: This is the production of sweat, which helps regulate body temperature and remove toxins.\n\n(D) Increase in secretion of stress hormones: This refers to the release of hormones like adrenaline and cortisol in response to stress or excitement.\n\nStep 2: Determine which characteristic is NOT related to physiological arousal.\n\nNow, we need to identify which of these options is NOT characteristic of physiological arousal.\n\n(A) Dilation of the pupils: This is a common response to various stimuli, such as changes in light or emotional reactions.\n\n(B) Increase in salivation: This can occur in response to the anticipation of food or other stimuli.\n\n(C) Increase in perspiration: This is a common response to physical exertion, heat, or emotional reactions.\n\n(D) Increase in secretion of stress hormones: This is a typical response to stress or excitement.\n\nStep 3: Choose the option that is NOT characteristic of physiological arousal.\n\nBased on the analysis, the option that is NOT characteristic of physiological arousal is:\n\n(B) Increase in salivation\n\nAnswer: B",

It is not directly related to the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion.\n\n(C) Medulla: The medulla oblongata is responsible for vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. While it is involved in the physiological responses associated with emotions, it is not the primary area responsible for the Cannon-Bard theory.\n\n(D) Association areas: Association areas in the brain, such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex, are involved in processing emotions and linking them to cognitive processes.
