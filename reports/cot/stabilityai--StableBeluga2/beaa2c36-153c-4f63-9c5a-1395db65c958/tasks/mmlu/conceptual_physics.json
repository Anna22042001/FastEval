            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the options\nWe have four options to consider:\n(A) light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\n(B) light passing the Sun is deflected.\n(C) a clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth.\n(D) All of these.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (A)\nGeneral relativity predicts that gravity can slow down time and space. Since light is affected by the space-time fabric, it can be slowed down by gravity.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nGeneral relativity also predicts that massive objects can bend the space-time fabric, causing light to be deflected as it passes by.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nAccording to general relativity, time dilation occurs due to differences in gravity. Since the Sun has a stronger gravitational pull than Earth, a clock on the Sun's surface would run slower than on Earth, not faster.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nOptions (A) and (B) are correct, but option (C) is not. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) All of these.",
