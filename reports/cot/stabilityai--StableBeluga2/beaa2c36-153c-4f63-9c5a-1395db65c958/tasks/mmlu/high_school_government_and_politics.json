Therefore, this statement is false.\n(B) Appellate trials are not jury trials. They are typically heard by a panel of judges who review the legal issues in the case. Therefore, this statement is false.\n(C) Appellate judges do not usually decide the facts of a case. Their primary role is to review the legal issues and ensure that the lower court's decision was based on correct application of the law. Therefore, this statement is false.\n(D) Appellate judges do review decisions of lower courts. This is their primary function, as they ensure that the lower court's decision was based on correct application of the law. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\n(D)",
