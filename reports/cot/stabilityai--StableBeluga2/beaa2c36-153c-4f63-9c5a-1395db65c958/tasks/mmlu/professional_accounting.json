            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem - We need to find the estimated yearly yield on an investment in a limousine that is rented out for events at the rate of $245 per hour on average for 2 hours a day. The daily costs are $50.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the daily revenue - We can estimate the revenue by multiplying the total hours booked by the price per hour.\n\nDaily revenue = ($245/hour) \u00d7 (2 hours) = $490/day\n\nStep 3: Calculate the monthly revenue - As there are days in a year, to find the monthly revenue, we just have to multiply the daily revenue by 30.\n\nMonthly revenue = ($490/day) \u00d7 (30 days) = $14,700/month\n\nStep 4: Calculate the yearly revenue - As there are 12 months in a year, we can find the yearly revenue by multiplying the monthly revenue by 12.\n\nYearly revenue = ($14,700/month) \u00d7 (12 months) = $176,400/year\n\nStep 5: Calculate the estimated yearly investment yield - To find the investment yield, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the initial investment and subtract 1.\n\nEstimated investment yield = (($176,400/year) - $98,000) / $98,000\n\nStep 6: Calculate the estimated investment yield - Performing the division and subtraction, we get the estimated investment yield:\n\nEstimated investment yield = $78,400 / $98,000 = 0.80 or approximately 80%.\n\nAnswer: (A) 0.80% (80%)",

When merchandise is purchased on credit, it increases inventory (asset) and also increases accounts payable (liability) for the amount owed to the supplier.\n2. In this case, Arno Co. did not record the credit purchase but included the merchandise in the year-end inventory. This means that the inventory (asset) was correctly represented in the balance sheet.\n3. However, the purchase was not recorded, so the accounts payable (liability) was not increased to reflect the amount owed to the supplier.\n4.

In other words, it is a company that is required to disclose its financial statements and accounting records to the public.\n\nStep 2: The question asks about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer. A nonissuer is a company that has not issued publicly traded shares, so they are not required to disclose their financial statements and accounting records to the public.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's analyze each statement for audit sampling risks.\n\n(A) This statement explains nonsampling risk for sampling, which implies that if the auditor had tested every item in the population, the conclusions might be different. For nonissuers, audit sampling is not a requirement, so this statement doesn't apply.\n\n(B) This statement also refers to nonsampling risk. Again, it doesn't apply to nonissuers as it's not their financial responsibilities.\n\n(C) and (D) are both related to sampling risk. However, both statements discuss aspects related to audit procedures for identifying and addressing specific risks, which is not applicable for nonissuers.\n\nConclusion: None of the statements given about audit sampling risks is correct for a nonissuer.\n\nAnswer: N/A (not applicable)",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Determine Carson's share of the taxable income\nCarson owns 40% of the outstanding stock in the C corporation, which reported $400,000 in taxable income. So, Carson's share of the taxable income is 40% of $400,000:\n\n$400,000 * 0.40 = $160,000\n\nStep 2: Determine the cash dividends Carson received\nThe corporation distributed a total of $70,000 in cash dividends among its shareholders. Since Carson owns 40% of the stock, they would have received 40% of the dividends:\n\n$70,000 * 0.40 = $28,000\n\nStep 3: Determine Carson's taxable income if the corporation had been an S corporation\nIf the corporation had been an S corporation, Carson's total taxable income would be the sum of their share of the taxable income and the amount of their cash dividends. So, add the amounts determined in steps 1 and 2:\n\n$160,000 + $28,000 = $188,000\n\nTherefore, if the corporation had been an S corporation and distributions were proportionate, Carson would have reported $188,000 in income on their individual return.
