This encourages the model to choose smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of increasing the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient on the bias and variance of the model:\n\n1. As we increase the coefficient, the model will be more heavily penalized for having large weights.\n2. This will force the model to choose smaller weights, which can help reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.\n3. Reducing the complexity of the model can lead to a decrease in the variance of the model, as the model will be less sensitive to small changes in the training data.\n4. However, reducing the complexity of the model can also lead to an increase in the bias of the model, as the model may not be able to capture the true relationship between the features and the target variable as accurately.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Bias increase ; Variance decrease",
