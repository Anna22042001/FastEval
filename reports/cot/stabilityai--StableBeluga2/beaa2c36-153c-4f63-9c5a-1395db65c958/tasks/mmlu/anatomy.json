This results in an opening in the roof of the mouth.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate incorrect options\n(A) palatine processes - This option only includes the palatine processes, which are not enough to cause a complete bilateral cleft palate.\n(D) palatine, frontonasal, secondary nasal processes and mandibular processes - This option includes too many processes, as mandibular processes are not responsible for the development of the palate.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct option\n(B) palatine and frontonasal processes - This option includes the palatine and frontonasal processes, which are the primary processes responsible for the development of the palate.\n(C) palatine, frontonasal and secondary nasal processes - This option includes the palatine, frontonasal, and secondary nasal processes, which are also responsible for the development of the palate.\n\nStep 6: Determine the best answer\nBoth options (B) and (C) are correct, but option (B) is more specific and directly answers the question.\n\nAnswer: (B) palatine and frontonasal processes.",
