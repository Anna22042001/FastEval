This creates four equal rectangles, each with an area of 1 unit.\n\nStep 2: Find the area of the region where $x < y$.\n\nIn this case, the region where $x < y$ is the left half of each of the four smaller rectangles. Since each smaller rectangle has an area of 1 unit, the left half of each has an area of 0.5 units. There are four such regions, so the total area of the region where $x < y$ is 4 * 0.5 = 2 units.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability.\n\nThe total area of the rectangle is 3 * 2 = 6 units.

We can do this by finding the number of ways to arrange the digits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (since 1 is a factor of 180 and can be ignored) and then multiplying by 2 (since there are two ways to include the 1, either at the beginning or the end of the product).\n\nThere are 5 digits to arrange, and we can do this in 5! = 120 ways. Multiplying by 2 gives us 2 * 120 = 240 arrangements. However, this double counts some arrangements where the digits are the same (e.g., 223456 and 23456). Since there are 5 digits, there are 5 choose 2 (5C2) = 10 pairs of digits that can be the same.\n\nFor each pair of digits that can be the same, there are 4C2 = 6 ways to choose which two digits are the same and 2 ways to arrange them.
