            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation states that regions with an initial advantage will continue to grow and prosper, while regions with an initial disadvantage will continue to struggle and fall further behind. This process creates a self-reinforcing cycle, where the core (advantaged regions) dominate the periphery (disadvantaged regions).\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement.\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement contradicts the theory of cumulative causation, as it suggests that both developed and developing regions benefit equally from trade. In Myrdal's theory, the core (developed regions) dominate the periphery (developing regions) through trade.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement is consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, as it suggests that the core (advantaged regions) will continue to dominate the periphery (disadvantaged regions).\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement is also consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, as it suggests that the growth and prosperity of the core (advantaged regions) comes at the expense of the periphery (disadvantaged regions).\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement is also consistent with Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, as it suggests that regions with an initial advantage (the core) will continue to grow and prosper by attracting labor, capital, and trade.\n\nStep 3: Identify the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\nThe statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is (A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
