However, this is not a fundamental cause of fatigue, as ADP concentration is not the primary factor affecting fatigue during high intensity exercise.\n\nOption (B) suggests that fatigue is caused by inhibition of ATP production. While this can contribute to fatigue, it is not the fundamental cause, as there are other factors that can lead to fatigue during high intensity exercise.\n\nOption (C) suggests that fatigue is caused by the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. This is the most accurate option, as high intensity exercise requires a significant amount of ATP, and when the supply cannot keep up with the demand, fatigue occurs.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\nThe fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is (C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.",
