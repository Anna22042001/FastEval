Formal validity refers to the structure of the syllogism, while material truth refers to the truth of the premises and conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options\n(A) cannot be materially true: This option suggests that if a syllogism is formally invalid, it cannot be materially true.\n(B) might be materially true: This option suggests that a formally invalid syllogism could still be materially true.\n(C) might be materially untrue: This option suggests that a formally invalid syllogism could still be materially untrue.\n(D) both B and C: This option suggests that a formally invalid syllogism could be either materially true or materially untrue.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the options\nA formally invalid syllogism means that the structure of the reasoning is flawed.

He then presents a hypothetical conversation where someone disagrees with the concept of appropriate technology, to which Schumacher responds by questioning if the person believes in inappropriate technology.\n\nStep 3: Match the quote to the given options.\n(A) Equivocation - The misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense.\n(B) Inconsistency - A lack of harmony between parts or elements of something.\n(C) Appeal to Authority - Using the opinion of an authority figure to support an argument.\n(D) Prejudicial Language - Language that is intended to influence the listener by using words with strong emotional implications.\n\nStep 4: Determine the most appropriate option.\nSchumacher's response in the hypothetical conversation is a play on words, using the term \"inappropriate technology\" to challenge the person's disagreement.
