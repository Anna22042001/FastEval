However, since there are a few highly paid administrators, the mean would be skewed higher, making it less representative of the majority of teachers.\n\n(B) The mode of all the salaries: The mode represents the most frequently occurring salary. However, this statistic may not be very informative in this case, as it could be influenced by the salaries of either teachers or administrators.\n\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries: This statistic measures the spread of salaries. While it could be useful in understanding the distribution of salaries, it doesn't provide a clear picture of what the teachers are currently earning.\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries: The median represents the middle value in the salary distribution. This statistic is less affected by outliers (like highly paid administrators) and provides a better representation of what the majority of teachers are currently earning.\n\nBased on this analysis, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote:\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",
