This process helps to balance any potential confounding factors, such as age, gender, or pre-existing conditions, across the groups.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer\nRandomization of study subjects is most helpful for controlling for (A) Placebo effect. By randomly assigning participants to different groups, it helps to ensure that any placebo effect is evenly distributed across the groups, reducing the potential for bias.\n\nAnswer: (A) Placebo effect",

The study subjects are then divided into smokers and non-smokers, and no association is found within either group.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options\n(A) Observer bias: This occurs when the researcher's expectations or beliefs influence the results of the study.\n(B) Confounding: This occurs when a third variable is related to both the exposure and the outcome, making it difficult to determine the true relationship between the exposure and the outcome.\n(C) Placebo effect: This is a psychological effect where a person's belief in a treatment can lead to an improvement in their condition, even if the treatment is ineffective.\n(D) Nonresponse bias: This occurs when the people who respond to a survey or study differ in important ways from those who do not respond, leading to biased results.\n\nStep 3: Determine the correct answer\nIn this scenario, the initial finding of a strong association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer is not supported when the study subjects are divided into smokers and non-smokers.
