            "question": "If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room then\n\n(A) GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.\n(C) GDP is unaffected because it is a second hand sale.\n(D) GI)P decreases because I decreases.",

            "model_answer": "(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nXYZ Corporation is buying an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room. We need to determine the effect of this purchase on GDP.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant components of GDP\nGDP is made up of four components: Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Spending (G), and Net Exports (X - M).\n\nStep 3: Determine which component is affected by the purchase\nIn this case, the purchase of the painting is an investment by the corporation. Therefore, the relevant component of GDP is Investment (I).\n\nStep 4: Analyze the effect of the purchase on the relevant component\nSince the corporation is buying the painting, it is increasing its investment. This means that the value of Investment (I) is going up.\n\nStep 5: Determine the overall effect on GDP\nSince I is increasing, GDP will also increase.\n\nAnswer: (B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.",
