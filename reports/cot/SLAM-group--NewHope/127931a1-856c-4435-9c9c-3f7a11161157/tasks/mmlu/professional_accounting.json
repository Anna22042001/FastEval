            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Estimating the yearly yield, we need to take into account how many days are there in a typical year (365 days). \n\nStep 2: Since it is mentioned that the limo will be rented for 2 hours a day on average, there will be a total of 2 hours/day x 365 days = 730 hours a year of limo rental.\n\nStep 3: We have to subtract the downtime or maintenance of the limo. Although it's not specified in the question, let's assume one week of downtime which equals 7 days x 24 hours = 168 hours. 730 hours of rental - 168 hours of downtime gives us 562 hours left for rental. \n\nStep 4: We need to subtract the estimate of the daily cost of $50 for the limo, to get our revenue from rental. This comes out to be $562 hours x $245= $130,005. \n\nStep 5: Now this is our gross rental income. However, this income is expended in order to pay the acquisition cost of the limo. \n\nStep 6: Remember, the limo cost $98,000. So we now need to subtract the cost from our gross rental income to determine the net income. This puts us in the calculation of 130,005 - 98,000 = $32,005.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the estimated yield of the investment per annum is around $32,005.\n\nIn terms of percentage, we can calculate it as follows: \n\nStep 8: To find the percentage, we divide our net rental income ($32,005) by the initial cost of the Limousine ($98,000) and multiply by 100%.\n\nStep 9: This gives us an approximation of about 33.5% yield on the investment. \n\nBut, given the rental estimation per day and cost, this percentage yield might not be accurate according to the situation. If the Limousine is fully booked and running for the entire time without any downtime, the yearly percentage yield would be higher. Similarly, if the Limousine requires more frequent maintenance or more unbooked hours, the yield would be lower.\n\nSo, in the question context, it's not clear to provide an accurate yearly yield. It depends more on usage, rental demand, and maintenance. For a real-life business, a comprehensive analysis would be required to gain an accurate picture.",

            "model_answer": "This problem occurs quite frequently in businesses where proper accounting practices are not observed. Since this is a problem that requires accounting knowledge, I will use accounting terminology.\n\nHere, we have to consider the double entry system of accounting where every credit has a corresponding entry on the debit side of another account.\n\nOne important rule in accounting is that expenses are recorded in the period they are incurred. Expenses are debited and assets or liabilities are credited. If the expense is for the purchase of an asset like merchandise, the cost of the asset will be stored as an Asset and the cost would be the debit. The company who paid the expense (it could be cash, credit or a liability) will be credited as they become liable because of the expense. \n\nTherefore, if Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end but the merchandise was included in the ending inventory, it means that the expense was accrued (i.e., recorded) in inventory but not in the financial statements of the current year (which would have required childing the expense). \n\nIn financial accounting, expenses must be recorded in the year they are incurred. Hence, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise will understate the expenses of the current year and overstate the assets (inventory) in that year. These under/overstatements will lead to a skewed picture of profitability and solvency of the firm at the year-end.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D (Understated, Understated). The Omitted expense is understated, which in turn understates the liabilities and due to this the annual report will underreport the expenses and overvalue the inventory. \n\nAnd lastly,\n253 (writing the single correct letter A explained in this way in Latex) is the answer.",

            "model_answer": "The problem wants us to reason about an audit sampling scenario and is requested to answer as per different given statements but does not ask for the computation or any associated calculations. However, solving this problem requires knowledge on audit sampling and an understanding of the given statements.\n\nLet's go through each of the statements:\n\n1. Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\n\nHere, non-sampling risk is associated with the fact that when test samples are limited, the auditor's assertions may deviate from the overall population.\n\n2. Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\n\nThis is true. Nonsampling risk arises when auditors don't identify misstatements, compromising the validity of the audit opinion.\n\n3. Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\n\nThis is also correct. When sampling is used, the inherent uncertainty of selecting a proper sample that represents the entire population introduces the risk of incorrect responses or conclusions.\n\n4. Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\n\nThis is not entirely correct. Sampling risk does not include the likelihood that an auditor has chosen inappropriate audit procedures in light of the intended objective. This would come under planning risk. Rather, it's possible that businesses will not use a proper or random sample approach.\n\nConsidering the above explanation, we can define the given problem as, making sure the audit sample size gives a representative statistic of the whole population.\n\nHowever, to answer the question, we would need to evaluate all options, do a comparative analysis, and deduce which of these are true in context of the situation mentioned in the problem. But since the problem is conceptual, the final answer to the given question wouldn't be answered with a yes/no response or with an arithmetic equation - it requires evaluating an understanding of audit samplings and its risks.\n\nThe \"sample\" here could indicate two different things:\n\n- A subset of a population for evaluative purposes. For instance, into which category a given product falls.\n- And it could refer to the act of sampling.\n\nFor the problem at hand, sampling would most likely be referring to the latter, where statistical inference is applied to a smaller slice of information (sample) to draw conclusions about a larger category (the population). So, considering the four statements provided, 1 and 3 are clearly on point.\n\nStatement 1 talks about the deviation between a population and a sample. In sampling risk, we remember that auditing looks for anomalies or outliers which makes this a plausible answer.\n\nOn the other hand, statement 3 discusses the inherent unpredictability of applying audit procedures to specific cases due to the randomness of sampling. This is to say that sampling could yield false positives or negatives, resulting in risk.\n\nRegarding statement 2, yes, nonsampling risk may result in failing to detect misstatements but they are not necessarily exclusive to a sampling context, and the question does not specifically ask about nonsampling risks - so we'd exclude this one from our answer for now.\n\nStatement 4 has nothing to do with sampling. It may be true generally but doesn't provide information relevant to the given context, where the sampling of audit procedures to achieve specific objectives hasn't been mentioned.\n\nHence, the correct answer would be: Statements 1 (B) and 3 (D).",

Understanding of Auditing and Subsequent Events.\n\n   An auditor generally performs procedures to test the balance sheet's figures to see that they are accurate and fair. This includes testing the figures before and after the balance sheet date.\n\n2. Defining Subsequent Events.\n\n   A subsequent event is a financial event that occurs between the balance sheet date and the date when the financial statements are issued. It is of two types:\n\n   - Identifiable: They meet the definition of an asset, liability, or equity instrument. \n\n   -Unidentifiable: They are not recognized as having to be measured and recorded in the financial statements.\n\n3. Auditor's Responsibility and Subsequent Events.\n\n   The auditor's responsibility includes recognizing and understanding subsequent events, assessing their materiality, and communicating their effect - if any - on the financial statements.\n\n4. Applying the Knowledge.\n\n   Regarding subsequent events, the auditor would generally perform procedures in the form of tests to collect evidence about the subsequent event's effect on the balance sheet items. \n\n5. Transferring Information.\n\n   The answer choices provided here reflect common situations or procedures that an auditor would use to test for the effects of subsequent events.\n\n6. Answer Identification.\n\n   The correct choice is C; this is because checking the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end is the optimal method of testing for subsequent events. Bank accounts can provide the auditor with the most recent and earliest analytical evidence, which can help in getting a grip on the financial health of the business. \n\nThe answer to the multiple choice question is C is: \n\n```\nC\n```\n\nThe auditor generally performs C (Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end). This is because checking the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end would yield the most recent financial information of the client, which is crucial for identifying subsequent events that might impact the financial health of the client.",

Firstly, this is essentially an equivalent of multiple choice questions with a really complicated way of presenting it, which might not be the best approach to learn from.

Since it's referred to as a 'straight line', the premium is adjusted equally over the life of the bond. The journal entries would look like this for a year:\n\nDebit Interest Expense, Credit Premium on Bonds.\n\nEffective interest method: This approach considers the actual rate of interest and the amount of cash that will be received at maturity. It records accrued interest and adjusts the carrying value of the bonds as discrepancies arise, based on the timing of the principal payments. The journal entries would look like this for a year:\n\nDebit Interest Expense, Credit Premium on Bonds. In some cases, there would be nil recording.\n\nHere is how each of the given scenarios would have been affected:\n\nScenario A: \"Overstated.\" In the straight-line amortization, since the amortization of the premium is on a straight line approach, the company will be overstating the premium account and thus the bond carrying value, because the portion of the premium related to those periods has been amortized which have only a few months remaining. However, in the effective interest, this won't happen as the amortization of the premium was nil in the year when only few months remain.\n\nScenario B: \"Understated\". Using the straight-line amortization method would have understated the overall interest expense as the premium was amortized evenly, without considering the actual interest rate. The effective interest method doesn't have this issue.\n\nScenario C: \"Overstated.\" The bond carrying value in the balance sheet is overstated as compared to the market value. This overstatement would continue until the bond matures in the straight-line amortization method. However, using the effective interest method, this error would not have occurred if all cash flows have been considered and the carrying value rightly adjusts to the market value.\n\nScenario D: \"No effect.\" It's because the journal entries cancels out. In straight-line amortization, an error in calculation will attempt to adjust the premium on bonds, but it doesn\u2019t have any effect on the overall earnings (because the same amount of amortization happens every year). The effective interest method makes sure interests are calculated accurately, but it's the carrying value of bond and interest expense which gets affected.\n\nFinally, the answer to the question: The error in amortization methods would have resulted in the following changes in carrying amounts: Scenario A and Scenario B are wrong and wouldn't occur in the effective interest method which should be implemented, but Scenario C is accurate and Scenario D varies depending on the circumstances. It's recommended to use the \"Effective Interest Method\" as it computes the correct amount of interest for each period. Thanks.",

Therefore, $700 - $28,000 = $672 of this income was not distributed in the form of dividends.\n\nStep 6: Calculate how much of the undistributed income is due to the corporation's tax status as a C corporation.\n\nThe major difference between a C corporation and an S corporation is the tax treatment of dividends and distributions. In a C corporation, the corporation pays taxes on profits, and distributions are treated as additional income. In contrast, in an S corporation, profits, losses, and distributions pass through to the owners, and are not subject to corporate taxation.\n\nTherefore, the additional income Carson recognizes of $672 is effectively \"tax income\" of this corporation, which it would not have had in an S corporation, where the distribution of earnings would not be treated as additional income for the shareholders.\n\nStep 7: With an S corporation, the distributions to shareholders are not taxed as income. Therefore, the $672 needs to be removed from the income allocated to Carson. \n\nTherefore, the income that Carson would report on their individual return if the corporation was an S corporation is 4/10 * $400,000 - $280 = $160,000.
