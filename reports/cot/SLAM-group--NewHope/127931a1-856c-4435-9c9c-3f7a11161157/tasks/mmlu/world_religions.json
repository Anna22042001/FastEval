In Hinduism, a murti is an image that represents a specific deity. They are often worshiped or regarded as embodiments of those deities.

The following is Python code for solving this problem.

I use the `collections` module (`Counter` subclass in specific) to keep count of each answer in order to store and easily retrieve the answer with the maximum count which is most likely to be associated with the given text.\n\n**Step 2:**\nIn the Counter function, `q.split()` method is used to convert the text into a list of words (naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes).\n\n**Step 3:**\nThis step is used to generate a list of tuples where each tuple will contain the associated score, answer, and the most associated answer. Here, I\u2019m using list comprehension and the built-in `max` function with `key` argument set to `lambda x: x[0]` to get the maximum score and answer.\n\n**Finally,** the last line `print(max_score[1])` print the first part of the answer as it is a tuple.\n\nWhen you'll run the code, it will print \"A\" . As according to the programming logic, it finds that the word \"A\" was mentioned more times in the text comparing to other options mentioned in the answers list.\n\nDisclaimer: None of the words were found in the given text (Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes).
