            "model_answer": "_(A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime_\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\nThis is a multiple choice question asking which of the four options best describes the attributes (using adjectives or adverbs) of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.\n\nFirst, we need to determine whether it's correct to use '______' and 'are becoming increasingly mainstream' as given prerequisite of the sentence.\n\nThe growing use of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, especially over the last year, confirms that they are becoming increasingly mainstream.\n\nNext, let us move to the attributes discussed in each option. \n\n1. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are expensive - this is true due to the high demand for them.\n\n2. They are secure - owing to their decentralized nature, cryptocurrencies are secured by cryptography.\n\n3. They are associated with financial crime - There have been numerous instances of cryptocurrency being used for illegal activities like money laundering and other forms of financial crime.\n\nNow, whether they are 'cheap' or 'unsecure' can be ruled out based on the facts. They're not cheap due to their high demand, and their decentralized nature does not make them inherently 'unsecure.' They're neither 'charitable giving' nor are they 'traditional currencies.' They don't fit into these categories at all, confirming that these options are incorrect.\n\nSo, the valid options are (A) and (B), and (A) fits best based on the provided information.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer to the given question can be found by following a step-by-step reasoning:\n\nLet's fill in the blanks using the suggestions provided. For now, let's say that the words that need to be placed in parenthesis for each option are:\n1. A: unsafe practices, (cause) want, (cause) fear, trivial\n2. B: unsafe practices, (cause) distress, fear, serious\n3. C: safe practices, want, (cause) jealousy, trivial\n4. D: safe practices, distress, jealousy, serious\n\nThere are only 3 words we need to consider for all these options. Looking at the words suggested for each space above, 'want', 'fear,' and 'trivial' predominantly describe unfavorable outcomes or practices, in contrast. 'Distress,' on the other hand, represents a negative experience, which aligns better with the negative connotations associated with 'unsafe' and 'unfavorable'. Further, 'distress' has synergy with 'serious'. \n\nNow we can refine the options:\n1. A: unsafe practices, (cause) want, (cause) fear, trivial\n2. B: unsafe practices, (cause) distress, fear, serious\n3. C: safe practices, want, (cause) jealousy, (cause) trivial\n4. D: safe practices, distress, jealousy, serious\n\nBy comparing these refined options, it is more logical for circumstance where practices/adverts are 'safe' to prohibit 'want', as wanting something could drive people to potentially engage in unsafe practices in order to attain it. Additionally, outcomes such as causing 'trivial' problems or 'fear' do not align well with 'safe' practices. Hence, 'safe' or 'unsafe' practices should be followed and 'want' and 'fear' experience should also be avoided.\n\nTherefore, the above implies:\n1. A: unsafe practices, (cause) want, (cause) fear, trivial\n2. B: safe practices, (cause) want, (cause) fear, trivial\n3. C: unsafe practices, (cause) want, (cause) fear, trivial\n4. D: safe practices, (cause) want, (cause) fear, trivial \n\nHowever, all these options use the same set of words. There is no clear distinction between 'safe' and 'unsafe' practices and 'want.' The choices evolve to this point symmetrically for safe and unsafe outcomes and want or fear. This ambiguity contradicts the original intention of the question.\n\nIf we return to the options and find one that clearly differentiates these ideas consistently, it would be option D: unsafe practices cause want, fear, jealousy, and serious outcomes. Meanwhile, option A would best describe safe practices, precluding want, fear, and trivial outcomes. Here, D is Plan A and A is Plan B.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\nPlan A: (A) Unsafe practices, cause want, cause fear, trivial\nPlan B: (B) Safe practices, do not want, do not fear, do not trivial",

            "model_answer": "___ are the _____ of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. Answer: Employee obligations. Employee duties should be the correct answer to the prompt.\n\nWhile the problem as stated is simple to solve directly because the correct answer is outlined in the prompt, let's go through step by step problem solving.\n\nStep 1: Understand the Question\nFirst, we need to understand the question properly. It states ____ are the _____ of workers towards their employer, based on individual contracts and wider employment laws. So, the question is asking us to determine the obligations an employee has towards their employer.\n\nStep 2: Input all the Possible Answers\nNext, we'll input all the possible answers given in the multiple-choice format: \n(A) Employee rights, (B) Employee rights, (C) Employer duties, (D) Employee duties.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Correct Answer\nNow, analyze the correct answer based on the requirements given in the question. According to the question, the obligations of workers towards their employer are usually based on both individual contracts and wider employment laws. This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the obligations that the employees have towards their employer.\n\nStep 4: Eliminate the Wrong Answers\nStart by eliminating the wrong answers based on the analysis. (A) Employee rights and (C) Employer duties could be crossed off because they don't directly state the employee's obligation to their employer, only their rights. (B) Employee rights and (D) Employee duties are the correct answers because they relate to the obligations of the employees. But, again, only (D) Employee duties, directly lists the employees' obligations to their employers. So, the correct answer is:\n\n_(D) Employee duties_\n\nStep 5: Outputting the answer\n(D) Employee duties.",

            "model_answer": "We are given a statement:\n\n_______ is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities which, due to intensification of work and technological shifts, has become a hotly contested issue in recent years.\n\nThis is a single sentence where the _________ is bolded in the question. The task is to input one of the following terms:\n\n(A) Presenteeism\n(B) Absenteeism\n(C) Work-play balance\n(D) Work-life balance\n\nas the answer in the blank. \n\nLet's solve this problem step-wise:\n\nStep 1: As the question is a little complex, let's break it down further. It says that the focus is on an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities.\n\nStep 2: Whole sentence narrows down to importance given to \"work-life balance\" (Work-related activities versus non-work related, work-life balance refers to ratio of how actively we engage in both work and life related activities).\n\nStep 3: Out the four options given, (C) Work-play balance and (D) Work-life balance seem close to the general idea of balance between work and life, thus, we first need to choose between them.\n\nStep 4: When the context is about an employee's balance between activities, other factors like Presenteeism and Absenteeism seem more inclined towards employers/management which is a slightly different context from \"employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities\". Absenteeism is the rate at which employees are absent. Presenteeism is the rate at which employees are present but not productive due to illness. Neither of these quite fits the context of this problem, hence we should move ahead and eliminate these two.\n\nStep 5: Based on the context and the reasoning till now, we come to believe that the best fit would be (D) - 'Work-life balance' as it directly addresses the issue of striking the right balance between work life and non work life.\n\nStep 6: So, the answer is:\n\nWork-life balance\n\nAfter applying all the given steps, the result will be:\n\n'Work-life balance' is an employee's preferred ratio between work-related and non-work-related activities which, due to intensification of work and technological shifts, has become a hotly contested issue in recent years.",

The passage given seems to give certain hints about intricate relations within a specific context of which options A, B and D can be considered as the plausible answers. This mentions about industry, companies, resources, supply, ecosystems, wastes and sustainability. However, an exact match seems to be missing. \n\nTo solve this question, the strategy would be the following:\n\n1. Understanding the question: The question is multiple choice, asking for an answer from four or more alternatives. The gist of the statements seems to hint the answer towards in-organic supply loops (A), but looking into a wider context can also include industrial ecosystems (B) and corporate ecosystems (D).\n\n2. Reading the question: The question itself indicates the answer is one letter (A, B, C or D), and the last line only contains these options and no other interpretations or thereby potentially misleading information.\n\n3. Let's now refer to the options: The question gives four options, A, B, C and D.\n\n4. Analysis of the options: \n\n     A. Industrial supply loops: This suggests an interrelation between industries, resources and supplies, which is tightly linked to the hints in the given passage.\n     \n     B. Industrial ecosystems: This could fit well as it mentions industries and wastes talking about the entirety of the intricate interdependencies and relationships.\n     \n     C. Ecological ecosystems: The given passage suggests a coherence with ecosystems and sustainability. However, this might be a misleading choice as the ecological aspect is explained in relation to natural ecosystems, not industrial ones.\n     \n     D. Corporate ecosystems: This fits well with the company-oriented context mentioned in the passage as well as the hint on interdependencies between companies.\n\n5. Answer elicitation: After doing an in-depth analysis of the question and considering intricate relations, 'B' and 'D' can be plausible answers considering the hinted context from the passage. The best answer matches both, corporate networks and the industrial ecosystem, implying 'D' as the answer.\n\nFinally, the best interpretation of the question and answer would be:\n\n_______ can be a likened to their natural counterparts, comprising of balanced network of interdependent organisms and their environments thus encouraging the importance of sustainability thinking due to companies and industries considered as bound together, and interdependent due to all kind's resources and wastes.\n\n(D) Industrial ecosystems.",

In a sense, there may be a risk of being hoodwinked in such situations.\n\nWhen we take option D as answer, We are saying that CSOs being CSOs bring about Informational asymmetries in the business collaborations, where one party is benefited more. In such cases there may be risk of one party getting co-opted.\n\nThis problem can be solved by following the steps as mentioned.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "This problem appears to be related to the domain of ethics and philosophical theories, which can be debated from many highly nuanced angles. As an AI, I will provide a simple answer on a purely theoretical level rather than a broad or comprehensive reflection about ethics across history. \n\nFor sake of specific reply, normative theory corresponds to prescriptive theories of ethics that tell us how we ought to act. The question asks which ethical theory is 'most similar' to the promoted profit maximization in corporations.\n\nA) Hedonistic Utilitaritianism: The theory of hedonistic utilitarianism suggests that right action is determined by the ability if it promotes overall human happiness. However, this hinges on the nature of happiness which seems problematic when used to support greedy corporate behavior. This theory arguably does not align well with corporate profit maximization.\n\nB) Preference Utilitaritianism: In this theory, right action is determined by the extent to which it maximizes the preference satisfaction of sentient beings. This might be a better fit for corporate behavior since it takes into account the preferences of employees and consumers, both sentient beings. It's a step closer to profit maximization.\n\nC) The Categorical Imperative: The Categorical Imperative, a pillar of Immanuel Kant\u2019s ethics, states that to know what your moral duty is, you need merely ask what if everyone did this? The imperative doesn\u2019t consider personal desires and ignores individual well-being. Hence, it does not align with promoting corporate profits as a goal.\n\nD) Ethics of care: This theory promotes the importance of care and nurturing in the formation of a moral social system. It emphasizes empathy, compassion, and a duty of care towards others. It potentially aligns with ensuring good working conditions for workers, contrasting with pure profit maximization.\n\nOut of these, Preference Utilitarianism seem closest to corporate profit maximization, since businesses should strive to satisfy the preferences of their stakeholders for the highest level of satisfaction. In this theory, as with profit maximization, actions are considered right insofar as they increase total preference satisfaction and are wrong insofar as they decrease it.",

In other words, Friedman believed that businesses should be focused on making profits for their shareholders at the expense of other stakeholders. \n\nLet's focus on the response options provided:\n\n(A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. This best describes the perspective of Milton Friedman's view.\n(B) Managers should act in ways that balance the interest of society and shareholders. This isn't in line with Friedman's view because he emphasized primarily serving the interests of shareholders.\n(C) The primary responsibility of organizations is to its employees. This isn't in line with Friedman's view as he believed businesses are essentially for profit and their primary goal should be to serve the shareholders.\n(D) The primary responsibility organizations have is to its stakeholders. This is also not aligned with Friedman's view since he saw stakeholders broader than just shareholders. This primarily includes employees and stakeholders should not be prioritized over shareholders.\n\nThe only correct response based on Friedman's perspective is option (A), which states \"the only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders\".",
