Let's consider each statement as a boolean value (True or False) and programmatically determine the most frequent response. Here is a Python program:\n\n```python\n# Initialize a dictionary with keys as the options and values as False\nresults = {'A': False, 'B': False, 'C': False, 'D': False}\n\n# Assign True to the response that majority votes for\nfor response in ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']:\n    if response == 'A':\n        results['A'] = True\n    elif response == 'B':\n        results['B'] = True\n    elif response == 'C':\n        results['C'] = True\n    elif response == 'D':\n        results['D'] = True\n\n# Find the response with the most votes\nmost_voted_response = max(results, key=results.get)\n\n# Output the answer\nanswer = f\"{most_voted_response[0]}\" # this will output 'A' if it's the majority, 'B' if 'B' is majority and so on.\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nPlease note that this program runs as a loop until we provide real data and majority vote for one answer.

The approach would also involve the forms of wildlife and natural habitats that could be found on the edges of the city but both these are presumes to be part of the city's ecology and not necessarily the 'correct' answer. Similarly, collective protests are a part of urban sociology but not unique to the ecological approach which implies a specific framework of studying urban spaces.

The rest of the sentence is mainly about how the middle class was involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations, which suggests a participation and interest in the society rather than being about their characteristics.\n   \n    - For choice B, it suggests that the middle classes were diverse. While diversity could be a characteristic of the middle classes, it's not specifically addressing the nineteenth century middle class given the information in the question.\n\n    - For choice C, it states that the middle classes were 'white collar' workers, which aligns with the shift from manual work to more office-oriented jobs in the nineteenth century.\n\n    - For choice D, it states that the middle classes had all of the characteristics mentioned in choices A, B, and C.\n\nStep 4: Check if all the characteristics of the middle classes were mentioned in choice D. The text author says \"involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations\", engaged in 'white collar' work and lived in an urban set.

However, the four options given can be described, analyzed and compared in a manner relevant to Marxist feminism.\n\nLet's take it step by step:\n\nI. A lack of equal rights and opportunities for men and women:\n\nThe idea here is that women simply don't have the same rights and opportunities available to men. However, in modern-day society, numerous arenas have seen incredible progress in the fair treatment of individuals regardless of their gender, which doesn't truly align with the Marxist feminist viewpoint.\n\nII. Sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually\n\nDeveloped by a group of feminists in the 1960s, it suggested that \"sex class\" is a distinct kind of class situation, one where those with the power (usually men) control all aspects of the lives (politically, economically, and sexually) of those who do not have power due to the mere fact of their sex. \n\nII. Women's domestic labour being exploited by the capitalist economy\n\nMarxist feminists believe that in capitalist nations, women's domestic work is not considered part of the national productive sector, and thus, this unpaid labour continues to sustain the economic model of the society.\n\nIV. The dual systems of capitalism and male domination\n\nThe idea is that capitalism is not separate from male domination. Rather, they work together to create and maintain an unequal society.\n\nFrom a programming perspective:\n\nI. To program this, we could create a simple boolean function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef equal_rights(assertion: str)->bool:\n  assert assertion in ['yes', 'no'], \"Invalid input\"\n  return assertion=='yes'\n```\nHowever, this function does not take into account the multi-case scenarios where all men have equal rights but women don't.\n\nII. A complex algorithm could monitor actions, comparing how different sexes are treated across different arenas (economic, political, and social). It could be quite extensive though, possibly needing a machine learning model.\n\nIII. This would require keeping a running tally of statistical data on how many men and women engage in unpaid work.\n\nIV. Similar to the complexity of point II but should possibly use a more complex data model to handle the intersections of class and gender.\n\nFrom a theoretical perspective one could argue that these views are hard to capture in programming due to their interpretative nature and complexity which somehow get beyond the logical computations. \n\nDespite these interpretational difficulties, there are myriad aspects of analyzing gender inequality using computational tools like data analytics, machine learning, and even video game simulations. Python, as a language, due to its simplicity and interpretability, is well suited for this.",
