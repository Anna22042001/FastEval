            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The United Nations Security Council has 15 permanent members which include five veto-wielding powers (the United States, the Republic of China, France, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom) and ten non-permanent members without veto power.\n\nReasoning:\nIn policy matters, the Security Council meets in private. The Security Council's level of importance can be deduced from the fact that its chamber is the only one of the UN's six principal organs with a public stenographer, who records everything that is said during the proceedings. \n\nAs we know, the UN Security Council have 15 members, 5 of which possess the power of veto. Therefore, each member must sign off on the resolution for it to pass. Normally, this means consensus but if one of these five permanent members vetoes the resolution, the resolution cannot pass.\n\nWith this information, we can compare our options and pick the answer accordingly. \n\nHence, the answer is: \n\n(A) 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power\n\nIt's important to note that each member of the Security Council has one vote, and it takes nine member votes to carry a resolution, including a veto by any of the permanent members. Thus, a veto-wielding power (permanent members) is authorized to veto any resolution. On the other hand, no veto power means they don't have the power to veto.",

            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was a joint resolution of the U.S. Congress during the Vietnam War. This resolution was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on August 7, 1964.\n\nStep 1: Explanation of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution\n\nOn August 2, 1964, a series of violent naval skirmishes took place in the Gulf of Tonkin Sea. The conflict lasted about an hour and caused grave damage. Two more incidents followed on August 4 and 5. The US accused North Vietnam of leading these attacks, on the allegations that US destroyers were attacked by three North Vietnamese torpedo boats.\n\nStep 2: Explanation of the Significance of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin resolution granted the US president the right to get more involved in the war. The resolution was intended to provide Congress' permission for the use of military force in Southeast Asia. The US soon escalated the bombing of North Vietnamese areas.\n\nStep 3: Answering the Question\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B: It illustrated the influence of public opinion on US foreign policy. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution gave President Johnson the power to intensify the U.S. involvement in the war. But the true motive behind the resolution was more to boost popular support for getting involved in the war. The American public strongly supported the measure. Hence, this resolution was more about public relations and illustration of influence of public opinion than about actual decisions of policymaking. The resolution didn't proceed through the usual legislative route but instead went through a joint resolution as it supported the then administration's foreign policy, making the norms a bit gray.",

The other three options - Terrorists, Organized crime, and Drug traffickers - are indeed nonstate actors that pose a threat to the United States.\n\nFollowing is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Each choice provided is an option that does not meet the requirement of a nonstate actor (i.e., a group that operates from a place not considered to be a state by the international law).\n\n2. Terrorists usually do not have a defined geographical area and are not recognized by the international community. \n\n3. Organized crime is related to a network of groups and individuals who, through illicit activities, either conceal their activities or present themselves as legitimate. The majority of organized crime operates from a single geographical area or state.\n\n4. Drug traffickers are other example of nonstate actors. They deal with illegal drugs and most of them operate from a single state or a specific geographical area. Neither are recognized by the international law or observing geo-political conventions.\n\n5. China, considered as an existing country, is a state actor and its threats to U.S. would be markedly different from those of nonstate actors. \n\nFollowing these steps in reasoning China was identified as the only non-response in the question, i.e., D). \n\nHere, the answer: D",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "American exceptionalism is the idea that the United States is inherently different from other countries. It is typically a mix of what is sometimes called nationalism, civic republicanism, and populism. It refers to the distinct forms of government, the specific cultural values, and the generalized political culture differences between the U.S. and other nations. \n\nThe Cold War, on the other hand, was the period from the 1940s through the 1980s, when the world\u2019s most powerful nations, the United States and the Soviet Union, were opposed to one another on many issues.\n\nThe Cold War had a significant impact on American exceptionalism in several ways:\n\n1. The Korean War and Vietnam War: Involvement in these conflicts raised doubts about the strength of American ideals and led to anti-war movements in the United States, challenging the idea of American exceptionalism. \n\n2. Consciousness of a 'chosen responsibility': During the Cold War, the US increasingly casts itself as a defender of freedom and democracy against Soviet communism, a role he felt was required of Washington in light of its power and prosperity. \n\n3. The Civil Rights Movement: Domestic civil rights movements challenged the idea that the United States was an ideal, equal society. The Cold War forced the US to identify itself in an us-vs-them context creating major complexity for American Exceptionalism.\n\n4. The phenomenal economic growth and scientific development observed also fed into the self-nomination ideas due to the attention given to US technological advancements during the Cold War.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that:\n\n(A) Ending the influence of American exceptionalism entirely is not correct since the cold war did enhance American superiority in technology which fostered a sense of exceptionalism.\n\n(B) Exceptionalism was enhanced by America's status as the 'leader of the free world'. It did increase the U.S's influence globally and in some cases intervene in other countries affairs (e.g., Mid-East oil crisis, Korean War, etc.) by virtue of its position as a superpower.\n\n(C) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism. Despite being seen as the defender of freedom and an ideal democratic society, there were also cases where the US was involved in more imperialistic actions, which challenged the core belief that the US is a virtuous and admirable society.\n\n(D) Both b and c.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The events that led to Franklin D. Roosevelt's initial isolationist stance on the part of the US during the 1930s can be clearly understood through historical analysis. An outbreak of a severe economic depression hit the United States in 1929, triggering a series of events fundamental to shaping the US foreign policy at that time.\n\n1. **Personal Experience** Roosevelt had a personal connection with World War I, serving at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference and participating in Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22. Having been at the core of global politics in the immediate postwar years, he surely developed skepticism about America's unrestrained involvement in international affairs.\n\n2. **Popular Expectations** With Europe and the rest of the world going through turbulence in the 1920s, the American public favored isolationism. They wanted the US leadership to keep Americans safe from interference in European politics and wars after the harsh experience of World War I.\n\n3. **Internal Pressures** By the end of the 1920s, foreign policy of the US became more isolationist as Roosevelt focused on internal reforms and minimizing the risk of external conflicts. Additionally, a domestic defense focus gave room for military build up decisions that allowed for a stronger American army by the 1940s although this cannot be reason alone for the USA not intervening during the Spanish Civil war.\n\n4. **Public Law 501** Around 1930, Roosevelt signed Public Law 501, becoming a key piece of isolationist legislation. This law forbade exempt American citizens from serving in the armed forces for any other country. Similar laws were enacted by Hoover, prior to Roosevelt's term in office, forming a cumulative force of American disengagement in European affairs, especially during the Spanish Civil war.\n\nHowever, we should consider that the relaxation of isolationism and entry into World War II was largely prompted by the internment of American soldiers in Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. This specific action, rather than the general domestic and international circumstances, is largely seen as the primary driver of the US entry into World War II.\n\nHere is the answer to the question:\n\n(D) All of the above \n\nThese factors can be said to have contributed to Roosevelt's initial isolationist stance. However, in the end, all of these factors did not hold him from engaging the US in WW II.\n\nThis completes the step-by-step reasoning.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The 'New Populism' refers to a political philosophy or social movement that combines laissez-faire capitalism (minimal government intervention), isolationism, and occasionally a strong anti-elitist sentiment. It is generally skeptical about the benefits and the effects of international cooperation and is oppositional to the establishment and mainstream political parties.\n\nThe term 'New Populism' got initially associated with the rise of Ross Perot in American politics. Perot's movement was anti-establishment, anti-deficit, supportive of free trade, and strongly opposed to the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA), earning his platform the label 'New Populism'.\n\nLooking at the possible answers given, A, B, and C do not accurately describe 'New Populism', but D, 'Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making' shows a trace of 'New Populism'. However, it's not the whole picture. Rather it is only one facet of 'New Populism' which involves an openness to incorporate public opinion in decision-making (or a strain of direct democracy), and a rejection of the internationalism that's prevalent in mainstream political parties. Still a part does not explain the whole because 'New Populism' is a complex ideology influenced by across different aspects, including nationalism, economic freedom, anti-establishment, and populism.\n\nThe \"New Populism\" refers to a strand of political sentiment which is anti-establishment, anti-globalisation, and more focused on domestic issues rather than international collaboration. It reflects a sense of disillusionment with the existing political elite in favor of more directly democratic forms of government. \n\nThis can be illustrated in the platforms of various \"populist\" personalities or parties around the world and through votes for such candidates. The broad range of issues associated with these candidates shows that it is too simplistic to summarize \"New Populism\" under just one letter answer like A, B, C, or D because it's a diverse ideology with many aspects and shades. Following would be a approximately accurate depiction based on reality and current politics:\n\n(A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment \n(B) A strand of internationalist sentiment\n(C) An expression of American cultural superiority\n(D) Increased incorporation of public opinion in foreign policy making\n(E) A general desire to halt and reverse globalization\n(F) An emphasis on direct democracy and a suspicion of representative democracy \n(G) A push for economic nationalism and protectionism. \n\nThus the 'New Populism' can be broadly defined as a form of populist nationalism that combines isolationism with increased economic nationalism. It opposes immigration, supports protectionism, and favors an America First view on foreign policy. It's an anti-establishment ideology.",
