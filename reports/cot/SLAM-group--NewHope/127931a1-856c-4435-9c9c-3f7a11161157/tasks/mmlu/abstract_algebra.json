If G is the main group, H is the subgroup and ker f is the kernel group of f:H\u2192G, then the factor group is G/ker f.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Statement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian\nThis statement is true. A factor group H/K of a non-Abelian group H is itself non-Abelian, because it inherits the non-Abeliano property from H.\n\nStep 3: Analyze Statement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\nThis statement is true. If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K inherits the property of normal subgroup from H and H from G. So, K, as a common intersection, is a normal subgroup of G as well.\n\nBased on the analyses above, we can now answer the question:\nA factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, and if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.

The first statement asserts that if a group or some other mathematical object has an element of a certain order (in various ways, an element may be an order larger than itself), it must have at least 8 elements of the same order. The second statement contradicts this one by asserting that if a group has more than 8 elements of a certain order, it must have at least 16 elements of the same order.\n\nThese two statements cannot both be correct as they contradict each other.\n\nNote that these statements are making assumptions about the ordering of a group, which involves an order and number of elements.

The second statement makes a similar assertion but it raises the lower bound for the number of elements of the specific order from 8 to 16.\n\nIn sum, the problem with these statements is that they seem to be basing the number of required elements of a certain order not only on the existence of the order but also on the number of elements having the order.
