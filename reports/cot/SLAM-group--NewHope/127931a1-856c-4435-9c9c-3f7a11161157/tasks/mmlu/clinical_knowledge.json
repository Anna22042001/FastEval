            "model_answer": "(B) 20 gauge would be appropriate size of cannula to use in a patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion as of 2020 medical knowledge.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\nIn a clinical setting, cannulas are generally used to gain quick, easy access to a patient's bloodstream in an emergency situation. The needle gauge of the cannula refers to the diameter of the bore, therefore, the larger the gauge number, the smaller the diameter of the cannula.\n\nThe most common size cannulas used for rapid blood transfusions are either 20 or 22 gauge. Depending on the age and health of the patient, the vascular access team might be led to recommend a 22 gauge cannula, although it depends on the specific case.\n\nHowever, as of 2020, the preference is more often 20 gauge due to it being generally more flexible and less likely to cause trauma to the surrounding tissue when inserted. This results in a faster healing process and a lower risk of thrombosis. So, the most appropriate answer in this scenario would be (B) 20 gauge. \n\nThis advice should be followed by a consultation with a medical professional who can accurately assess the individual needs, risks, and vulnerabilities of each patient to give considerations for such a rapid blood transfusion.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this type of problem, we are going to apply a very simple algorithm using Python as a programming language. \n\n1st step: Defining the problem - The problem at hand is that we have a list of four options that we need to compare with the attribute of successful running in a marathon. Each option, represented as a concept in our list, will be a string. \n\n2nd step: Input - The input for this problem can be seen as a single value; the attribute that correlates with successful marathon running (B). \n\n3rd step: Process - Here is where we decide 'what should the program do?'. In this case, the program is supposed to match the input attribute with the list options and output the matched one.\n\n4th step: Output - After matching, the program should print the matched option.\n\nLet's write a short piece of code in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_option(option_list, input_option):\n    for each_option in option_list:\n        if each_option == input_option:\n            return each_option\n    return None\n\nprint(find_option([\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"], \"B\"))\n```\n\nThe above Python snippet defines a function \"find_option()\" which takes a list of options and an input option. The function loops over each option in the list and compares with the input. If it gets a match, returns the matching option. If no match is found, it returns \"None\". \n\nSo, when we run the script with the provided list of options and the input attribute (B), the function prints \"B\" which is the correct answer.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "This problem requires a basic understanding of human physiology in relation to exercise and energy metabolism. The context of the problem is specifically focused on sprints or high intensity exercise where the body uses both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism.\n\nHere's a step-by-step reasoning:\n\nThe body uses energy through two main pathways: aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. \n\n**Aerobic metabolism** uses oxygen to extract energy from food and is sustainable. However, it does not produce immediate energy and takes time to start, meaning, you will not get an instant power.\n\n**Anaerobic metabolism** does not require oxygen and produces immediate energy but it is not sustainable.\n\n\nIn relation to sprints or high-intensity exercises, we see a dominance of anaerobic metabolism because in such exercises, power and speed is required instantly and sustaining that power is extremely difficult with aerobic metabolism. The by-product of anaerobic metabolism is lactic acid which causes fatigue.\n\nNow, as the number of sprints increase we see an increase in **anaerobic contribution**.\n\nAs for the incorrect statements (B), (C) and (D),\n\nB) The pH in muscle is often outside the range due to fluctuations in biological processes. There is no clear threshold value for pH related to exercise intensity.\n\nThe concentration of glucose in blood decrease with exercise. However, the cut-off value of 3 mmol/L is probably not generally associated with intensity of exercise. \n\nD) The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism tends to increase when the exercise intensity is lower. With higher intensity exercises like sprints, the aerobic contribution stays relatively constant but the anaerobic contribution significantly increases. So as the number of sprints increases, relative contribution of aerobic metabolism does not necessarily increase.\n\nThe correct answer is then **A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases**.

            "model_answer": "Here are step-by-step explanations for each option:\n\n**(A) Diplopia does not occur if one eye is covered**: Diplopia is a condition where an individual views two images of a single object. This does not resolve with one eye covered because this simply means that each eye is seeing the same thing (one image). If one eye is able to cover the image, then both eyes are pointing to the same image which is not diplopia.\n\n**(B) The outer image is not always the false image**: In diplopia, the outer image is the correct one that your brain is supposed to interpret, while the inner one is the false image. But this is not always the case. If the pupils are misaligned (strabismus), the outer image may not be the false one.\n\n**(C) A fourth nerve palsy can occur when the patient looks upwards**: The fourth cranial nerve (cranial nerve IV, sometimes named simply CN IV) is a nerve that originates in the brain stem. It controls several functions including eye movement. A fourth nerve palsy is a problem with this nerve. Looking up can engage this nerve and potentially lead to vertigo, tinnitus, and diplopia, among other symptoms.\n\n**(D) A sixth nerve palsy does not necessarily cause a divergent squint**: The sixth cranial nerve (abbreviated CNVI) controls lunging (eye movements). Diplopia caused by a sixth nerve palsy does not always result in a divergent squint.\n\nTherefore the correct option is (A).

            "model_answer": "The effect of Sodium bicarbonate supplementation on middle distance running performance is still subject of debate and the correct answer is not clearly known. However, the most premise and widely accepted by the scientific community is (A). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) primarily acts as a pH regulator in the body. Its common use is as an antacid in the treatment of stomach acidity because it has a strong effect in reducing stomach acid (lower its pH through disassociation.)\n\nStep 2: During strenuous exercise, muscle contraction produces lactate. There is a pH drop of the muscles due to the accumulation of H+ during intense exercise. This causes local hypothermia making the muscle fibers less activable (this is one of the reasons for fatigue.) It would be beneficial to buffer the acid produced during exercise and restore the pH to normal, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle cells. This is why (A) is believed to be the answer.\n\nStep 3: In actual fact, all answers are given in the question. Just by looking at the correct answers (A) and (B), we notice a contradiction. A person would expect naHCO3 to decrease the acidity of the muscles because of its functions to neutralize excess hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Additionally, option (C) if correct, it means NaHCO3 elevates the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle which contradicts the main mechanism of how NaHCO3 works which is to increase the pH. This would lead one to believe that the correct answer is not among these three options.\n\nStep 4: Answer (D) is also believed to be incorrect because Sodium bicarbonate supplementation before exercise doesn't elevate the pre-exercise muscle pH as is claimed in the question. Muscle pH is mainly determined by buffering systems in the muscles rather than outside the muscles. Therefore, NaHCO3 supplementation, even though it may affect the blood pH, does not substantially change muscle pH before exercise. \n\nStep 5: All in all, even though it is still a margin of error, the most-accepted answer to this question is (A) as long as the activity in focus is only middle distance running. But these effects could be different in other sports or events.\n\nStep 6: Answer: (A) or (B), but more so (A).\n\nStep 7: Answer without parenthesis and any else: B.",
