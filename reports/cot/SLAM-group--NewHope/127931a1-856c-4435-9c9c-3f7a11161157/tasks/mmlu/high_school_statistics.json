Understanding the distribution of waiting times:\nWe know that the waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed. Such distribution contains all data points and takes on a bell shape where most data (approx. 95-99%) fall around the mean and slowly taper into the tails.\n\n2. Probability and Normal CDF:\nWe'd use the concept of cumulative distribution function (CDF) for probability. The CDF, which has a value for all real numbers depending on the distribution of x, gives the probability that the time for a ride is no greater than x. This probability increases as the mean approaches x.\n\n3. Understanding the distribution with a large number of riders:\nSince the rides could be different, we'll just consider mean and standard deviation for simplicity.\n\n4. Inverse CDF of normal distribution:\nWe know the probability that the ride time is less than x (the CDF), but we may be asked to know the time a specific percentage of riders are likely to have taken.\n\n5. The given problem:\nThe mean waiting time for the ride is 35 minutes and the standard deviation is 10 minutes. With 150,000 riders the first summer, this indicates the ride times are normally distributed with the given mean and standard deviation. The problem asks to find the slowest 100,000 rides' interval.\n\nWith a given lower limit L, the upper limit and hence the answer would depend on the number of rides that fall in the interval (L, U) where U is the mean + (1.5*standard deviation).\n\nPart B of your question is the correct answer as it is used to find the slowest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\n\nThe precise steps to do this would not be programmable and would involve setting up a numerical equation using a function that uses the lower limit and the mean plus or minus 1.5*standard deviation. \n\nLet me note that there could be error,\nsince sometimes in large distributed calculations, you may get answers such as 31.7 (which denotes 31.7 minutes to 35 minutes) because the normal distribution curve is essentially curved and not abrupt at the ends.\n\nOutput:\n(B) 31.7 minutes to 35 minutes",

In your case, it is a 95% confidence interval.\n\nWhen considering interpretation, here are some general principles:\n\n- A confidence interval that includes 0 or 1 does not help inform whether the population median is 0 or 1, respectively.\n- The smaller the width of a confidence interval, the more confident we are that our estimate of the population parameter is accurate.\n\nLooking at your interval as an example, (35095, 45005), the interval includes all numbers up to 45005, implying that all students could fall within this range and a 95 percent probability that the estimated average income per family is within this interval.

            "model_answer": "Experimenting with significance level is a common practice in research to understand whether null hypothesis is false or not. In statistics, there are two types of errors generated at the end of experiment. Type I error, also known as false positive error happens when null hypothesis is true but the researchers fail to find enough evidence to validate that statement. On the flip side, Type II error, otherwise known as false negative error takes place when null hypothesis is incorrect but is incorrectly accepted due to lack of sufficient evidence to counter it.\n\nTo tackle this problem, we consider these two kinds of errors: Type I (\u03b1 error) and Type II (\u03b2 error).\n\nIn the setup of their experiment, researchers make certain decisions like the level of significance, test statistic, sample size, etc. When these parameters are changed, the power of the test can be affected. The Type I and Type II errors work together with power to determine how effective the experiment runs. \n\nThe power is a function of sample size (n) such that the bigger n, the higher the power. However, it's not the ONLY factor affecting power. Other important factors include the variability of the data (\u03b1 level, \u03b2 level, etc.).\n\nConsidering the scenario where the researcher is modifying the experiment to use twice as many experimental units, Here's the breakdown why:\n\n(A) Here Type I error and Type II error are the probabilities of committing error on hypothesis testing. more the sample units, less is the probability of both the errors.\n\n(B) For a fixed significance level, what can change with sample size is the power of the test or how many times we can expect correct detection of an effect. Assuming effect size is the same, power increases when sample size is increased. [Note that higher sample size doesn't always result in higher power though. For a constant effect size, it\u2019s optional whether power goes up or down with sample size]\n\n(C) Similar to above, with increase in sample size, there's more chance to find difference, that is, increase in power. So, Type II error and power would both increase.\n\n(D) This is false. Type I error is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. This error is not dependent on sample size. It will not change even if sample size is increased. However, the power (probabality of NOT committing type II error), could be affected with increase in sample size up to certain point.\n\nSo, the answer is (C). The probability of a type II error and power would both increase. Adding to this, if the test with double number of samples correctly detects the change, that means power of the test has also increased. \n\nThe output of the single letter with a pair of parentheses would be 'C'.",

It tells you how much, on average, values in the distribution differ from the mean value. In statistics, it is used to determine the dispersion of a data set from its mean value, usually expressed in standard deviation units. If the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean is small, it means the observation is close to the mean of the data set, while if the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean is large, it means the observation is far from the mean of the data set.\n\nFor our problem at hand, the distribution will be those of men and women's heights, and the mean values (the population) would be calculated from the mean height for men and women.\n\nIf a person's measurement is (height \u2013 mean_height)/standard_deviation, we can assume that the distribution follows an approximately normal distribution.
