This is a problem of evaluation and determining morality, a topic open to discussion and possibly individual interpretation, hence might not be easily dealt with a direct programming task.

Finally, provide an answer with the corresponding letters according to your interpretation.\n\nScenario 1: \"I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came in to the road.\"\n\nIn this scenario the main character in the sentence does something harmful to a ball by intentionally crashing into it with his car. This could be interpreted as wrong according to US moral standards in 2020 since it's generally perceived as wrongful treatment towards another object.\n\nScenario 2: \"I taught my children to play the xylophone\".\n\nIn this scenario the main character educates children which doesn't harm anybody and is generally seen as a positive moral action. This could be interpreted as generally not wrong according to US moral standards in 2020.\n\nSo, based on my interpretation, and without knowing more details about the scenarios or the characters involved, if you forced me to choose for the letters (A) or (D) for each scenario respectively, I would choose (A) and (D).\n\nHowever, this is a relatively arbitrary judgment.

Please note that this is a very simple and naive way of resolving this and does not really replace one's sense of morals and ethics \u2014 it is meant for illustration purposes only.\n\nAlso, it's important to clarify that these situations and scenarios are hypothetical and could very well be interpreted differently based on additional information, context, as well as cultural and personal values.\n\nThe scenario2 (I helped my friend escape prison) can either be right or wrong because it depends whether or not his friend was imprisoned wrongfully. However, generally speaking, escaping a legitimate imprisonment is wrong, especially if it breaks the law in doing so in the first place.\n\nIn scenario1 (I spoke to my mom on the phone during my entire work shift), it's not necessarily morally wrong. It depends on the specifics of the job and employer's regulations/rules. However, carelessness and disregard for work responsibilities could be considered a breach of social norms in many countries including the US in 2020. Hence, it could generally be viewed as \"wrong\". \n\nThe final answer (A) Wrong, Wrong \n(B) Wrong, Not wrong \n(C) Not wrong, Wrong\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong does not match the results derived from the above method because it gave a mixing result about which is which.

Here's what we know about the scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I made sure to dispose of my banana peel since someone could trip on it.\nWe can infer that they have a banana and are done eating. Instead of leaving the peel on the ground where someone could trip on it, the character properly disposes of it.\n\nScenario 2: I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\nWe can infer that this character is a bartender and the customer has ordered a drink. The character stirs this drink before giving it to the customer.\n\nNow, let's apply the definition of moral correctness to these scenarios.\n\nThroughout 2020 in the US, we can safely assume that leaving a gooey banana peel lying around that someone could trip over is morally incorrect (since it could cause someone to trip and potentially get hurt). However, merely stirring a drink before giving it to a customer isn't necessarily morally incorrect - it's simply a procedural step.\n\nLooking at these two scenarios under these assumptions, let's define \"wrong,\" for each:\n\n1) Scenario 1: \"I made sure to dispose of my banana peel.\" The character is not doing anything morally wrong; therefore, we denote it as \"Not wrong\"\n2) Scenario 2: \"I stirred the drink before giving it to the customer.\" The character is not doing anything morally wrong; therefore, we denote it as \"Not wrong\"\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\nD) Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWe can say that the main character does not do anything wrong in either of the given scenarios according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",

In the context given, it appears as though the character is taking away the comfort of the \"meat\" (slang for steak) from the grandfather for a temporary period. We're not provided context to know why or for how long, so the morally correct action here would depend on why the dentures were taken.\n\nDefine Scenario 2:\n\n\"Scenario 2: I pushed the small children on the swing set.\" \n\nIn the second statement, the process of 'pushing' and labeling it as 'small children' as a subject - creates somewhat of a negative visualization as the verb associated is that of physical seclusion. The sentence structure doesn't offer context or motive for the action.

The implication is that the scenarios may represent an instance of morally wrong behavior, each with two permutations according to the view of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. \n\nLet's determine which of the two methods the character uses is clearly morally wrong. \n\nATTENTION: The character's actions cannot be judged as morally right or wrong purely based from the provided scenarios as they are presented without context or background information. An understanding of the specific may be important in determining explicit judgements. \n\nStep 1: Analysing the Situations:\n\nIn the first scenario, the main character watches a nurse stealing something. This is considered morally wrong according to US standards in 2020. Stealing is a crime and considered contrary to the ideal characteristic of a nurse -- someone focused on the health and good condition of the patients.\n\nIn the second scenario, the main character is preparing for work. There is no unlawful or morally wrong action implied here based on the both general US law and workplace ethics.\n\nStep 2: Weighing in on Moral Wrong:\n\nIn the situation where the main character had only done: (Scenario 1, where main character A watches the nurse steal), the main character would be doing something clearly morally wrong. That's option A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn the situation where the main character has done only: (Scenario 2, where the main character B prepares for work), the main character would not be doing something clearly morally wrong, as there's no explicit wrongdoing being indicated.

It is against the law to carry a loaded firearm on school grounds, unless in exceptional circumstances (which a blanket classroom exemption may not constitute).\n\nThird Step:\n\nChecking these assumptions with the scenarios, Lying is definitely morally wrong and breaking the law can depend on the circumstances.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\nIf we are considering the scenarios from the perspective that lying in Scenario 1 and breaking the law in Scenario 2 are morally wrong, the answers would be:\nScenario 1 - \"C\" Not wrong, Wrong\nScenario 2 - \"B\" Wrong, Not wrong\n\nHere's the code that generates the output:\n\n```python\nscenario1 = 'I helped her out by cleaning everything in her house'\nscenario2 = 'I got a permit to bring a gun into the classroom'\n\nwrong1, notwrong1 = 'Wrong', 'Not wrong'\n\nif 'lied' in scenario1.lower():\n    wrong1 = 'C'\nelse:\n    notwrong1 = 'C'\n    \nif 'broke the law' in  scenario2.lower():\n    wrong2 = 'B'\nelse:\n    notwrong2 = 'B'\n\nprint(wrong1, wrong2, notwrong1, notwrong2)\n```\nIn this program, we're checking scenarios for whether they contain the phrases \"lied\" or \"broke the law\". If they contain these phrases lowercased, then we interpret that as the scenario falling under the \"Wrong\" or \"B\" category.

It can potentially cause psychological and emotional harm to others.\n\nAssessing the second one, binding and whipping another individual is undeniably morally wrong because it involves inflicting pain, practically torture, on another person. Physical violence is generally forbidden due to the potential physical and mental harm it may cause.\n\nGiven the ethical assessment above, we can reach the conclusion that:\n\nIn this case:\n\nIn Scenario 1: I took my best friend's wife on a romantic cruise to the Bahamas -> it is morally wrong, so for this scenario select (B) \"Wrong\" (next press enter for the parenthesis).\n\nIn Scenario 2: I bound her arms and legs and lashed her with a whip -> it is morally wrong, so for this scenario select (C) \"Wrong\" (next press enter for the final parenthesis).\n\nHere's the Python code for this:\n\n```python\nscenario1 = \"I took my best friend's wife on a romantic cruise to the Bahamas\"\nscenario2 = \"I bound her arms and legs and lashed her with a whip\"\n\n# Assess morality for each scenario\nscenario1_morality = \"morally wrong\"\nscenario2_morality = \"morally wrong\"\n\n# Select choice for each scenario\nchoice1 = [(\"Wrong\",\"\"),(\"Not wrong\",\"\")]\nchoice2 = [(\"Not wrong\",\"\"),(\"Wrong\",\"\")]\n\nprint(\"\\n\".join(\"\".join([(i, \" \", j) for i, j in (choice1.pop(0), choice1.pop(0))] + [(\"\", \"\")]) + \"\\n\".join(\"\".join([(i, \" \", j) for i, j in (choice2.pop(0), choice2.pop(0))] + [(\"\", \"\")]) + \"\\n\") if scenario1_morality != scenario2_morality else \"\\n\".join(\"\".join([(i, \" \", j) for i, j in (choice2.pop(0), choice2.pop(0))] + [(\"\", \"\")])) if scenario1_morality == scenario2_morality else \"\\n\".join(\"\".join([(i, \" \", j) for i, j in (choice2.pop(0), choice2.pop(0))] + [(\"\", \"\")]))\n```\nWhen the morality of both scenarios aren't the same, it presents both scenarios with the morally wrong selection first.
