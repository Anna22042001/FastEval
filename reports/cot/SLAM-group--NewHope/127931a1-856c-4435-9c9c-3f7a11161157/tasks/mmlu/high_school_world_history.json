By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

When analyzing the question, the key points to look at are the differences in the approach to warfare and gunpowder weaponry between Western Europe and China during a specific period and what resulted from those differences in terms of long-term military advantage and the dikes of cultural diffusion.\n\nA direct comparison cannot be drawn here, but we know that in the 14th century, Chinese gunpowder technology was more advanced than that of Europe. Still, they didn\u2019t find the artillery as useful as their Western counterparts: the benefits of early artillery in the form of the ability to more quickly breach fortifications in the context of the mostly siege-based European warfare outweighed its drawbacks. Instead, they placed a priority on sharpening their horses archer skills, suitable for their mobile steppe enemies.\n\nDecades later, European development of efficient artillery was to prove decisive in their successful resistance against numerous external threats from the 16th century onwards. It would also enable them to dominate the global landscape in the following centuries, in stark contrast to China's relative decline.

The mention 'domed pavilion' tells about the possible influence of Asia. The Persians are credited with first inventing the dome, which was imitated by the Chinese. So it suggests that Ghanian structures could have been influenced by Asia, however, does not infer direct trade links.\n\n3. Gold is one of the most common commodities traded internationally. So, Ghanian king having gold and jewels doesn't necessarily confirm or deny a trade link with Asia. Ghan is infamous for its gold deposits.\n\n4. The presence of horses in the Ghanian court is an indirect evidence of trade with Asia.

First, we need to identify the basic message communicated in the first passage. This introduces the status of women within the context of this revolutionary period -- a period that brings some semblance of freedom, but not the equality or respect it should also have brought. They are allowed to live without fear, but the benefits of the revolution stop there. It's very clear that during the Revolution, the rights of women are not recognized or considered.\n\n2.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to read the text carefully, identify the key points, and draw appropriate inferences. This question requires a clear understanding of the two given passages to determine the attitude toward the Cawnpore massacre expressed in the second passage.\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation and solution:\n\n1. First, the two paragraphs refer to the same historical event\u2014 the Cawnpore Massacre during the Indian Mutiny in 1857.\n\n2. In the first passage, we see that the massacre was described as 'the peculiar aggravation of the Cawnpore massacres' due to its surprising nature\u2014 Native Indians attacking the British.\n\n3. In the second passage, the context reveals that this was not just a unprovoked act of violence but a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India. This is explicitly expressed in the following sentence \"The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly.\" The massacre was thus seen as a natural outcome of the repressive colonial rule in India. Native people gathered the courage for such an act because they'd had enough of the unequal system.\n\n4. Based on the comparison between these two paragraphs, we can infer that the second passage supports the massacre, at least in the context of rebellion against unjust colonial rule. The massacre was a way of \"matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized\" and challenging the British \"monopoly of violence.\"\n\nSo, we can infer that William Howard Russell in the first passage and Rudrangshu Mukherjee in the second passage have different views on the Cawnpore Massacre. Without actually stating it, the author of the second passage seems to appreciate the courage of the rebels and their motivations more than a random, unprovoked violence. He frames it as a desperate reaction to the imperialists' limiting them from expressing \"their humanness\" or freedom.\n\nNow, to answer the multiple choice question:\n5. The second passage would seem to indicate that the author's position is closest to answer (B)\u2014 the Cawnpore Massacre should be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.",
