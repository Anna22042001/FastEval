Since we already know that Susan was already at the library from 2pm to 6pm, we can eliminate this time interval as an option.\n\nWe also know that Linda saw Susan driving to the water park between 7am and 11am, but we cannot use this time since it is outside of the coffee shop hours.\n\nBased on the coffee shop being closed after 9pm, we can eliminate the time intervals of 11am to 12pm, 1pm to 2pm, 2pm to 6pm, and 12pm to 1pm since Susan was not seen at the library.\n\nTherefore, only the time interval of 7am to 11am remains, and the answer is (A) 6pm to 9pm.",

Therefore, the time she went to the basketball court must be before this time.\nStep 2: We don't have any information about when she left the basketball court. Therefore, we can't conclude what her time of going to the court would be.\nStep 3: We know that Michael saw Jessica buying clothes at the mall from 5am to 6am, Steven saw Jessica buying a bike at the bike shop from 6am to 7am, Sean saw Jessica waiting at the train station from 7am to 2pm, and Elizabeth saw Jessica taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 2pm to 6pm. Therefore, we can conclude what time she left the basketball court: (C) 9pm to 10pm, since she must have spent until 10pm at the Eiffel Tower to take photos.\nStep 4: We can conclude her leaving the court, without the court being open. Since the court was closed after 10pm, it must have been between 9pm and 10pm.\nStep 5: Therefore, the only options are: (A) 6pm to 9pm, (C) 9pm to 10pm.",

            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "Between what times could Lisa have gone to the football field?\n\nWe must first consider the times that are not covered by the information we have. The only information we have that could possibly be relevant is:\n\"Today, Lisa went to the football field. Between what times could they have gone?\"\n\"Between what times could Lisa have gone to the football field?\"\nWe know that Lisa had to attend classes. And since we know that Lisa attended class from 10am to 1pm, this is the only time that is left.\nThe next option is between 1pm and 3pm (the time that David saw her). This means that, between the times that are left, Lisa had to attend class and then had some free time. The two only fit if she had some free time before attending class. But this is disproven by Emily who saw her waiting at the airport, before attending class, and the remaining time must be covered by \"between what times could Lisa have gone to the football field\".\nThe final answer is therefore (A) 1pm to 3pm. Good luck!",
