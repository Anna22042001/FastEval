Since we're dealing with sets of three, we know there must be at least one repetition (in other words, there's either a Blue book or an Orange book). Therefore, we can only remove one of the Blue and Orange books, leading us to possibility (C)\n\nMy reasoning has been influenced by the input I was given and my personal interpretation. However, I cannot guarantee the correctness of the given information nor the fitness of my processing for the specified task.\nIf I have misunderstood the question or if provided with inaccurate/incorrect information, this output may be wrong.

Mel finished a club above Ada.\n4. Mel finished a club above Ada.\n5. Ada finished a club above Mel.\n6. Ada finished a club above Mel.\n7. Ada finished a club above Mel.\n\nNow, the only possible finish order for these golfers (Mel finishes first, Ada second, and Mya last) is:\n\nMel finishes first. Ada finishes next (C).\n\nMel finishes first. Ada finishes next (C).\n\nAda finishes first. (This is the only way for Mel to finish third, so C must be the answer.)\n\nSo my final answer is (C).",

In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Mel, Ada, and Ana. Mel finished last. Ana finished second.\nOptions:\n(A) Mel finished last\n(B) Ada finished last\n(C) Ana finished last",
            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'll do that.\n\nLet's start by considering each paragraph separately.\n\nParagraph 1: When Ana and Ada started playing a game of chess, Ana had a pawn and Ada had a rook. While they were playing, Ana captured an Ada pawn, putting Ada in checkmate.\n\nIn this paragraph, Ana finished last by definition. Mel didn't play in the game so Mel didn't finish last either.\n\nLet's consider what could happen in the next paragraph.\n\nParagraph 2: The next day, Ada played Mel in a game of golf. Ada's score was better than Mel's, soMel finished last.\n\nIn this paragraph, it's possible that Ada finished last. However, Ada didn't finish last in the game of chess, which is the statement we have in the previous paragraph. Therefore this cannot be the case.\n\n Ada finished second in the game of golf so we can discard paragraph 2 and move to paragraph 3.\n\nParagraph 3: Mel, Ada, and Ana played golf together a few times. Mel's golf score was always higher than Ada's, so Mel finished last.\n\nThis paragraph has no connection to Ana and Ada's scores in the previous paragraph. Therefore this paragraph cannot be the correct answer.\n\nTherefore the answer to the problem is (B) Ada finished last.\n\nI will now proceed to output the answer. Ada finished last.\n\nI will not output the answer immediately since it is a wordy answer and the prompt indicates a one-liner answer.\n\nTherefore the answer is Ada finished last.",
