            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to clarify the answer step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the tone and wording of each option. Option A is obviously sarcastic, as it's saying the opposite of what the speaker actually means. Option B doesn't necessarily have a sarcastic tone, as it's just telling someone to be happy without any negative connotation. So the sarcastic tone is present in only one of the options, but not the other.\n\nSo, the answer must be B, as sarcastic tone is the defining characteristic.\n\nNow, let's consider the meaning of each option more carefully. option B is telling you to be happy for no reason other than not feeling depressed. This is different from being happy for a reason, as when you're happy for a reason, that reason is meaningful. To be happy for no reason means nothing is wrong or that there is no cause for happiness. This is the opposite of a reason being happy for something positive or meaningful (such as finishing a goal you've been working towards, getting a promotion at work, or finally finding out you have a health condition that has been causing you pain). Therefore, option B is sarcastic.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, **the answer to the given question is B**.",

            "model_answer": "To figure out which statement is sarcastic, we need to consider the tone and content of the statement, as well as any context that may clarify the meaning.\n\nFirst, let's look at the statement itself. \"He didn't threaten, he only urged\" and \"He didn't threaten, he only pleaded\" are both phrases that could be used to express concern or earnestness, but not necessarily in a sarcastic manner. They are both measured and factual.\n\nLet's consider the tone of the statement. The statement is made in response to another statement that implies the speaker is warning the other person about a serious consequence. Given this context, it is more likely that the statement is sarcastic.\n\nNext, let's look at any context that may clarify the meaning. We know that the other person is warning the speaker about a serious consequence, so we know that the statement is meant humorously. In addition, the use of phrases like \"he only pleaded\" and \"he only urged\" implies that the other person's statements were insincere, suggesting the original statement is also sarcastic.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the statement is likely sarcastic. Therefore, the answer is \"(A) He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different\".",

            "model_answer": "Okay, I understand. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, I would gather some information about the kind of containers used in takeout meals:\n- For option A, I would ask myself if I have ever had a takeout meal that used hardwood containers. I would think about if I have ever had any takeout from a restaurant that I can remember.\n- For option B, I would ask myself if I have ever had a takeout meal that used plastic containers. I would think about if I have ever had any takeout from a restaurant that I can remember.\n\n2. Now that I have that information, I can start to check for any possible sarcasm in the answer. To do this, I would check each option A statement. I would suspect that the answer is sarcastic if the restaurant had hardwood containers installed in the kitchen but used plastic for takeout. I would suspect it if the restaurant had plastic containers installed in the kitchen but used hardwood for takeout.\n\n3. Now I would check each option A statement mentioned. Wouldn't these be extremely rare circumstances? They would only be common if a restaurant made a special effort to use different kinds of materials for takeout food. It would even be difficult for the restaurant to know if the containers it used for takeout were also used for cooking other meals. It is hard to imagine any real situation like that happening.\n\n4. Therefore, I would suspect that option A is sarcastic. This would happen only if a random person were to ask this in a survey.\n\n5. Now I would check each option B statement. Also, I would suspect that option B is sarcastic. This would happen only if a random person were to ask this in a survey.\n\n6. Therefore, I can conclude that the answer is (A).

It is unlikely that a statement like this would come from a helpful source, and it's likely that the idea behind (B) is to shame you further for your poverty. The first statement (Have you tried not being poor?) is unlikely to be sarcastic, as if it was a legitimate statement it would not be associated with shame if you fail.

            "model_answer": "Okay, I understand the question. Here is my reasoning:\n\nStep 1: The statement \u201cYeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead\u201d is structured with an initial negative response (\u201cyeah\u201d) to a positive response (\"let's get rid of\"). It seems sarcastic to me because it's a snarky way of suggesting that something is a waste of time.\n\nStep 2: The phrase \u201cYeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead\u201d also has the same structure as statement 1. It's a negative response to a request for a better alternative to the tram system, and it seems even more sarcastic because it's a more extreme version of the same sentiment.\n\nStep 3: Based on these observations, I believe statement 1 is sarcastic.\n\nStep 4: The fact that the statement is sarcastic means it is spoken with a tone of sarcasm, which is a negative emotional attitude towards a situation, person, or action. The speaker does not necessarily believe what they are saying, but they are expressing derision (dislike and distrust).\n\nStep 5: Answering with \u201cA\u201d is the correct response because statement A is a sarcastic expression that is spoken with a tone of sarcasm.\n\nFinal answer: A.",

The statement would suggest that being over six feet is the height of all men, when in fact it is not. Therefore, it cannot be sarcastic.\n\n(B) He's over six feet, so he must be wonderful\n\nThis statement is also not sarcastic. It is a straightforward, positive statement. The use of the word \"wonderful\" suggests that the speaker holds the man in high regard. Again, if the statement was sarcastic, it would be ironic and mocking, but we don't see that here.\n\nSo we don't have any clues suggesting that the statement is either sarcastic or not sarcastic, so we can eliminate (B) and move on to the next statement.\n\n>(C) He's under six feet, so he must be short.\n\nThe problem with this statement is that it is not true. Being under six feet is not the same as being short. A smaller person may still be able to be tall.\n\nTherefore, we have eliminated (B) and (C) are the only two statements left.\n\nLet's look at (A) as well. We looked at it already and we know it cannot be sarcastic.
