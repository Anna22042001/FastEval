We can do this by subtracting the minimum value of each coordinate from the maximum value of each coordinate:\n\n$l = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\n$w = \\sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$\n\nNext, we need to find the area of the rectangle. We can do this by multiplying the length by the width:\n\n$A = l \\times w = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n\nFinally, we can find the probability that $x < y$ by dividing the area of the rectangle by the area of the square with vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$:\n\n$P(x < y) = \\frac{A}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 3} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTherefore, the probability that $x < y$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe answer is (A) $\\frac{1}{12}$.",

So, we can set up a system of equations to represent this relationship:\n\nN(10) = 3N(0)\n\nN(1) = 3N(0)\n\nWe can solve for N(1) in terms of N(0) by substituting the second equation into the first:\n\nN(1) = 3N(0) = 3(200) = 600\n\nSo, the number of bacteria after 1 full day is 600.\n\nStep 3: Check the answer choices\nNow, we can check the answer choices to see which one matches the number of bacteria after 1 full day.\n\n(A) 1160\n(B) 1440\n(C) 2408\n(D) 2793\n\nThe number of bacteria after 1 full day is 600, which is closest to (C) 2408.

Since both $p^2$ and $q^2$ are perfect squares, we have $p^2\\cdot q^2 = (p\\cdot q)^2 = 18n$.\n\nFinally, we can take the square root of both sides to get $\\sqrt{18n} = \\sqrt{18n\\cdot 34}$. Since both sides are integers, we have $18n = 18n\\cdot 34$.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $n = 34^2 = 1728$ is the least possible positive integer value of $n$ such that $\\sqrt{18n\\cdot 34}$ is an integer.\n\nHowever, we can simplify this further by noting that $18n\\cdot 34 = (2^2\\cdot 3^2)\\cdot (p^2\\cdot q^2) = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot (p^2\\cdot q^2) = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34 = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34 = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34 = 2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34 = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 18n\\cdot 34) = 18\\cdot (2^2",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) 792\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's start by using the information given in the problem to solve for the number of pins in each pile. We know that John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile, so the number of pins in that pile is 1/3 * 66 = 22.\n\nWe also know that the two piles had an equal number of pins, so the total number of pins in the two piles is 22 * 2 = 44.\n\nNow we can use the information that John had 66 pins left to solve for the number of pins in each pile. We know that John had 66 pins left, so he originally had 66 + 44 = 110 pins.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles to solve for the number of pins in each pile. We know that John had 66 pins left, so he originally had 110 pins / 2 = 55 pins.\n\nTherefore, the two piles had a total of 55 pins, so each pile had 55 / 2 = 27 pins.\n\nSo the answer is (A) 792, which means that John originally had 792 pins.",
