            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the passage and identify which statement about the period 600\u20131450 C.E. is supported by it.\n\nThe passage describes the copper mining industry in a kingdom, where ingots of crude copper are brought to a town called BYTY. The sultan Musa tells Al-Zawawi that the kingdom has a copper mine from which ingots are brought to BYTY. Al-Zawawi also states that the kingdom has a duty levied on crude copper, which is collected and sent to the land of the pagan Sudan to be sold for two-thirds of its weight in gold. The gold is extracted by digging pits about a man's height in depth, and the gold is found embedded in the sides of the pits or sometimes collected at the bottom of them.\n\nBased on this passage, we can conclude that:\n\n(A) Religions were often spread through warfare during the period.\n\nThe passage does not mention any wars or warfare being related to the spread of religions. Therefore, statement (A) is not supported by the passage.\n\n(B) International trade connections were still being developed in the period.\n\nThe passage does not mention any significant international trade connections being developed during the period. Therefore, statement (B) is not supported by the passage.\n\n(C) Diseases spread along trade routes.\n\nThe passage does not mention any diseases spreading along trade routes. Therefore, statement (C) is not supported by the passage.\n\n(D) Nomadic migrations created powerful empires during the period.\n\nThe passage does not mention any nomadic migrations creating powerful empires during the period. Therefore, statement (D) is not supported by the passage.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that statement (A) is not supported by the passage. Therefore, the answer to the question is (D).\n\nThe answer with parenthesis is (D).",

Strong drink and games of chance and idols\u2026 are only an infamy of Satan's handiwork. Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed.\" from Sura 5 of the Qur'an, is a clear warning against the dangers of alcohol and other forms of gambling. The verse is directed at Muslims who may be tempted to engage in these activities.\n\nThe second verse, \"The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m\" is a poem that celebrates the pleasures of life and the beauty of nature. It does not mention alcohol or gambling.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the Information\nTo determine which conclusion best supports the idea that many Muslims were inclined toward atheism in the premodern era, we need to compare the two verses. The Qur'an verse is directed at Muslims who may be tempted to engage in sinful behavior, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse is a celebration of life and nature. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Qur'an verse would be used to support the idea that many Muslims were inclined toward atheism.\n\nStep 4: Determine the Answer\nBased on the analysis of the information, the best conclusion that supports the idea that many Muslims were inclined toward atheism in the premodern era is (D) religious restrictions were not universally observed by all Muslims. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the Qur'an verse is a warning against the dangers of sinful behavior, while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t verse is a celebration of life and nature. Therefore, it is more likely that Muslims who were inclined toward atheism would be more likely to ignore the Qur'an verse and engage in sinful behavior.",
