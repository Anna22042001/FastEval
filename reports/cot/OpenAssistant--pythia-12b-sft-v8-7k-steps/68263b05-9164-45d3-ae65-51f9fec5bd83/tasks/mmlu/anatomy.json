            "model_answer": "(A) External and internal intercostal muscles\n\nDuring quiet inspiration, the external and internal intercostal muscles are normally active. These muscles are located between the ribs and run along the side of the body. They assist in breathing by moving the ribs and expanding the chest cavity, allowing for the lungs to expand and fill with air.\n\n(B) External intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nDuring quiet inspiration, the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are normally active. The diaphragm is a large muscle located below the lungs that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. It contracts during inspiration, pulling down on the lungs and expanding the chest cavity. The external intercostal muscles assist the diaphragm in moving down and expanding the chest cavity.\n\n(C) Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nDuring quiet inspiration, the internal intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are normally active. The internal intercostal muscles are located between the ribs and run along the side of the body. They assist in breathing by moving the ribs and expanding the chest cavity, allowing for the lungs to expand and fill with air. The diaphragm, as mentioned earlier, contracts during inspiration, pulling down on the lungs and expanding the chest cavity.\n\n(D) External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nDuring quiet inspiration, the external and internal intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are normally active. The external and internal intercostal muscles assist the diaphragm in moving down and expanding the chest cavity.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here's my explanation step-by-step:\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis, also known as the spheno-occipital fusion, is a cartilage structure located at the base of the skull (spheno-occipital synchondrosis) that fuses together with other cartilages to form the basis for the skull (spheno-occipital bone).\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a secondary growth cartilage, which means it is formed as a result of the endochondral ossification process. This process involves the conversion of cartilaginous templates into bone tissue.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis is an important structure in the skull as it provides support for the brain and allows for proper head and neck movements. It also helps to protect the brain from injury.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis ceases activity at 7 years of age, which means that it stops growing and fusing with other cartilages. This is a normal process that occurs as the skull develops and becomes more rigid.\n\nThe spheno-occipital synchondrosis can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly, a condition where the growth hormone is overactive. This can lead to an overgrowth of bones, including the skull, which can cause the spheno-occipital synchondrosis to continue growing and fusing with other cartilages.\n\nBased on the information provided, the answer to the question is (D) can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly.",
