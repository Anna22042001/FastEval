            "model_answer": "Individualism leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n\nIndividualism is the belief that the individual is the basic unit of society and that society should be organized around the individual. This can lead to a lack of integration and integrality in society.\n\nFor example, if an individual is solely focused on their own interests, they may not consider the interests of others and may not work together with others to achieve a common goal. This can lead to a lack of integration and integrality in society.\n\nIn contrast, collectivism emphasizes the importance of the group and the need for individuals to work together for the good of the group. This can lead to a more integrated and integral society.\n\nTherefore, individualism can lead to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n\n(A) It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n(B) They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.\n(C) It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods.\n(D) We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in \"tragedy of the commons\" situations.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the question\nThe question is: \"What is Philippa Foot's explanation of the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction?\"\n\nStep 2: Understand the distinction\nThe killing/letting die distinction is the idea that there are some cases where it is morally acceptable to kill someone, but not to let them die. For example, it is morally acceptable to kill a person who is about to commit suicide, but not to let them die if they are already in a vegetative state.\n\nStep 3: Consider Foot's explanation\nPhilippa Foot, a philosopher, has written about the killing/letting die distinction. She argues that the distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone. According to Foot, the distinction is relevant because it helps us to understand the moral significance of killing someone.\n\nStep 4: Choose between A, B, C, or D\nFoot's argument can be summarized in one of the following ways:\n\n(A) Rights of noninterference. According to Foot, the killing/letting die distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone because it helps us to understand the moral significance of killing someone.\n\n(B) Rights to goods and services. Foot also argues that the distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone because it helps us to understand the moral significance of killing someone.\n\n(C) Both A and B. Foot argues that the killing/letting die distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone because it helps us to understand the moral significance of killing someone.\n\n(D) Neither A nor B. Foot does not argue that the killing/letting die distinction is irrelevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone.\n\nStep 5: Choose the answer\nBased on the information above, the answer is (C) both A and B. Foot argues that the killing/letting die distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone because it helps us to understand the moral significance of killing someone. She also argues that the distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to use resources to keep someone alive when they would otherwise die.\n\nStep 6: Output the answer\nThe final answer is (C) both A and B. The killing/letting die distinction is relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to kill someone because it helps us to understand the moral significance of killing someone. It is also relevant to the moral issue of whether it is morally acceptable to use resources to keep someone alive when they would otherwise die.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity.\n\nKant argues that sexual use sacrifices humanity because it reduces people to mere objects for the sexual pleasure of others. However, this view is not universally accepted. Some argue that sexual use does not necessarily sacrifice humanity because it can also enhance personal relationships and provide emotional fulfillment.\n\n(B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.\n\nKant argues that the wrong of sexual objectification is not in reducing people to mere objects, but in treating them as things rather than persons. However, some argue that this view oversimplifies the issue and does not take into account the complex social and cultural factors that influence how people view and use each other sexually.\n\n(C) sexual objectification actually enhances humanity.\n\nThis view argues that sexual objectification can actually enhance humanity by promoting mutual respect and understanding between people. It can also help people to see each other in a more holistic and complex way, rather than just as sexual objects.\n\n(D) Papadaki actually agrees with Kant's view.\n\nPapadaki argues that sexual objectification can be wrong because it can reduce people to mere objects, and can lead to a culture of objectification and exploitation. However, this view is similar to Kant's in that it focuses on the individual harm caused by sexual objectification, rather than on the broader social and cultural factors that influence it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (D) Papadaki actually agrees with Kant's view.",
