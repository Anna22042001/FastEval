            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

The government provided subsidies to encourage the construction of railroads, and it also played a role in regulating the industry.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The entire national system was planned before the first railway was constructed. This means that the rail system was planned and developed before it was actually built. This is supported by the fact that the railroads were built to connect different regions of the country, and the government played a significant role in the planning and construction of the rail system.\n\nTherefore, the effect of the American rail system in the nineteenth century was significant.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the context in which Jimmy Carter made this speech. Carter was a Democrat who was elected President in 1976. At the time, the United States was facing a number of challenges, including the energy crisis, the Soviet Union's military buildup, and social and political changes in the developing world. Carter believed that these challenges required a global response, and he sought to create a new international organization to address these issues.\n\nOne of the key factors that Carter identified was the Soviet Union's military buildup. Carter believed that the Soviet Union was using its military power to intimidate its neighbors and to gain strategic advantage in the Cold War. Carter believed that the United States needed to respond to this challenge by increasing its own military power and by developing new strategies for dealing with the Soviet Union.\n\nTo address these challenges, Carter proposed the creation of a new international organization called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). NATO was designed to be a defensive alliance that would provide a counterweight to the Soviet Union's military power. Carter believed that NATO would help to stabilize the situation in Europe and to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating the continent.\n\nCarter's proposal for NATO was controversial, and it faced opposition from some members of Congress. Some argued that NATO was unnecessary and that the United States could handle the Soviet Union's military threat on its own. Others argued that NATO was a necessary step to ensure American security and to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating Europe.\n\nDespite these challenges, Carter's proposal for NATO was eventually approved by Congress and by the American people. NATO was officially created in April of 1949, and it has since become one of the most successful international organizations in history.\n\nIn summary, the situation Carter described in his State of the Union Address led most directly to the creation of NATO. Carter believed that the Soviet Union's military buildup and the social and political changes in the developing world required a global response, and he proposed the creation of NATO as a way to address these challenges. NATO has since become one of the most successful international organizations in history, and it has played a key role in stabilizing the situation in Europe and preventing the Soviet Union from dominating the continent.",

            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\n\"The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization\u2026.The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAll of the following were part of Johnson's Great Society program EXCEPT\n\n(A) the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n(B) Medicare and Medicaid\n(C) the establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\n(D) the balanced budget mandate",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the Great Society program and its goals. The Great Society program was a set of social and economic programs introduced by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s. The program aimed to address issues such as poverty, inequality, and racial injustice.\n\nThe program was divided into two parts: the War on Poverty and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The War on Poverty focused on providing economic assistance to low-income families and helping them find jobs. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to end racial segregation and discrimination.\n\nIn addition to these two parts, the Great Society program also included the establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, and the balanced budget mandate.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development was established to provide affordable housing for low-income families. Medicare and Medicaid were introduced to provide health insurance for older Americans and those with disabilities. The balanced budget mandate was aimed at reducing the national debt and promoting fiscal responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) the balanced budget mandate.",
