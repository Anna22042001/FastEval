This means that collective rights are not individual rights, but rather they are rights that belong to the group as a whole.\n\nCollective rights can be either collective or individual. Collective rights are those that are enjoyed by a group as a whole, such as the right to vote or the right to organize. Individual rights, on the other hand, are rights that belong to the individual members of the group, such as the right to privacy or the right to free speech.\n\nThe answer to the question is (D) Collective rights entail a right of the group as well as individual rights of the group's members. This means that collective rights are not just the rights of the individual members of the group, but they also include the right of the group as a whole to enjoy those rights.",

It does not say that international law is better than domestic law.\n\n(B) Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order\nThis answer also does not match the premise of monism.

Monism does not say that domestic laws are better than international law.\n\n(D) Monism posits that domestic and international law never clash\nThis answer matches the premise of monism.

In other words, a new rule of law should not be created if it is not necessary to achieve the objectives of the rule of law.\n\nIn order to determine which case best illustrates the living instrument principle used by the European Court of Human Rights, we need to examine the decisions of the Court and the legal reasoning behind them.\n\nIn Golder v UK (1978), the Court ruled that the UK had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by denying a German national the right to a fair trial. The Court held that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right that is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the UK had violated this right by denying the German national a fair trial.\n\nIn A v UK (2009), the Court ruled that the UK had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by denying a man the right to a family life, due to his sexuality. The Court held that the right to a family life is a fundamental right that is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the UK had violated this right by denying the man the right to form a family.\n\nIn Goodwin v UK (2002), the Court ruled that the UK had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by denying a man the right to a fair trial. The Court held that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right that is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the UK had violated this right by denying the man a fair trial.\n\nIn Osman v UK (1998), the Court ruled that the UK had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by denying a man the right to a fair trial. The Court held that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right that is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the UK had violated this right by denying the man a fair trial.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best case that illustrates the living instrument principle used by the European Court of Human Rights is Golder v UK (1978).

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) The doctrine of incorporation requires that all treaties undergo legislative transformation before they become domestic law\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation is a legal concept that states that international treaties and agreements are equivalent to domestic laws and are therefore enforceable in domestic courts. This doctrine is based on the idea that treaties are a form of international law that should be given the same legal effect as domestic law.\n\nTo incorporate a treaty into domestic law, it must be passed by a legislature and signed into law by the executive branch. This process is known as legislative transformation. The doctrine of incorporation requires that all treaties undergo this transformation before they become domestic law.\n\n(B) The doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation does not require any further action at the domestic level. Once a treaty is incorporated into domestic law, it becomes enforceable in domestic courts. There is no need for further action at the domestic level.\n\n(C) The doctrine of incorporation treats treaties as inferior to domestic law\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation treats treaties as inferior to domestic law. Domestic law is superior to international law, and domestic law takes precedence over international law. Therefore, treaties are not given the same legal effect as domestic law.\n\n(D) The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law\n\nThe doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law. Once a treaty is ratified, it becomes part of the domestic law of the country that ratified it. However, this does not mean that the treaty automatically becomes enforceable in domestic courts. The doctrine of incorporation requires that the treaty be incorporated into domestic law before it becomes enforceable.",

            "model_answer": "International legal personality refers to the status of entities under international law. There are three main theories of international legal personality: the State, the individual, and the group.\n\nThe State theory of international legal personality holds that only States are entitled to international legal personality. This means that only States have the right to appear before international courts, to make treaties, and to engage in diplomatic relations with other States. International legal personality is also associated with the idea that States have the primary responsibility for resolving international disputes and that international law applies only to States and not to individuals or groups.\n\nThe individual theory of international legal personality holds that individuals and groups have the right to international legal personality. This means that individuals and groups have the right to appear before international courts, to make treaties, and to engage in diplomatic relations with other States. International legal personality is also associated with the idea that individuals and groups have the primary responsibility for resolving international disputes and that international law applies to individuals and groups as well as to States.\n\nThe group theory of international legal personality holds that groups, such as corporations or organizations, have the right to international legal personality. This means that groups have the right to appear before international courts, to make treaties, and to engage in diplomatic relations with other States. International legal personality is also associated with the idea that groups have the primary responsibility for resolving international disputes and that international law applies to groups as well as to States.\n\nThe answer to the question is (D) It is a term that is meant to denote legal, as opposed to physical persons under international law.

The commission was led by French jurist Jean-Paul Badinter and was tasked with making recommendations to prevent future conflicts in the region.\n\nOne of the key recommendations made by the commission was that all disputes between the former Yugoslav republics should be submitted to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution.
