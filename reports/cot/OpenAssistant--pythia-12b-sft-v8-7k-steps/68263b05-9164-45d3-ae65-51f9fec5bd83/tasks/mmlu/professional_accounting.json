            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here's my reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the interest rate\nThe interest rate is calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12. So, the annual interest rate is 10% / 12 = 0.83 (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the compensating balance\nThe compensating balance is the difference between the credit limit and the amount borrowed. In this case, the credit limit is $500,000 and the amount borrowed is $200,000, so the compensating balance is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000\n\nStep 3: Calculate the effective annual interest cost\nThe effective annual interest cost is the total interest paid over the life of the loan, divided by the number of years. In this case, the loan is for one year, so the effective annual interest cost is:\n\n$500,000 * (0.83 * 12) / 1 = $500,000 * $54,000 = $31,800\n\nStep 4: Choose the answer with the closest effective annual interest cost\nThe answer with the closest effective annual interest cost is (D) 13.53 percent.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the problem\nThe problem is that Rune has two checks that are not included in the December 31 checkbook balance. These checks are a $1000 check deposited December 15 and a $4000 check postdated January 3. We need to find the amount of cash that Rune should report as having on hand on December 31.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the cash on hand\nWe know that the $4000 check is not included in the December 31 checkbook balance. Therefore, we can subtract it from the total amount of the checks that are included in the balance. This gives us $10000 - $4000 = $6000.\n\nStep 3: Find the cash on hand from the redeposited check\nWe also know that the $1000 check was returned by the bank on December 30 and redeposited on January 2. Therefore, we can subtract the amount of the returned check from the total amount of the new check. This gives us $6000 - $1000 = $5000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the cash on hand from the deposited check\nWe don't know the amount of the $1000 check that was deposited December 15. However, we do know that it was included in the December 31 checkbook balance. Therefore, we can add it to the amount of the returned check. This gives us $5000 + $1000 = $6000.\n\nStep 5: Report the cash on hand on the December 31 balance sheet\nThe final step is to report the amount of cash on hand on the December 31 balance sheet. Since the problem states that Rune should report the amount as a single letter with parenthesis, we can simply report the amount as (C) $13,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) $13,000.",

In this case, Strom invested $16,000 in Ace, so her basis in Ace is $16,000.\n\nStep 2: We need to calculate Ace's adjusted basis.\n\nAdjusted basis is the original basis of the contributed property, adjusted for any liabilities. In this case, the contributed land had an adjusted basis of $16,000, so Ace's adjusted basis is $16,000.\n\nStep 3: We need to calculate the total basis of Ace.\n\nTotal basis is the sum of the partner's basis and the adjusted basis of the partnership property.

In this case, the weights are 0.2 for Stock A and 0.3 for Stock B, since they represent 20% and 30% of the portfolio, respectively.\n\nSo the expected return on the market is:\n\nExpected return on the market = (0.2 x 0.8) + (0.3 x 1.4) = 0.6 + 1.8 = 1.4%\n\nStep 2: Calculate the risk-free rate\nThe risk-free rate is the return that an investor can earn on a risk-free investment, such as a government bond. In this case, the risk-free rate is the difference between the expected return on the market and the risk-free rate.\n\nSo the risk-free rate is:\n\nRisk-free rate = 1.4% - 7% = 8.6%\n\nStep 3: Calculate the required rate of return\nUsing the CAPM formula, the required rate of return for a stock is:\n\nRequired rate of return = (r - rf) / (beta - 1)\n\nwhere r is the expected return on the stock, rf is the risk-free rate, and beta is the beta of the stock.\n\nSo for Stock A:\n\nr = 0.8 x 1.4 = 1.28%\nrf = 8.6 = 8.6\nbeta = 0.8\n\nRequired rate of return for Stock A = (1.28 - 8.6) / (0.8 - 1) = 9.4%\n\nFor Stock B:\n\nr = 1.4 x 1.4 = 2.76%\nrf = 8.6 = 8.6\nbeta = 1.4\n\nRequired rate of return for Stock B = (2.76 - 8.6) / (1.4 - 1) = 11.2%\n\nSo the correct answers are (A) 9.4% and 11.2%.",
