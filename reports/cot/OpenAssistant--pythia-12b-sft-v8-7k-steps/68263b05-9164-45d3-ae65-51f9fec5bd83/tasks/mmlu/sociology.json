They found that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. They also found that self-reported depression was highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. However, they found that men and women had fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. Finally, they found that men were more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer\nBased on the information given in the study, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support\n\nExplanation:\n\nBrown & Harris (1978) found that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. This means that women who have more social support are less likely to experience stress and depression.\n\nStep 5: Check for any errors in the answer\nThere are no obvious errors in the answer.\n\nStep 6: Determine the final answer\nThe final answer is:\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support\n\nStep 7: Output the final answer\nThe final answer is:\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the thesis of the argument\nThe argument is that the embourgeoisement thesis suggests that the capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority, the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life, white collar occupations are being deskilled by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace, and there are no longer any distinct social classes.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the evidence for each of the suggested outcomes\n\nCapitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority: This is suggested by the fact that many large corporations have replaced traditional capitalist management with salaried managers with bureaucratic authority. For example, many large corporations have adopted the \"matrix\" model, which involves dividing employees into different departments with different managers, rather than having a single manager overseeing all employees.\n\nThe affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life: This is suggested by the fact that many middle-class jobs, such as those in the healthcare and education sectors, have become more prestigious and well-paying over time. Additionally, many affluent individuals have adopted middle-class values and ways of life, such as by eating out at restaurants and buying expensive clothing.\n\nWhite collar occupations are being deskilled by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace: This is suggested by the fact that many white-collar jobs, such as those in the tech industry, require less technical expertise and are more focused on problem-solving and collaboration than on technical skills. Additionally, many white-collar jobs have been deskilled by the introduction of new technologies, such as by using automated systems to perform tasks that were once done by humans.\n\nThe class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes: This is suggested by the fact that many people do not fit into traditional social classes, such as by being part of the \"new middle class\" or the \"affluent working class.\" Additionally, many people do not fit into traditional social classes, and there are many people who are part of multiple social classes.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence\nBased on the evidence, the conclusion that can be drawn is that the embourgeoisement thesis suggests that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority, the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life, white collar occupations are being deskilled by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace, and the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer to the question\nThe answer to the question is (A) capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) affectual\n\nWeber's theory of social action is based on the idea that human behavior is motivated by the desire to achieve certain goals or objectives. According to Weber, people engage in social action in order to achieve certain outcomes or results. Weber identified four ideal types of social action, which he referred to as the \"ideal types of action.\" These ideal types are:\n\n1. Instrumentally-rational\n2. Value-rational\n3. Traditional\n4. Affectual\n\nThe affectual type of social action is the least common of Weber's ideal types. According to Weber, the affectual type of social action is characterized by a lack of motivation or purpose. People who engage in affectual action do not have a clear goal or objective in mind. Instead, they act out of a sense of personal pleasure or enjoyment.\n\nIn the case of the question, the answer is (A) affectual. This means that the person is motivated to act by a sense of personal pleasure or enjoyment, rather than by a desire to achieve a specific goal or objective.",

This means that the men in the study have rediscovered their sense of self and have become re-energized. The study does not mention anything about unemployment or full-time work.
