He should feel moderate grief, but in a controlled and dignified manner.\n\n(C) undisturbed.\n\nThis is because Epictetus believes that a virtuous man should not be disturbed by the loss of his loved ones, but should remain calm and composed. He should not feel envy or bitterness towards those who still have their loved ones.\n\n(D) envy of those who still have their loved ones.\n\nThis is incorrect. Epictetus does not believe that a virtuous man should feel envy towards those who still have their loved ones.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the moral rule that applies to the action in question.\n\nAccording to Baier's theory, the moral rule that applies to an action is the one that the individual or group considers to be binding on them. This could be a religious rule, a cultural rule, or a personal moral code.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the moral rule forbids the action.\n\nTo do this, we need to look at the specific moral rule that applies to the action in question. If the rule forbids the action, then it is not morally permissible to take that action.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the moral rule is a genuine moral rule.\n\nA moral rule is genuine if it is based on moral principles that are widely accepted by the group or individual. If the moral rule is not widely accepted or is based on arbitrary or subjective principles, then it is not a genuine moral rule.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the action is forbidden by a law.\n\nIf the action is forbidden by a law, then it is not morally permissible to take that action. However, laws can be based on moral rules, so this is not a sufficient condition for moral permissibility.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether one can approve of the action.\n\nIf one can approve of the action, then it is not morally permissible to take that action. However, this is not a necessary condition for moral permissibility.\n\nNow, let's move on to the answer:\n\n(D) whether one can approve of it.\n\nBased on the above steps, we can determine that the answer is (D). If one can approve of the action, then it is not morally permissible to take that action, and therefore it cannot be morally permissible according to Baier's theory. Therefore, the answer is (D).",

They don't feel any desire or need for anything else. This is in contrast to (B) a continual progress of desire from one object to another, which suggests that people are constantly seeking something else. (C) a state of contemplation does not seem to fit the description of felicity, as it suggests a lack of activity.

They do not know their place in society, their natural abilities, or their initial position in the social hierarchy. This ignorance is designed to eliminate any biases or preferences that individuals may have and to ensure that the principles of justice are applied in an impartial manner.\n\nStep 2: The principles of justice\nThe principles of justice are a set of moral principles that guide the distribution of social goods in the original position. They are designed to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to improve their position and that the distribution of social goods is fair and just. The principles of justice include:\n\n1. Each person has an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others.\n2. Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that to the greatest extent possible, they are the result of free and fair agreements among persons with equal liberty and power.\n3. The social and economic inequalities resulting from such agreements are to be so arranged that they are both:\n(a) to the greatest extent possible consistent with the just savings principle, just to the greatest extent practicable; and\n(b) of equal benefit to all, just to the greatest extent practicable.\n\nStep 3: The problem of determining the optimal utilitarian policy\nThe problem of determining the optimal utilitarian policy is that the parties in the original position do not know which policies will maximize happiness. They must make decisions based on the best available information, but they do not have access to that information. This creates a dilemma: if the parties accept utilitarianism, they must accept whatever policy maximizes happiness, regardless of its moral implications. If they reject utilitarianism, they must reject the optimal policy, even if it is the policy that maximizes happiness.\n\nStep 4: The reasons why the parties would not accept utilitarianism\nThe parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism for the following reasons:\n\n(A) It is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness. The parties do not know which policies will be most effective in promoting happiness, and they must make decisions based on the best available information, but they do not have access to that information. This creates a dilemma: if the parties accept utilitarianism, they must accept whatever policy maximizes happiness, regardless of its moral implications. If they reject utilitarianism, they must reject the optimal policy, even if it is the policy that maximizes happiness.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the parties in the original position would not accept utilitarianism because it is too difficult to determine which policies would maximize happiness and it requires them to do unjust things, such as executing innocent people.",
