This means that when an element ejects a beta particle, the atomic number of that element increases by 2.\n\nStep 3: Reasoning\nTo understand why this is the case, we need to consider what happens when an element emits a beta particle. When an element emits a beta particle, it loses one electron and becomes a beta particle itself. This means that the atomic number of the element decreases by 1. However, the atomic number of an element can only decrease by a whole number, so if it loses one electron, it must gain another one to make the atomic number whole again. This means that the atomic number of the element must increase by 2.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nBased on the reasoning in step 3, the correct answer to the question is (D) \"increases by 2\".",

However, we can assume that the light is white, which means it's a mixture of all colors.\n\nStep 3: Determine the color of the petals\n\nThe petals of the rose are red, so the color of the light must be different from the color of the petals.

When an aircraft moves faster than the speed of sound, it is said to be flying at supersonic speed. Supersonic speed is defined as being faster than the speed of sound in the air.\n\nThe sonic boom is a result of the shock wave that is produced when the aircraft moves through the air at supersonic speed. The shock wave is a high-pressure area that is created by the sudden change in air pressure that occurs when the aircraft moves through the air. The shock wave can be heard as a loud noise that is produced by the sudden expansion of the air as the pressure increases.\n\nThe sonic boom is a dangerous phenomenon that can cause damage to the aircraft and to people and property on the ground. It is a result of the high-speed movement of the aircraft through the air, and it can cause severe damage to the aircraft and to people and property on the ground.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) breaking the sound barrier.",

If most of the energy is released in the form of gamma radiation, then that would support (A) as the correct answer. If most of the energy is released as kinetic energy of the alpha particle or the neutron, then (B) or (C) would be the correct answers.\n\nStep 4: Use logic to make a conclusion\nIf most of the energy is released as gamma radiation, then the amount of energy released would be relatively small compared to the total energy of the reactants. This means that the fusion reaction would be relatively slow and would not produce a large amount of heat. This is consistent with the fact that fusion reactions are typically used to produce nuclear power, which is done by using the heat generated by the fusion reaction to produce steam and then using the steam to turn a turbine.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\nBased on the above reasoning, the most likely form of energy released in a fusion reaction that converts a pair of hydrogen isotopes to an alpha particle and a neutron is (A) gamma radiation.
