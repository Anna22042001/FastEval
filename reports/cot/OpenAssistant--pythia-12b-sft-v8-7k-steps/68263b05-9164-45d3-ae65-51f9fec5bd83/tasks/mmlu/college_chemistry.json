We also know that Tl has a nuclear spin of 1/2.\n\nSo, we can calculate the magnetic moment as follows:\n\nM = (79 * 1.0625) / (1/2 * 1.0)\nM = 79.0375 x 10^-26 J T-1\n\nStep 2: Convert to a decimal\nWe need to convert this magnetic moment from J T-1 to J kg-1 to make it more useful. We can do this by dividing by the Avogadro constant (6.022 x 10^23) and by the mass of one atom (1.6 x 10^-24 kg).\n\nSo, the magnetic moment of 205Tl is:\n\nM = (79 * 1.0625) / (6.022 x 10^23 * 1.6 x 10^-24 kg) / (1/2 * 1.0)\nM = 1.734 x 10^-25 J kg-1\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer\nNow we need to compare the magnetic moments of the four options given in the question.\n\nOption A: [\u0263 (205TI = 1.569 x 108 T-1 s-1, I = \u00bd]\nThe magnetic moment of 205Tl is [\u0263], which is the symbol for a gamma ray. gamma rays have a magnetic moment, but they are not the same as the magnetic moment of a substance.\n\nOption B: 0.717 x 10^-26 J T-1\nThis is the magnetic moment of 205Tl as calculated in step 2.\n\nOption C: 0.827 x 10^-26 J T-1\nThis is the magnetic moment of 205Tl as calculated in step 2.\n\nOption D: 1.433 x 10^-26 J T-1\nThis is the magnetic moment of 205Tl as calculated in step 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) 1.433 x 10^-26 J T-1",

We can use the fact that the splitting is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the inverse of the chemical shift.
