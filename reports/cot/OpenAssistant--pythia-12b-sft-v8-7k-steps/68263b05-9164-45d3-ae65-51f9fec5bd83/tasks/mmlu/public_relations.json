            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, we need to consider the nature of the issue and the type of communication being used.\n\nFirst, let's consider the nature of the issue. If the issue is complex or emotional, interpersonal communication may be most effective in forming or changing predispositions. This is because interpersonal communication allows for face-to-face interaction between individuals, which can help to build trust and understanding.\n\nIf the issue is more factual or objective, media communication may be more effective. Media communication can reach a wider audience and can be used to present information in a clear and concise manner.\n\nGroup communication may be effective in forming or changing predispositions if the issue is related to group identity or values. Group communication can help individuals to identify with a group and can help to reinforce group-based predispositions.\n\nPublic communication may be effective in changing predispositions if the issue is related to public policy or social norms. Public communication can influence public opinion and can help to change attitudes and behaviors.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue would likely be interpersonal communication if the issue is complex or emotional, and media communication if the issue is more factual or objective. Group communication may be effective if the issue is related to group identity or values, and public communication may be effective if the issue is related to public policy or social norms.",

The sentence is \"According to Esman (1972), which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance?\"\n2. \"Publics\" refers to a group of people or organizations that help an organization to exist.\n3. Esman (1972) argues that there are four publics that can help an organization to exist: enabling, functional, normative, and diffused.\n4. The question is asking for the public that helps an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance.\n5. According to Esman (1972), enabling publics help an organization to exist by providing resources or support.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) enabling.\n7.
