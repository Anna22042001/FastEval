            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial potential energy of the system\nThe initial potential energy of the system is the energy that the mass has due to its position relative to its equilibrium position. We can calculate this by finding the difference between the mass's position and its equilibrium position, which is 0.030 m.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the initial kinetic energy of the system\nThe initial kinetic energy of the system is the energy that the mass has due to its motion relative to the spring.

In an atom, the electron has a set of quantum numbers that describe its energy, momentum, and other properties. One of these quantum numbers is m_l, which describes the projection of the electron's angular momentum onto the z-axis. In a single-electron atom, the electron has no angular momentum, so m_l is always equal to 0.\n\nStep 2:\nNow, let's consider the l = 2 state. In this state, the electron has a total angular momentum of 2, which can be represented by the quantum number m_l. The allowed values of m_l for this state are either 0 or 2.\n\nStep 3:\nTo determine the number of allowed values of m_l, we need to consider the symmetry of the l = 2 state. In a single-electron atom, the electron has no spin, so it can only have a total angular momentum of 0 or 2. The total angular momentum of 0 can only be represented by m_l = 0, while the total angular momentum of 2 can only be represented by m_l = 2.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, the number of allowed values of m_l for the l = 2 state is either 0 or 2. The correct answer is (B) 2.\n\nStep 5:\nTo summarize, the number of allowed values of the quantum number m_l is either 0 or 2. The correct answer is (B) 2.\n\nAnswer: (B) 2",
