            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here's my reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Define the problem\nThe problem is that the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes. This means that the stars are too close together to be resolved by your eyes.\n\nStep 2: Determine the angular resolution of your eyes\nThe angular resolution of your eyes is the minimum angle between two resolvable objects. This can vary depending on factors such as your distance from the objects and your visual acuity. However, for most people, the angular resolution is around 0.1 degrees.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the minimum angular separation required for two stars to be resolvable\nTo determine the minimum angular separation required for two stars to be resolvable, we need to divide the angular resolution of your eyes by the separation between the stars. This gives us the minimum angle between the stars required for them to be resolvable.\n\nAssuming the stars are separated by an angle of 0.1 degrees, the minimum angular separation required for them to be resolvable would be:\n\n0.1 degrees / 2 = 0.05 degrees\n\nStep 4: Determine the appearance of the stars\nIf the angular separation of the stars is smaller than the minimum resolvable angle, then they will not be resolvable and will appear as a single point of light.\n\nStep 5: Determine the answer\nBased on the above, the answer to the question is (A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.",

Saturn's atmosphere has a more uniform circulation pattern, with bands of circulation that move in a more consistent direction. Jupiter's atmosphere, on the other hand, has a more complex circulation pattern with bands of circulation that move in different directions at different latitudes.

            "model_answer": "(A) In the beginning when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula.\n\nThe protoplanetary disk was the first stage of the formation of the solar system. It was a rotating disk of gas and dust that surrounded the young Sun. The disk was made up of gas and dust particles that were rotating around the Sun in a clockwise direction. As the disk rotated, the lighter particles (such as hydrogen and helium) were thrown outward, while the heavier particles (such as metals) were thrown inward. This process is known as the \"centrifugal force\" effect.\n\n(B) In the inner part of the nebula only metals and rocks were able to condense because of the high temperatures whereas hydrogen compounds although more abundant were only able to condense in the cooler outer regions.\n\nThis is not correct. Both hydrogen and helium were present in the protoplanetary disk, and both were able to condense into more complex molecules. The difference was in the temperature. In the cooler outer regions of the disk, the temperatures were too low for the molecules to form, but in the inner regions, the temperatures were higher, allowing the molecules to form.\n\n(C) Denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula.\n\nThis is correct. The denser materials, such as metals, sank to the center of the protoplanetary disk, while the lighter materials, such as hydrogen and helium, were thrown outward. This process is known as the \"centrifugal force\" effect.\n\n(D) When the solar nebula formed a disk materials naturally segregated into bands and in our particular solar system the denser materials settled nearer the Sun while lighter materials are found in the outer part.\n\nThis is also not correct. The materials in the solar nebula were not segregated into bands, but rather were mixed together in a uniform distribution. The Sun and its planets formed from the densest materials in the nebula, which were concentrated in the center. The lighter materials, such as hydrogen and helium, were distributed more evenly throughout the nebula.",
