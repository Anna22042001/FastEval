            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of GARCH models and how they relate to financial asset return time-series.\n\nA GARCH model is a type of time-series model that is used to model the volatility of a financial asset return time-series. The GARCH model consists of two parts: a GARCH component and a moving average component.\n\nThe GARCH component is used to model the volatility of the time-series. It consists of two parts: a GARCH component and a moving average component. The GARCH component is used to model the conditional variance of the time-series, while the moving average component is used to model the conditional mean of the time-series.\n\nThe moving average component is a simple moving average of the time-series, where the average is taken over a certain number of time-steps. The GARCH component is more complex, as it models the conditional variance of the time-series using a recursive formula.\n\nNow, when it comes to which of the features of financial asset return time-series could be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model, we need to consider the features listed in the question.\n\nFeature (i) is \"fat tails in the return distribution\". Fat tails refer to the phenomenon where the tail of the return distribution is heavier than a normal distribution. This can cause extreme returns to be more likely than would be expected under a normal distribution.\n\nFeature (ii) is \"leverage effects\". Leverage effects refer to the phenomenon where the returns of an investment are magnified by the use of borrowed money. This can cause the returns to be higher than they would be if the investment were not leveraged.\n\nFeature (iii) is \"volatility clustering\". Volatility clustering refers to the phenomenon where the volatility of an asset's returns is correlated with the volatility of other assets. This can cause the volatility of an asset's returns to be higher than it would be if the volatility of other assets were not correlated with it.\n\nFeature (iv) is \"volatility affecting returns\". Volatility affecting returns refers to the phenomenon where the returns of an asset are affected by the volatility of the asset's returns. This can cause the returns to be higher or lower than they would be if the volatility of the asset's returns were not affecting them.\n\nNow, when we consider these features in relation to a standard GARCH(1,1) model, we can see that it would be able to capture some of them. However, it would not be able to capture all of them.\n\nFeature (i) and (iv) are both related to the fat tails of the return distribution. A standard GARCH(1,1) model would not be able to capture this feature, as it only models the conditional variance of the time-series and not the fat tails of the distribution.\n\nFeature (ii) and (iii) are both related to the volatility of the returns. A standard GARCH(1,1) model would be able to capture this feature, as it models the conditional variance of the time-series and can capture the volatility of the returns.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) (i), (ii), and (iii) only. This means that a standard GARCH(1,1) model would be able to capture the fat tails of the return distribution and the volatility of the returns. However, it would not be able to capture the leverage effects and the volatility affecting returns.",

If the errors in the data are homoscedastic (i.e., have the same variance), we can use a simple linear regression model to estimate the relationship between height and age. However, if the errors are heteroscedastic, we would need to use a more complex model that takes into account the varying variance of the errors.\n\nTo test for heteroscedasticity, we can use a variety of statistical tests, such as the Breusch-Pagan test or the Durbin-Watson test.
