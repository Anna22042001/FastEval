            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) 62%\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2017, approximately 62% of Americans lived in urban areas. This is because urban areas are defined as areas with a population of at least 50,000 people and a density of at least 1,500 people per square kilometer.\n\n(B) 72%\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf we were to adjust the criteria for what constitutes an urban area to include areas with a population of at least 100,000 people and a density of at least 2,500 people per square kilometer, then the percentage of Americans living in urban areas would increase to 72%. This is because there are many larger cities in the United States, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, that meet these criteria.\n\n(C) 82%\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf we were to further adjust the criteria to include areas with a population of at least 500,000 people and a density of at least 3,000 people per square kilometer, then the percentage of Americans living in urban areas would increase to 82%. This is because there are many very large cities in the United States, such as Phoenix, Dallas, and San Antonio, that meet these criteria.\n\n(D) 92%\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf we were to adjust the criteria even further to include areas with a population of at least 1,000,000 people and a density of at least 4,000 people per square kilometer, then the percentage of Americans living in urban areas would increase to 92%. This is because there are many very large cities in the United States, such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, that meet these criteria. However, it is important to note that not all Americans live in urban areas, as some live in rural areas as well.",

            "question": "As of 2015, the global fertility rate was about\n\n(A) 1.5 children per woman\n(B) 2.5 children per woman\n(C) 3.5 children per woman\n(D) 4.5 children per woman",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the average number of children per woman\nThe global fertility rate is the average number of children per woman. We don't have the exact number, but we can estimate it based on some data. According to the World Bank, the global fertility rate was about 2.5 children per woman in 2015.\n\nStep 2: Check the answer choices\nIf the global fertility rate was about 2.5 children per woman in 2015, then the correct answer must be either (B) 2.5 children per woman or (D) 4.5 children per woman.\n\nStep 3: Check (B) 2.5 children per woman\nIf the global fertility rate was 2.5 children per woman, then the total fertility rate (the number of children a woman would have if she lived to the end of her childbearing years) would be about 3.0 children per woman. This is because the total fertility rate is calculated by adding the desired fertility rate (the number of children a woman would like to have) to the actual fertility rate (the number of children a woman has).\n\nStep 4: Check (D) 4.5 children per woman\nIf the global fertility rate was 4.5 children per woman, then the total fertility rate would be about 5.0 children per woman. This is because the total fertility rate is calculated by adding the desired fertility rate to the actual fertility rate.\n\nStep 5: Check (A) 1.5 children per woman\nIf the global fertility rate was 1.5 children per woman, then the total fertility rate would be about 2.0 children per woman. This is because the desired fertility rate is calculated by subtracting the actual fertility rate from the total fertility rate.\n\nStep 6: Check (C) 3.5 children per woman\nIf the global fertility rate was 3.5 children per woman, then the total fertility rate would be about 4.0 children per woman. This is because the desired fertility rate is calculated by subtracting the actual fertility rate from the total fertility rate.\n\nStep 7: Choose the answer with the closest total fertility rate to 2.5 children per woman\nThe correct answer is (B) 2.5 children per woman. This is the closest total fertility rate to 2.5 children per woman, so it is the most likely answer.\n\nStep 8: Output the answer\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 2.5 children per woman. The final line should be:\n\n(B) 2.5 children per woman",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) 18%\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the fraction of the population in Brazil that used the internet in the past three months, we need to know the total population of Brazil in 2017. According to the United Nations, the population of Brazil in 2017 was approximately 212 million people.\n\nTo find the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months, we can divide the number of internet users by the total population and multiply by 100% to get a percentage:\n\nNumber of internet users / Total population of Brazil in 2017 x 100% = 18%\n\nTherefore, as of 2017, approximately 18% of the population in Brazil used the internet in the past three months.\n\n(B) 38%\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months, we can follow the same steps as before:\n\nNumber of internet users / Total population of Brazil in 2017 x 100% = 38%\n\nTherefore, as of 2017, approximately 38% of the population in Brazil used the internet in the past three months.\n\n(C) 58%\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months, we can follow the same steps as before:\n\nNumber of internet users / Total population of Brazil in 2017 x 100% = 58%\n\nTherefore, as of 2017, approximately 58% of the population in Brazil used the internet in the past three months.\n\n(D) 78%\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months, we can follow the same steps as before:\n\nNumber of internet users / Total population of Brazil in 2017 x 100% = 78%\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction greater than 100%, this answer is not possible.

According to the survey, the percentage of survey respondents from Mexico who reported having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services was (A) 31%.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the answer\nThe survey respondents were from Mexico, which is a country in North America. Therefore, the survey respondents are likely to be from the general population, not just from Mexico City or other urban areas. The survey also asked about a range of public services, including education, judiciary, medical and health, police, registry and permit services, utilities, tax revenue and customs, and land service.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) 6%\n\nObesity is a state of being overweight or having an excessive amount of body fat. In 2016, the percentage of adults aged 18 years or older who were obese was approximately 6%. This is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.\n\nTherefore, to determine the percentage of adults who were obese, we need to know the total number of adults aged 18 years or older and the number who were obese. In 2016, the CDC estimates that there were approximately 672 million adults aged 18 years or older in the United States.\n\nOut of these adults, approximately 33 million were obese.
