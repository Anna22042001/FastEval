In this case, the issue is whether the doctor was negligent in leaving the sponge in the patient's pelvis.\nStep 8: The plaintiff must therefore establish that the doctor was negligent in order to prove their case.\nStep 9: The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the doctor is (B) proximate cause.\nStep 10: Proximate cause means that the doctor's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the patient's injury.\nStep 11: The plaintiff must therefore establish that the doctor's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the patient's injury, in order to prove their case.\nStep 12: The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (C) res ipsa loquitur.\nStep 13: Res ipsa loquitur means that the injury is of a kind that would not normally occur without negligence.\nStep 14: The plaintiff must therefore establish that the injury is of a kind that would not normally occur without negligence, in order to prove their case.\nStep 15: The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (D) respondeat superior.\nStep 16: Respondeat superior means that the employer is liable for the actions of their employees, even if the employee was not acting within the scope of their employment.\nStep 17: The plaintiff must therefore establish that the doctor was acting within the scope of their employment, in order to prove their case.\nStep 18: The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (D) respondeat superior.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (D) respondeat superior.",
