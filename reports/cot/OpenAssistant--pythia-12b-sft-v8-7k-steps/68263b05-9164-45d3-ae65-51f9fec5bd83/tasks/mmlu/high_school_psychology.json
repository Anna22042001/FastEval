            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) Cannon-Bard\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Cannon-Bard theory of emotions suggests that emotions are caused by physiological changes in the body, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. In this scenario, Antoinette's heart rate and blood pressure would likely increase upon seeing her friends jump out towards her, which would be consistent with the Cannon-Bard theory.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Antoinette experiences a mix of emotions, which would not be fully explained by a single theory. For example, her initial reaction of shrieking could be explained by both the Cannon-Bard and James-Lange theories, as it would be a physiological response to the surprise and excitement.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that.\n\nTo begin with, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\n1. Dilation of the pupils:\nDilation of the pupils is one of the signs of physiological arousal. When we are excited or anxious, our bodies release adrenaline, a stress hormone. This causes the pupils to dilate, allowing more light to enter the eye and improve our vision.\n\n2. Increase in salivation:\nIncrease in salivation is another sign of physiological arousal. When we are excited or anxious, our bodies release adrenaline, which causes the glands in the mouth to produce more saliva. This saliva helps to moisten the mouth and throat, making it easier to swallow.\n\n3. Increase in perspiration:\nIncrease in perspiration is also a sign of physiological arousal. When we are excited or anxious, our bodies release adrenaline, which causes the body to release heat. This heat is released through the skin, causing the body to perspire.\n\n4. Increase in secretion of stress hormones:\nIncrease in secretion of stress hormones is not a characteristic of physiological arousal. Physiological arousal is the body's response to a stressor, such as a threat or a challenge. It is characterized by physical changes, such as increased heart rate and breathing rate, as well as emotional changes, such as anxiety or excitement.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer to the question is (D) increase in secretion of stress hormones.\n\nNow, the final line:\nThe answer to the question is (D) increase in secretion of stress hormones.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the problem\nThe first step is to identify the problem. The question is asking about a breathing-related sleep disorder, which means that the individual is having trouble breathing while they are sleeping. This could be caused by a number of things, including sleep apnea, insomnia, or hypersomnia.\n\nStep 2: Determine the most likely diagnosis\nNext, we need to determine the most likely diagnosis. We can do this by looking at the symptoms listed in the question. The most common breathing-related sleep disorder is sleep apnea, which is characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Insomnia and hypersomnia are less common, and they are both characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer\nBased on the above, the most likely diagnosis for an obese individual with a breathing-related sleep disorder is sleep apnea. The word \"sleep\" in the question suggests that the disorder is related to sleep, and the word \"apnea\" suggests that the disorder is characterized by pauses in breathing.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis for an obese individual with a breathing-related sleep disorder is sleep apnea. The answer is (A).\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n(A) Narcolepsy",

She was not exposed to the charity or the address stickers repeatedly. She received one shipment of stickers and then mailed a donation to the organization that sent them.\n\nStep 6: Brittany's behavior illustrates the reciprocity norm.\n\nStep 7: The reciprocity norm is the tendency for people to return favors or engage in positive behavior in exchange for similar behavior from others.\n\nStep 8: Brittany's behavior is not consistent with the reciprocity norm. She did not engage in any positive behavior in exchange for the charity's help. She simply mailed a donation to them.\n\nStep 9: Brittany's behavior does not illustrate any of the other options.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) stereotyping. Brittany's behavior was based on a stereotype about how people who receive charity mailings should behave.
