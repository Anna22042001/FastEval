Which of the following is the most appropriate statement?\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155.\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the November donations.\nThe mean of the November donations is $155 (100 checks x $155/check).\nThe standard deviation of the November donations is $32 (100 checks x ($155 - $155/2)^2/($155/check)^2).\n\nStep 2: Interpret the standard deviation.\nThe standard deviation is the amount by which the average donation in November varies from the mean. If the standard deviation is small, then the donations vary little from the mean. If the standard deviation is large, then the donations vary a lot from the mean. In this case, the standard deviation is $32, which means that the donations vary by about $32 from the mean.\n\nStep 3: Choose the most appropriate statement.\nThe most appropriate statement is (A) This November, the average donation is $155. This is the only statement that gives the exact value of the average donation. The other statements give ranges or confidence levels, but not the exact value.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer.\nThe answer is (A) This November, the average donation is $155. with a standard deviation of $32.",

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is about negotiating salaries for the coming year. The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the data\nWe need to analyze the salaries of all teachers and administrators in the district to determine the average salary. We can do this by calculating the mean, mode, standard deviation, and median of all the salaries.\n\nStep 3: Choose the answer\nBased on the problem, we need to choose the answer that would be most likely to be quoted by the teachers' union during negotiations.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the average salary\nThe mean of all the salaries would be the average salary in the district.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the salaries of teachers and administrators\nWe need to calculate the salaries of all teachers and administrators in the district. Let's say the salaries of all teachers are x, and the salaries of all administrators are y. Then the salaries of all teachers and administrators would be x + y.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the standard deviation of salaries\nThe standard deviation of salaries would be the average of the squared differences from the mean. The mean is the average salary, which is (x + y)/2. The squared differences from the mean are (x - (x + y)/2)^2 and (y - (x + y)/2)^2. So the standard deviation of salaries would be:\n\n(x - (x + y)/2)^2 + (y - (x + y)/2)^2\n\nStep 7: Calculate the mode of salaries\nThe mode of salaries would be the salary of the highest paid teacher or administrator in the district.\n\nStep 8: Choose the answer\nBased on the problem, we need to choose the answer that would be most likely to be quoted by the teachers' union during negotiations. The mean of all the salaries is the average salary in the district, which is the same as the salaries of teachers and administrators. The standard deviation of salaries is the average of the squared differences from the mean, which is higher than the mean. The mode of salaries is the salary of the highest paid teacher or administrator in the district, which is not necessarily the same as the average salary. Therefore, the teachers' union would most likely quote the mean of all the salaries.\n\nStep 9: Output the answer\nThe answer is (A), the mean of all the salaries.",

In order to use a \u03c72 procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.
