            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the complementary base pair\nThe first step is to identify the complementary base pair in the DNA strand. In this case, we can see that the first and last bases in the sequence are C and G, respectively. This means that the complementary base pair will be G-C.\n\nStep 2: Find the complementary sequence\nNext, we need to find the complementary sequence to the given DNA strand. Looking at the sequence, we can see that it starts with C and ends with G. Therefore, the complementary sequence will start with G and end with C.\n\nStep 3: Check the complementary sequence\nTo check if the complementary sequence is correct, we can substitute the bases in the complementary sequence into the given DNA strand. If the resulting sequence is the same as the original sequence, then the complementary sequence is correct.\n\nStep 4: Identify the correct answer\nBased on the above steps, the correct answer is (B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032. This is because the complementary sequence starts with G and ends with C, which matches the original sequence.\n\nSo the answer is (B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032.",
