            "model_answer": "Sure, I can do that. Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Check the date\nWe need to check the date to see if it is the 5-year anniversary. We can do this by subtracting 5 years from the date of their marriage. So, the date of their marriage is Jan 2, 1958. Subtracting 5 years from this date gives us Jan 2, 1943.\n\nStep 2: Check the date today\nToday is December 23, 2022. So, we need to subtract 5 years from this date to get the date of their anniversary. Subtracting 5 years from December 23, 2022 gives us December 23, 1897.\n\nStep 3: Check the date options\nWe can see from the options that the date of their anniversary is not option D (12/23/1960) or option E (01/03/1961). Therefore, the only option that matches the date of their anniversary is option A (01/02/1894).\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

December has only 31 days, so we can eliminate options (B) and (D).\n\nStep 2: Find the date one year ago from today\nWe know that today is 12/31/2019, so one year ago is 12/31/2018. We need to find the date in MM/DD/YYYY format.\n\nStep 3: Convert the date to MM/DD/YYYY format\nThe date is in the year 2018, so we need to subtract one year to get the date in the year 2019. We can do this by subtracting 1 from the current year (2019) and then adding 1 to the result (2018).\n\nStep 4: Find the date in MM/DD/YYYY format\nWe can use the formula for converting a year to a month and day:\n\nMM = (year - 1900) / 4 + month\n\nDD = day\n\nSo, to find the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, we can substitute the values we have into the formula:\n\nMM = (2019 - 1900) / 4 + 1 = 0.75\nDD = 31\n\nTherefore, the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY format is 01/01/1898.\n\nStep 5: Check the answer\nThe answer is (A) 01/01/1898, which matches the correct answer.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A) 01/01/1898",
