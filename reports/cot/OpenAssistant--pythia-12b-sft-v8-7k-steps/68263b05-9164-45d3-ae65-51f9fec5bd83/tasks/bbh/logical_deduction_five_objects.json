Here are the steps:\n\nStep 1: Read the question and identify the objects and their prices.\n\nThe question is about five objects arranged in a fixed order, and each paragraph describes one set of objects. The objects are: oranges, cantaloupes, peaches, loquats, and kiwis. The prices are not given.\n\nStep 2: Identify the logical relationship between the prices of the objects.\n\nThe prices are described in the following statements:\n- The peaches are more expensive than the oranges.\n- The cantaloupes are more expensive than the peaches.\n- The kiwis are the third-most expensive.\n- The loquats are the second-cheapest.\n\nStep 3: Determine the logical relationship between the prices of the objects in each paragraph.\n\nIn paragraph 1, we know that the peaches are more expensive than the oranges. Therefore, the oranges must be cheaper than the peaches.\nIn paragraph 2, we know that the cantaloupes are more expensive than the peaches. Therefore, the peaches must be cheaper than the cantaloupes.\nIn paragraph 3, we know that the kiwis are the third-most expensive. Therefore, the oranges must be cheaper than the kiwis.\nIn paragraph 4, we know that the loquats are the second-cheapest. Therefore, the kiwis must be cheaper than the loquats.\nStep 4: Determine the logical relationship between the prices of the objects in each paragraph.\n\nThe logical relationship between the prices in each paragraph is:\n- In paragraph 1, the oranges are cheaper than the peaches.\n- In paragraph 2, the peaches are cheaper than the cantaloupes.\n- In paragraph 3, the kiwis are cheaper than the loquats.\n- In paragraph 4, the kiwis are cheaper than the loquats.\n\nStep 5: Determine the cheapest object in each paragraph.\n\nThe cheapest object in each paragraph is:\n- In paragraph 1, the oranges are the cheapest.\n- In paragraph 2, the cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n- In paragraph 3, the kiwis are the cheapest.\n- In paragraph 4, the loquats are the cheapest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) The oranges are the cheapest.\n(B) The cantaloupes are the cheapest.\n(C) The peaches are the cheapest.\n(D) The loquats are the cheapest.\n(E) The kiwis are the cheapest.",
