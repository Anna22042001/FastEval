            "model_answer": "(A) Soggy fries covered in bacon grease sounds unhealthy\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"soggy fries covered in bacon grease sounds unhealthy\" is sarcastic because it is making a statement that is opposite to its literal meaning. The statement is suggesting that the food is unhealthy, when in fact it is actually quite unhealthy. The use of the word \"sounds\" is meant to be ironic, as the speaker is suggesting that the food is unhealthy, but the listener is expected to assume that it is actually healthy based on the way it sounds.\n\nAnswer: (A) Soggy fries covered in bacon grease sounds unhealthy",

            "model_answer": "(A) He's such terrible relationship material when he's drunk\n\nMy reasoning:\n\nThe statement \"He's such terrible relationship material when he's drunk\" is a sarcastic comment. It is a way of saying that the person being referred to is not good at relationships when they are drunk, which is obviously not true. The use of the word \"terrible\" implies that the person is extremely bad at relationships, which is not necessarily true. The statement is meant to be ironic and is meant to be taken humorously.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) He's such terrible relationship material when he's drunk.",

We can do this by looking at the words used.\n\nIn this case, the statement uses the word \"super\" which is often used to add emphasis to a statement. This suggests that the statement is being made in a sarcastic tone.\n\nStep 2: Identify the Person\nNext, we need to identify the person who is making the statement. Is it a general statement or is it a specific to a particular person or group of people?\n\nIn this case, the statement is a general statement that could apply to anyone.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the Words\nNow that we know the tone and person, we can analyze the words used in the statement.\n\nThe statement uses the phrase \"super sexist\" which is an example of sarcasm. The word \"sexist\" is often used to describe discrimination against women. However, in this case, the word is being used in a sarcastic way to suggest that the statement is being made in a way that is sexist.\n\nStep 4: Determine the Answer\nBased on the analysis of the words, we can determine that the statement is sarcastic.\n\nThe answer is (A).\n\nStep 5: Output the Answer\nThe final step is to output the answer with the appropriate symbols.

The statement is in the form of a question, which is a common way of expressing skepticism or irony.\n2. The word \"how\" implies that the answer will be a simple and straightforward one, which is unlikely to be true.\n3. The phrase \"Government control of the internet\" is a clear reference to a hypothetical scenario that is highly unlikely to happen in reality.\n4. The use of the word \"bad\" implies that the speaker or writer has a negative opinion or attitude towards government control of the internet.\n\nAnswer: (A) How could Government control of the internet be bad?\n\nThe answer is sarcastic because the statement is intended to be ironic or skepticism-inducing, rather than being a genuine question or opinion.",

Yeah, no one is rewatching\" which is a sarcastic response. The sarcastic response is option (A) which is a paraphrase of the original question.\n\nHowever, the statement \"It only received the highest gross sales for any recent action film.

It is much easier\" is a sarcastic response to the previous statement. It is a way of saying that the previous statement is difficult or impossible to achieve. The use of the word \"try\" implies that the previous statement is something that cannot be done.
