Here is my reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Identify the number of rows in the table.\nThere are 5 rows in the table, as indicated by the number of lines.\n\nStep 2: Identify the number of columns in the table.\nThere are 4 columns in the table, as indicated by the presence of the (cm) and (kg) units.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of values in each column.\nIn the first column, there are 2 values: Louis and Bernard. In the second column, there are 2 values: age and Vincent. In the third column, there are 2 values: height and Gwen. In the fourth column, there are 2 values: weight and 15.\n\nStep 4: Add up the number of values in each column.\nThe number of values in the first column is 2 + 2 = 4.

We have the name, age, height (cm), and weight (kg) of each penguin.\n3. We need to understand the criteria for the penguin we want to delete. We are given two criteria: the age must be more than 5 years old and the weight must be less than 12 kg.\n4. We can use these criteria to delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\n5. After Bernard is deleted, we have a new table with the same header but different data. We can now count the number of penguins that meet the criteria.\n6. We can do this by iterating through the data in the table and checking each penguin's age and weight. If the age is more than 5 years old and the weight is less than 12 kg, we can count that penguin as a match.\n7.
