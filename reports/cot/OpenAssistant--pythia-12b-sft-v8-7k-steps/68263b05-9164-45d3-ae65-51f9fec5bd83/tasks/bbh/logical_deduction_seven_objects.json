This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is less than the cost of buying any three of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least one of the following fruits must be cheaper than the pears: plums, mangoes, or oranges.\n\nLet's move on to the second paragraph.\n\nThe kiwis are the second-most expensive. This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is more than the cost of buying any two of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least two of the following fruits must be cheaper than the kiwis: plums, mangoes, or oranges.\n\nLet's move on to the third paragraph.\n\nThe pears are the third-cheapest. This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is less than the cost of buying any three of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least one of the following fruits must be cheaper than the pears: plums, mangoes, or oranges.\n\nLet's move on to the fourth paragraph.\n\nThe kiwis are the second-most expensive. This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is more than the cost of buying any two of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least two of the following fruits must be cheaper than the kiwis: plums, mangoes, or oranges.\n\nLet's move on to the fifth paragraph.\n\nThe pears are the third-cheapest. This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is less than the cost of buying any three of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least one of the following fruits must be cheaper than the pears: plums, mangoes, or oranges.\n\nLet's move on to the sixth paragraph.\n\nThe mangoes are the third-cheapest. This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is less than the cost of buying any three of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least one of the following fruits must be cheaper than the mangoes: plums, or oranges.\n\nLet's move on to the seventh paragraph.\n\nThe peaches are the second-cheapest. This means that the cost of buying all seven fruits is more than the cost of buying any two of the fruits. Therefore, we can conclude that at least two of the following fruits must be cheaper than the peaches: plums, or oranges.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is (G) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive.",

We can see that the plums are the cheapest, so we can eliminate option (F) and (G) since they are more expensive than the plums.\n\n4.
