We know that there are 365 days in a year, so if we subtract 365 days from yesterday's date, we should get the date one year ago.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Subtract 365 days from April 30, 2021:\nApril 30, 2021 - 365 days = April 29, 2020\n2. Now, we need to find the date one year ago from April 29, 2020. We can do this by subtracting 365 days again:\nApril 29, 2020 - 365 days = April 28, 2019\n3. Finally, we need to convert the date to the MM/DD/YYYY format. We can do this by rearranging the digits:\nApril 28, 2019 = 04/28/2019\n\nSo, the date one year ago from yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY format is:\n(D) 04/01/2020\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how I arrived at the answer!",
