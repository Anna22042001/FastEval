            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. We know that Ada finished above Ana, so Ada cannot have finished last. Therefore, option (C) Ada finished last can be eliminated.\n2. We also know that Mel finished below Ana, so Mel must have finished either second or third.\n3. Since Ada finished above Ana, Ana must have finished either second or third as well.\n4. Therefore, the only possible ordering of the three golfers is:\n\nAda - Mel - Ana\n\nSo, the answer is (B) Mel finished last.\n\n(B)",
