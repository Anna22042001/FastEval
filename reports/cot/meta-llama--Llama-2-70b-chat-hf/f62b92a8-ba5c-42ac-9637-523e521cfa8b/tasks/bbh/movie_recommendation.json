Here's my reasoning:\n\nApollo 13 is a historical drama film that tells the story of a space mission that goes wrong. Jurassic Park is a science fiction film that revolves around a theme park filled with cloned dinosaurs. Die Hard With a Vengeance is an action film that follows the story of a detective who must solve a series of puzzles to save the day. Forrest Gump is a historical drama film that tells the story of a man with a low IQ who finds himself involved in some of the most significant events of the 20th century.\n\nConsidering these descriptions, I would say that a movie similar to these four would be one that combines elements of action, adventure, drama, and possibly science fiction or historical events.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Killer Movie - This movie is a horror comedy that parodies slasher films. While it may have some elements of action and adventure, it doesn't seem to fit the criteria of being similar to the four movies mentioned.\n\n(B) Stealth - This movie is a science fiction action film that follows a military experiment that goes wrong. It has elements of action and adventure, but it doesn't seem to have the same historical or scientific themes as the other movies.\n\n(C) The Last Man on Earth - This movie is a science fiction film that follows a man who is the last human survivor of a worldwide plague. It has elements of adventure and drama, but it doesn't seem to have the same level of action as the other movies.\n\n(D) True Lies - This movie is an action comedy that follows a spy whose wife discovers his true identity. It has elements of action, adventure, and comedy, making it a good fit for the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) True Lies.\n\n(D) True Lies",
