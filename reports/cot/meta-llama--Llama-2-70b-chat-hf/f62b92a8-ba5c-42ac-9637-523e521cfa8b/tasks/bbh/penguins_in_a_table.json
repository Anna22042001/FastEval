The table has four columns: name, age, height (cm), and weight (kg). Each row represents a penguin, and there are four penguins in total.\n2. Next, I'll identify the penguins that meet the given criteria. The question asks for penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\nHow many penguins are more than 5 years old?\nOptions:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) 3\n(D) 4\n(E) 5",
            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the table:\n\n| name | age | height (cm) | weight (kg) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Louis | 7 | 50 | 11 |\n| Bernard | 5 | 80 | 13 |\n| Vincent | 9 | 60 | 11 |\n| Gwen | 8 | 70 | 15 |\n\nNow, let's read the question carefully: \"How many penguins are more than 5 years old?\"\n\nTo answer this question, we need to check the age of each penguin and count how many are older than 5 years.\n\nLet's start by checking the age of Louis: 7 years old. That's less than 5 years old, so we can't count Louis.\n\nNext, let's check the age of Bernard: 5 years old. That's less than 5 years old too, so we can't count Bernard either.\n\nNow, let's check the age of Vincent: 9 years old. That's more than 5 years old, so we can count Vincent.\n\nFinally, let's check the age of Gwen: 8 years old. That's also more than 5 years old, so we can count Gwen too.\n\nSo, out of the four penguins in the table, two are more than 5 years old: Vincent and Gwen.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) 2.\n\nI hope that helps!",
