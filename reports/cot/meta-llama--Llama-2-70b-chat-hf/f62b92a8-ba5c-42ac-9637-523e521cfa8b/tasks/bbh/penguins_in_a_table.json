We can find the height of each penguin in the third column of the table.\n\n* Louis is 50 cm tall.\n* Bernard is 80 cm tall.\n* Vincent is 60 cm tall.\n* Gwen is 70 cm tall.\n* James is 90 cm tall.\n\nSince we're looking for a penguin that is 60 cm tall, our options are:\n\n(C) Vincent\n(E) James\n\nHowever, we can eliminate option (E) James because he is 90 cm tall, not 60 cm tall.\n\nTherefore, the name of the 60 cm tall penguin is:\n\n(C) Vincent\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Vincent.",
