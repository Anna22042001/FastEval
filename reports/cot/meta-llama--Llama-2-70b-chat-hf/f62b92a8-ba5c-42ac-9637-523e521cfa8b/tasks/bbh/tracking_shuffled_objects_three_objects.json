So, Bob does not have Ulysses at the end of the semester.\n(B) Frankenstein: This is the book that Bob had after swapping with Claire. He then swapped it with Alice, so Bob does not have Frankenstein at the end of the semester.\n(C) Lolita: This is the book that Bob had at the start of the semester, and he swapped it with Claire.
