            "model_answer": "When it comes to adjective order, it's important to follow a specific pattern to ensure that the sentence is clear and easy to understand. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the correct adjective order for the two options given:\n\n1. Determine the noun: The first step is to identify the noun in the sentence. In this case, the noun is \"knife.\"\n2. Identify the adjectives: Next, identify the adjectives that describe the noun. For option A, the adjectives are \"snorkeling,\" \"iron,\" \"prismlike,\" \"orange,\" and \"midsize.\" For option B, the adjectives are \"midsize,\" \"prismlike,\" \"orange,\" \"iron,\" and \"snorkeling.\"\n3. Order the adjectives: Now, arrange the adjectives in the correct order. Generally, adjectives that describe the noun's size, shape, or material come first, followed by adjectives that describe the noun's color, and finally, adjectives that describe the noun's purpose or function.\n\nUsing this guideline, we can arrange the adjectives for option A as follows:\n\n* midsize (describes the size of the knife)\n* prismlike (describes the shape of the knife)\n* orange (describes the color of the knife)\n* iron (describes the material of the knife)\n* snorkeling (describes the purpose or function of the knife)\n\nFor option B, we can arrange the adjectives as follows:\n\n* midsize (describes the size of the knife)\n* prismlike (describes the shape of the knife)\n* orange (describes the color of the knife)\n* iron (describes the material of the knife)\n* snorkeling (describes the purpose or function of the knife)\n\n4. Compare the adjective orders: Now, compare the adjective orders for the two options. We can see that the adjective order for option A is not following the correct pattern, as \"snorkeling\" is placed last, even though it describes the purpose or function of the knife.\n\nOn the other hand, the adjective order for option B follows the correct pattern, with \"snorkeling\" placed before \"iron,\" which describes the material of the knife.\n\nTherefore, the correct sentence with the adjective order is:\n\n(B) midsize prismlike orange iron snorkeling knife\n\nSo, the answer is (B).",
