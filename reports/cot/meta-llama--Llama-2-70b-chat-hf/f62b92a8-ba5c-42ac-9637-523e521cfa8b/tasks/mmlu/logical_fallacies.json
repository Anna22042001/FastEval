The fallacy of reprehensible personality is a type of fallacy that involves attacking the character or personal qualities of an argument's proponent rather than addressing the argument itself.\n2. Begging the question is a type of fallacy that involves assuming the truth of the conclusion one is trying to prove, rather than providing evidence or logical reasoning to support it.\n3. In the case of the fallacy of reprehensible personality, the attack on the person making the argument is often used to distract from the fact that the argument itself has not been adequately addressed.\n4. Therefore, the fallacy of reprehensible personality can be seen as a form of begging the question, as it attempts to shift the focus away from the argument and onto the person making the argument, rather than providing a valid response to the argument itself.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Begging the question.",
