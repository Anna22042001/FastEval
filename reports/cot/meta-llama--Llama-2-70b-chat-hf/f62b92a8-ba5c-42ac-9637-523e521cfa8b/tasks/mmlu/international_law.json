            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe question asks whether individuals (physical persons) enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations.\n\nFirst, let's define what international legal personality means. International legal personality refers to the ability of an entity (in this case, an individual) to have legal rights and obligations under international law. This means that the entity can enter into legal relations with other entities, including States and international organisations, and can be held accountable for its actions under international law.\n\nNow, let's consider the different options:\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.\n\nThis option is partially correct. Individuals do have some international legal personality, but it is limited compared to that of States and international organisations. For example, individuals can bring claims before international human rights courts, but they do not have the same level of sovereignty as States.\n\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Individuals do not have unlimited international legal personality. Their international legal personality is limited to certain areas, such as human rights, and they do not have the same level of sovereignty as States.\n\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Individuals do have some international legal personality, as mentioned earlier.\n\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts.\n\nThis option is incorrect. While individuals can bring claims before international courts, they also have other rights and obligations under international law, such as the right to protection from torture and the obligation to respect human rights.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.\n\n(A)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe question is asking for the meaning of collective rights. To answer this, we need to understand what collective rights are and how they differ from individual rights.\n\nCollective rights are rights that belong to groups of people, rather than individual members of those groups. This means that the group as a whole has a right that is distinct from the rights of its individual members.\n\nOption (B) is the best answer because it accurately describes collective rights as those that belong to particular groups as opposed to the individual members of the group. This means that collective rights are not the same as individual rights, but rather are rights that are held by the group as a whole.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it suggests that collective rights belong to distinct groups of people, which is not necessarily the case. Collective rights can belong to any group, regardless of how distinct it may be.\n\nOption (C) is also incorrect because minority rights are not necessarily collective rights. While minority rights may be an example of collective rights, not all collective rights are necessarily minority rights.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it suggests that collective rights entail a right of the group as such as well as individual rights of the group's members. While this may be true in some cases, it is not a defining characteristic of collective rights.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Collective rights are those that belong to particular groups as opposed to the individual members of the group.\n\n(B)",

            "model_answer": "The fundamental premise of monist theory is that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).\n\nMonism is a legal philosophy that posits that there is only one source of law, and that international and domestic law are not separate legal systems. Instead, they are part of a single, unified legal order. This means that international law is not considered superior or inferior to domestic law, but rather, they are both part of the same legal framework.\n\nThis is in contrast to dualist theory, which posits that international and domestic law are separate legal systems, and that international law is only applicable in cases where domestic law is silent or incapable of addressing a particular issue.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the fundamental premise of monist theory.",

The Court recognized that societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships had changed significantly over time, and that the Convention's protections should be interpreted in light of these changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Goodwin v UK (2002).",
