After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished.

The formation of a boarding club, which was managed by the members themselves, provided a sense of community and security for the women involved. This aligns with the goal of greater rights for unions, as it emphasizes the importance of collective action and support among workers.\n\nThe other options do not align as directly with the perspective of the passage:\n\n(A) Women's suffrage: While the passage does mention the struggles of women, it does not specifically address the issue of women's suffrage.\n\n(B) Trust-busting: The passage does not mention anything about trusts or monopolies, so it does not support the goal of trust-busting.\n\n(D) Weakening political machines: The passage does not mention anything about political machines or the desire to weaken them, so it does not support this goal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Greater rights for unions.",

It also acknowledges the government's support for the railroads, which helped to spur economic growth and development.\n\nThe other answer choices do not accurately describe the effect of the rail system.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right.

If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it.
