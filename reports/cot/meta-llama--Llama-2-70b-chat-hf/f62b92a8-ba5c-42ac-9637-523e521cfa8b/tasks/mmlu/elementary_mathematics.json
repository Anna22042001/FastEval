We also know that she drove the same number of miles each day.\n3. So, to find out how many miles she drove each day, we can divide the total number of miles she drove by the number of days she drove.\n4. In this case, we can divide 40 miles by 5 days, which gives us 8 miles per day.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 8.\n\n(C) 8",

The divisor, -8, has the same sign as the dividend.\n3. When dividing two numbers with the same sign, the result will have the opposite sign.\n4. So, in this case, the quotient will be positive.\n5.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's look at the information we've been given:\n\n* The soccer team has $90.00 to buy soccer balls.\n* One soccer ball costs $15.60.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use this information to find the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy.\n\n1. First, we can calculate the cost of one soccer ball by multiplying the cost per soccer ball ($15.60) by the number of soccer balls we want to buy.\n2. Next, we can calculate the total cost of the soccer balls by adding up the cost of each soccer ball.\n3. Finally, we can compare the total cost of the soccer balls to the amount of money the team has available ($90.00) to find the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the answer choices:\n\n(A) 4\n\nThe cost of 4 soccer balls would be $4 \\* $15.60 = $62.40. This is less than the $90.00 the team has available, so 4 soccer balls is a valid answer.\n\n(B) 5\n\nThe cost of 5 soccer balls would be $5 \\* $15.60 = $78.00. This is still less than the $90.00 the team has available, so 5 soccer balls is also a valid answer.\n\n(C) 6\n\nThe cost of 6 soccer balls would be $6 \\* $15.60 = $93.60.

This is also greater than the $90.00 the team has available, so 7 soccer balls is not a valid answer.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of soccer balls the team can buy is 5.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 5.",
