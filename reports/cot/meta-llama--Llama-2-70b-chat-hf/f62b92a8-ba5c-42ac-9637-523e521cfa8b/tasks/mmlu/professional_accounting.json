            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, we need to first calculate the daily revenue and then multiply it by the number of days the car will be hired per year.\n\n1. Daily Revenue:\n\nThe car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, and the hourly rate is $245. Therefore, the daily revenue will be:\n\nDaily Revenue = 2 hours/day x $245/hour = $490/day\n\n2. Daily Costs:\n\nThe daily costs of the car are estimated to be $50 per day.\n\n3. Yearly Revenue:\n\nTo calculate the yearly revenue, we need to multiply the daily revenue by the number of days the car will be hired per year. Assuming the car will be hired every day of the year, including weekends and festivities, the yearly revenue will be:\n\nYearly Revenue = $490/day x 365 days/year = $178,350/year\n\n4. Yearly Costs:\n\nThe yearly costs of the car will be:\n\nYearly Costs = $50/day x 365 days/year = $18,250/year\n\n5. Estimated Yearly Yield:\n\nTo calculate the estimated yearly yield, we need to subtract the yearly costs from the yearly revenue:\n\nEstimated Yearly Yield = Yearly Revenue - Yearly Costs\n= $178,350/year - $18,250/year\n= $160,100/year\n\nNow, we need to convert the yearly yield into a percentage. To do this, we divide the yearly yield by the initial investment of $98,000:\n\nEstimated Yearly Yield (%) = $160,100/year \u00f7 $98,000 = 164%\n\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is 164%.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) 164%.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise on Arno's balance sheet at year end, we need to consider the impact on assets and liabilities separately.\n\nAssets:\n\n* The merchandise that was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory will be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.\n* Since the purchase of the merchandise was not recorded, the asset account \"Merchandise Inventory\" will not reflect the full amount of merchandise that the company actually has.\n* Therefore, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise will result in understated assets.\n\nLiabilities:\n\n* The company's failure to record the credit purchase of merchandise means that the accounts payable (A/P) will not include the amount owed to the supplier.\n* Since the inventory is recorded correctly, the cost of goods sold (COGS) will be accurate, and the A/P will be understated by the same amount as the inventory is overstated.\n* Therefore, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise will result in understated liabilities.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (D) Understated Understated.\n\n(D) Understated Understated",

The auditor's responsibility is to ensure that all necessary procedures are performed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n3. Regarding subsequent events, the auditor should perform procedures to ensure that any events that occurred after the year end are properly reflected in the financial statements.\n4.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo calculate the net present value (NPV) of the investment project, we need to use the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The DCF method takes into account the time value of money, which means that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future, due to the potential for earning interest or returns on investment.\n\nThe formula for calculating NPV is:\n\nNPV = CF1 / (1 + r)^1 + CF2 / (1 + r)^2 + CF3 / (1 + r)^3 + ... + CFn / (1 + r)^n\n\nWhere:\n\nNPV = net present value\nCF = cash flow\nr = discount rate\nn = number of periods\n\nIn this case, the investment project generates profits of $500 in year five and year ten. We need to calculate the NPV of these cash flows.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the present value of the cash flow in year five:\n\nPV of year five cash flow = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 = $385.42\n\nNext, let's calculate the present value of the cash flow in year ten:\n\nPV of year ten cash flow = $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10 = $287.84\n\nNow, we add up the present value of the two cash flows:\n\nNPV = PV of year five cash flow + PV of year ten cash flow = $385.42 + $287.84 = $673.26\n\nTherefore, the NPV of the investment project is $673.26.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) $385.42 (the NPV of the investment project)\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how to calculate the NPV of an investment project using the DCF method!",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The question states that Dean Co. issued premium bonds with a due date of July 1 year 12, and that Dean incorrectly used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium.\n2. The straight-line method assumes that the bond's carrying value decreases evenly over its life, whereas the effective interest method takes into account the bond's declining balance and calculates interest expense based on the Bond's carrying value at the beginning of each period.\n3. Because Dean used the straight-line method, the bond's carrying value was overstated, and the interest expense was understated.\n4. At June 30 year 12, the bond's carrying value would have been lower had the effective interest method been used, resulting in a lower retained earnings balance.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Overstated, Understated.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Overstated, Understatted.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given in the question:\n\n* Face value of the bond: $100\n* Coupon rate: 5%\n* Yield: 6%\n\nNow, we need to calculate the price of the bond. The price of a bond is determined by the present value of its future cash flows, which include the coupon payments and the return of the face value at maturity.\n\nTo calculate the price of the bond, we can use the following formula:\n\nPrice = (Coupon Payments / Yield) + (Face Value / (1 + Yield)^Maturity)\n\nwhere:\n\n* Coupon Payments = $100 x 5% = $5 per year\n* Yield = 6%\n* Maturity = 3 years\n\nNow, let's calculate the present value of the coupon payments:\n\nPresent Value of Coupon Payments = $5 / (1 + 6%)^3 = $4.29\n\nNext, let's calculate the present value of the face value:\n\nPresent Value of Face Value = $100 / (1 + 6%)^3 = $96.71\n\nNow, let's add the present value of the coupon payments and the present value of the face value to get the total price of the bond:\n\nTotal Price = $4.29 + $96.71 = $100.99\n\nSo, the answer is (B) $104.29.\n\nI hope that helps!

When a company plans to sell an asset, it is required to reclassify it as an asset held for sale. The old building is being actively marketed for sale, and the company expects to complete the sale in four months, so it makes sense to reclassify it as an asset held for sale.\n\n(B) It will be classified as a current asset.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. An asset held for sale is not considered a current asset. Current assets are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or less from the balance sheet date. Since the company expects to complete the sale of the old building in four months, it is not considered a current asset.\n\n(C) It will no longer be depreciated.\n\nThis statement is correct. When an asset is reclassified as an asset held for sale, it is no longer depreciated. This is because the asset is expected to be sold, and the company will not be able to use it for its intended purpose anymore.\n\n(D) It will be valued at historical cost.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The value of an asset held for sale is not determined by its historical cost, but by its current fair value. The company will need to estimate the fair value of the old building, taking into account factors such as market conditions, the building's age, condition, and other relevant factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) It will be valued at historical cost.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",
