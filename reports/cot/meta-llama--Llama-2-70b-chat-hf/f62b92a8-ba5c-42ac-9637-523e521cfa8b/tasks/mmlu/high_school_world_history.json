By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

This led to governments investing in the development of more powerful and mobile gunpowder weapons. In contrast, China, which was threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads, found early gunpowder weapons to be of little utility and focused instead on improving horse archer units.\n\nThis contrast in the development of gunpowder weapons and military strategies between Western Europe and China can help explain why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era. The passage suggests that the focus on gunpowder weapons and their improvement in Western Europe gave them an advantage over China and other non-Western powers, who did not prioritize these weapons as much.\n\nTherefore, option (B) is the best answer.",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

The division of Korea into two zones resulted in the creation of two separate governments, and the people of Korea did not achieve full freedom until much later.\n\n(C) The Korean economy never recovered. - This option is not accurate because while the division of Korea had significant economic consequences, the Korean economy did eventually recover and has since grown into one of the most advanced economies in Asia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",

He describes the period as a time of contrasts, with both good and bad elements present. He also mentions that some authorities were loudly proclaiming the period's significance, but the passage suggests that Dickens himself was not entirely convinced. Therefore, the best adjective to describe Dickens's view would be:\n\n(C) Cynical\n\nNow, let's look at Wordsworth's description of the period:\n\n\"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive. But to be young was very heaven.\"\n\n Wordsworth's view of the French Revolution is quite different from Dickens'. He describes the period as a time of joy and excitement, particularly for the young. The use of the word \"bliss\" and the phrase \"very heaven\" suggests a sense of optimism and enthusiasm. Therefore, the best adjective to describe Wordsworth's view would be:\n\n(A) Optimistic\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) Optimistic, encouraged\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(A)",

However, this is not supported by the passage, which instead suggests that the Europeans drained African wealth and made it impossible for the continent to develop more rapidly.\n5.
