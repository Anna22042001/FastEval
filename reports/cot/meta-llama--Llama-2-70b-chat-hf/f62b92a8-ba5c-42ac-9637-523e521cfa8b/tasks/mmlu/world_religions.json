            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe word \"murtis\" is not a commonly used term in English, so let's start by breaking it down and trying to understand its roots.\n\n\"Murtis\" seems to be a Latin word, and it's derived from the verb \"muro,\" which means \"to wall\" or \"to enclose.\"\n\nBased on this, we can infer that \"murtis\" might have something to do with enclosing or surrounding something.\n\nNow, let's look at the options given:\n\n(A) Offerings\n(B) Prayers\n(C) Apparitions\n(D) Idols\n\nBased on the meaning of \"murtis,\" let's see which option makes the most sense.\n\nOption (A) Offerings doesn't seem to be related to the idea of enclosing or surrounding.\n\nOption (B) Prayers could be related, but it's not a perfect fit. While prayers can be a way of communicating with the divine, they don't necessarily involve enclosing or surrounding anything.\n\nOption (C) Apparitions could also be related. An apparition is a way of manifesting or making something appear, and it could be argued that apparitions involve some kind of enclosure or surrounding.\n\nOption (D) Idols, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be related to the meaning of \"murtis\" at all.\n\nSo, based on our reasoning, the best answer would be:\n\n(C) Apparitions.\n\nTherefore, murtis can be translated as \"apparitions.\"",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The question states that naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with which of the following.\n2. The naturalists in question are those who focused on the study of natural phenomena, such as plants, animals, and the Earth's processes.\n3. Daoism is a philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the natural world, but it does not necessarily focus on the study of natural elements and processes.\n4. The Yin-Yang School is a philosophical tradition that emphasizes the idea that all things are interconnected and that opposites are complementary, but it does not have a specific focus on natural elements and processes.\n5. Mengzi is a Confucian philosopher who emphasized the importance of moral values and personal cultivation, but he did not have a particular focus on natural elements and processes.\n6. Humanistic Buddhism is a branch of Buddhism that emphasizes the importance of human dignity and compassion, but it does not have a specific focus on natural elements and processes.\n7. Therefore, the best answer is (A) Daoism, as it emphasizes living in harmony with the natural world, even though it does not have a specific focus on natural elements and processes.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) Daoism.",

In Sikhism, it refers to the divine word or the word of God. This seems like a strong contender for the answer.\n\n(B) Khalse - Khalse is a Punjabi word that means \"pure\". While it's true that Guru Nanak emphasized the importance of living a pure life, there's no evidence to suggest that he used this term specifically to denote the divine word.\n\n(C) Nam - Nam is a Punjabi word that means \"name\". Guru Nanak did use this term in his teachings, but it's not directly related to the concept of the divine word.\n\n(D) Guru - Guru is a Punjabi word that means \"teacher\" or \"mentor\". While Guru Nanak was certainly a spiritual teacher, this term doesn't specifically refer to the divine word.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer seems to be (A) Shabad. Guru Nanak used the term Shabad to denote the divine word as part of divine revelation.\n\nSo, the answer is: (A) Shabad.",
