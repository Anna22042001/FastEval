From the factorization, we can see that the equation has at least one solution, which is x = 1.\n3. Since x = 1 is a solution, we know that k, the number of real solutions in the interval [0, 1], is at least 1.\n4. Now, let's consider the number of real solutions not in [0, 1]. We can see that the function e^x + x - 2 is continuous and non-zero on the interval (0, 1), so by the intermediate value theorem, there must be at least one real solution not in [0, 1]. Therefore, n, the number of real solutions not in [0, 1], is at least 1.\n5. Since k is at least 1 and n is at least 1, we can conclude that k + n is at least 2.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) k = n = 1, as k and n are both at least 1, and k + n is at least 2.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) k = n = 1.",

Additionally, the property that x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G means that the group has a \"fourth power identity\" element, which is an element a such that a + a + a + a = 0.\n\nNow, let's count the number of additive abelian groups of order 16 with this property.\n\nStep 1: Consider the possible orders of the elements in G.\nSince G has 16 elements, the orders of the elements can be 1, 2, 4, or 16.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of elements of each order in G.\nIf an element has order 1, it must be the identity element 0. There can only be one identity element, so there is one element of order 1.\n\nIf an element has order 2, it must be an element a such that a + a = 0. Since we are looking for groups with the property that x + x + x + x = 0, we know that a + a + a + a = 0, which means that a + a = 0. There are 4 ways to choose such an element a (0, 1, 2, 3), so there are 4 elements of order 2.\n\nIf an element has order 4, it must be an element a such that a + a + a = 0. Since we are looking for groups with the property that x + x + x + x = 0, we know that a + a + a + a = 0, which means that a + a + a = 0. There are 4 ways to choose such an element a (0, 1, 2, 3), so there are 4 elements of order 4.\n\nIf an element has order 16, it must be an element a such that a + a + a + ... + a (16 times) = 0. Since we are looking for groups with the property that x + x + x + x = 0, we know that a + a + a + ... + a (16 times) = 0, which means that a + a + a + ... + a (16 times - 1) = 0. This implies that a + a + a + ... + a (15 times) = 0, which means that a has order 16. There is only one way to choose such an element a, so there is one element of order 16.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of groups with the given property.\nSince we have already counted the number of elements of each order, we can now calculate the number of groups with the given property as follows:\n\n* Number of groups with only one element of order 16 = 1 (since there is only one way to choose the element a)\n* Number of groups with 4 elements of order 2 = 4C1 = 4 (since there are 4 ways to choose the first element a, and once the first element is chosen, the remaining 3 elements are determined)\n* Number of groups with 4 elements of order 4 = 4C2 = 6 (since there are 4 ways to choose the first element a, and once the first element is chosen, there are 3 ways to choose the second element b, and once the second element is chosen, there are 2 ways to choose the third element c, and once the third element is chosen, there is only one way to choose the fourth element d)\n\nAdding up, we get:\n1 + 4 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 additive abelian groups of order 16 with the property that x + x + x + x = 0 for each x in G.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(C) 11",

Since the degree of the polynomials in P is less than or equal to 7, we know that the derivative of any polynomial in P will have degree at most 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible degrees of the polynomials in the null space of D:\n\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 0, then its derivative is 0, and it is in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 1, then its derivative is a constant, and it is not in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 2, then its derivative is a linear polynomial, and it is in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 3, then its derivative is a quadratic polynomial, and it is not in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 4, then its derivative is a cubic polynomial, and it is not in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 5, then its derivative is a quartic polynomial, and it is not in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 6, then its derivative is a quintic polynomial, and it is not in the null space of D.\n* If the degree of a polynomial in P is 7, then its derivative is a septic polynomial, and it is not in the null space of D.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can see that the null space of D consists of all polynomials in P with degree 0 or 2. Therefore, the dimension of the null space of D is 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the range of D, which is the set of all polynomials in Z_5[x] that can be expressed as the derivative of a polynomial in P. Since the degree of the polynomials in P is less than or equal to 7, we know that the range of D consists of all polynomials in Z_5[x] with degree at most 6.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the range of D is 7 - 1 = 6, since there are 7 polynomials in Z_5[x] with degree at most 6, and 1 of them is the zero polynomial.\n\nSo, the dimensions of the null space and range of D are:\n\nn = 2\nr = 6\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) n = 2 and r = 5.\n\n(C)",

In this case, the point is (x, y) = (8, 8), and we need to find the line that passes through this point and the origin (0, 0).\n\nTo find this line, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is y = mx + b. We know that the slope of the line passing through (8, 8) and the origin is 0 (i.e., the line is horizontal), so we can write:\n\ny = 0x + b\n\nNow, we need to find the value of b. We know that the line passes through (8, 8), so we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n8 = 0(8) + b\n\nSolving for b, we get:\n\nb = 8\n\nSo, the equation of the line passing through (8, 8) and the origin is:\n\ny = 0x + 8\n\nNow, we need to find the shortest distance from (8, 8) to the origin. We can do this by finding the point on the line where the distance to the origin is minimized. This point is clearly the origin itself, because the distance from the origin to any point on the line is always zero.\n\nTherefore, the shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin is:\n\n(D) 2sqrt(2)\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful!",

The ladder is 9 meters in length, and the bottom end is moving away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second.\n2. The top end of the ladder is sliding downward along the wall, and the distance between the top end and the ground is given as 3 meters.\n3. We can draw a right triangle with the ladder as the hypotenuse, and the distance from the top end to the ground as the opposite side. The adjacent side will be the distance from the bottom end to the top end, which is 9 - 3 = 6 meters.\n4. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse (the ladder) as sqrt(6^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(36 + 9) = sqrt(45) meters.\n5. Now, we need to find the speed at which the top end of the ladder is sliding downward. We can use the formula for velocity = distance / time, where distance is the length of the hypotenuse and time is the time it takes for the bottom end to move 2 meters.\n6. Since the bottom end is moving at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, it will take 2 seconds to move 2 meters.
