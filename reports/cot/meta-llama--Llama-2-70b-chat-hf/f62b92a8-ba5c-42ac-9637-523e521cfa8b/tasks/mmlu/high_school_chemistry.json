            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The sample has a total mass of 29.05 g, and it consists of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n2. The mass of the carbon is 18.02 g, and the mass of the hydrogen is 3.03 g.\n3. The mass of the oxygen can be calculated by subtracting the mass of the carbon and hydrogen from the total mass: 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g = 8.00 g.\n4. Since the compound consists of only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, we can use the masses of these elements to determine the empirical formula.\n5. The empirical formula is the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element present in the compound.\n6. The ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 18.02 g : 3.03 g : 8.00 g, or 6:1:2.\n7. The empirical formula is therefore C2H4O.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) C2H4O.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's start by looking at the molecular formula for propane: C3H8. This tells us that one molecule of propane contains 3 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nNext, we need to know the molar mass of propane. The molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance, and it's typically expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol). The molar mass of propane is 44.1 g/mol.\n\nNow, we're given the mass of propane in grams: 6.2 g. To find the number of moles of propane, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = mass (in grams) / molar mass\n\nPlugging in the values we get:\n\nmoles = 6.2 g / 44.1 g/mol = 0.143 mol\n\nSo, there are 0.143 moles of propane in 6.2 g of propane.\n\nNow, we need to convert this value to the nearest whole number of moles. We can do this by rounding the decimal value to the nearest whole number. In this case, 0.143 rounds to 0.14, which is equivalent to 14 moles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 7.1 mol.\n\nHere's a summary of the steps:\n\n1. Identify the molecular formula for propane: C3H8.\n2. Determine the molar mass of propane: 44.1 g/mol.\n3. Calculate the number of moles of propane using the formula: moles = mass (in grams) / molar mass.\n4. Plug in the values: moles = 6.2 g / 44.1 g/mol = 0.143 mol.\n5. Round the decimal value to the nearest whole number of moles: 0.143 rounds to 14 moles.\n6. Output the answer: (D) 7.1 mol.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo determine which of the following indicates that a reaction is spontaneous, we need to consider the definition of spontaneity in chemistry. A spontaneous reaction is one that proceeds on its own, without the need for external input or intervention. In other words, a spontaneous reaction is one that has a negative change in free energy (\u0394G\u00b0).\n\nNow, let's consider each of the options:\n\n(A) At equilibrium, there are more products than reactants.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true for a spontaneous reaction. In fact, equilibrium is a state where the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal, and the concentrations of reactants and products are constant. The ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium can vary depending on the reaction, and it's not a reliable indicator of spontaneity.\n\n(B) The value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero.\n\nThis statement is correct! The change in free energy (\u0394G\u00b0) is a measure of the energy change associated with a reaction. If \u0394G\u00b0 is positive, the reaction is non-spontaneous, meaning it requires an input of energy to proceed. If \u0394G\u00b0 is negative, the reaction is spontaneous, meaning it releases energy. So, if the value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero, the reaction is non-spontaneous.\n\n(C) The value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero.\n\nThis statement is also correct! The change in entropy (\u0394S\u00b0) is a measure of the disorder or randomness associated with a reaction. If \u0394S\u00b0 is positive, the reaction is spontaneous, meaning it increases the disorder of the system. If \u0394S\u00b0 is negative, the reaction is non-spontaneous, meaning it decreases the disorder of the system. So, if the value of \u0394S\u00b0 is greater than zero, the reaction is spontaneous.\n\n(D) The value of Keq is less than one.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Keq is the equilibrium constant, which is a measure of the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium. A value of Keq less than one indicates that the reaction favors the reactants, meaning it's non-spontaneous. A value of Keq greater than one indicates that the reaction favors the products, meaning it's spontaneous.\n\nSo, based on our analysis, the correct answer is (B) The value of \u0394G\u00b0 is greater than zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",
