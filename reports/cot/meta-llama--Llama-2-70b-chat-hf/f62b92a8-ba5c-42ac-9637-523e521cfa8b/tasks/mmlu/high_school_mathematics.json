We need to reflect this pentagon across the line y = x to get a new pentagon, P'.\n\nNow, when we reflect a shape across a line, the new shape will have the same vertices, but the coordinates of those vertices will be flipped. In other words, the x-coordinates become y-coordinates and vice versa.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying the vertices of the original pentagon P:\n\n* Vertex 1: (-2, -4)\n* Vertex 2: (-4, 1)\n* Vertex 3: (-1, 4)\n* Vertex 4: (2, 4)\n* Vertex 5: (3, 0)\n\nNow, let's reflect these vertices across the line y = x to get the vertices of the new pentagon P':\n\n* Vertex 1': (2, -4)\n* Vertex 2': (4, 1)\n* Vertex 3': (1, 4)\n* Vertex 4': (-2, 4)\n* Vertex 5': (0, 3)\n\nNow, we need to find which vertex of P' corresponds to option (A), (B), (C), or (D).\n\n(A) (0, \u2013 3)\n\nThis vertex corresponds to Vertex 5' of P', which is (0, 3).

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The length of a rectangle is twice its width, so if the width is w, the length is 2w.\n2. The diagonal of a rectangle is the square root of the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides. In this case, the diagonal is 5\u221a5, so we can set up the equation:\n\n5\u221a5 = \u221a(2w)^2 + \u221a(2w)^2\n3. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n5\u221a5 = 4w^2\n4. Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for w^2:\n\nw^2 = 5\u221a5/4\n5. Finally, we can take the square root of both sides to find w:\n\nw = \u00b1\u221a(5\u221a5/4)\n\nSince the width is a positive value, we can discard the negative square root and choose the positive one:\n\nw = \u221a(5\u221a5/4)\n\nNow that we have found the width, we can easily find the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width by the length:\n\nArea = w(2w) = 2w^2\n\nSubstituting the value of w, we get:\n\nArea = 2(\u221a(5\u221a5/4))^2\n= 2(5\u221a5/4)^2\n= 2(25/4)\n= 2(6.25)\n= 12.5\n\nSo, the area of the rectangle is 12.5.\n\nNow, let's compare the answer with the given options:\n\n(A) 2500: Much larger than 12.5.\n(B) 2: Much smaller than 12.5.\n(C) 50: Smaller than 12.5, but closer than (B).\n(D) 25: Smaller than 12.5, but closer than (C).\n\nSince none of the options match the exact value of 12.5, we cannot choose any of them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) None of the above.",
