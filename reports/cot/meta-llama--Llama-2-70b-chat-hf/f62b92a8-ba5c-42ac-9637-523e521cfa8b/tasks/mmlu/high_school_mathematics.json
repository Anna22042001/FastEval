            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the point $(x,y)$ satisfies the condition $x < y$.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\n\nThe problem states that the point $(x,y)$ is randomly picked from inside a rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$. We need to find the probability that $x < y$.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant information\n\nThe relevant information in this problem is the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle and the fact that the point $(x,y)$ is randomly picked from inside the rectangle.\n\nStep 3: Reason about the problem\n\nSince the point $(x,y)$ is randomly picked from inside the rectangle, we can assume that it is uniformly distributed within the rectangle. Therefore, the probability that $x < y$ is equal to the ratio of the area of the region where $x < y$ to the total area of the rectangle.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the probability\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $3 \\times 2 = 6$. The area of the region where $x < y$ is $2 \\times 1 = 2$. Therefore, the probability that $x < y$ is $\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\n\nThe answer is (D) $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe answer is (D) $\\frac{1}{3}$ because the probability that $x < y$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$. This is calculated by dividing the area of the region where $x < y$ by the total area of the rectangle.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's understand what the notation $\\log_3 81$ means. The $\\log$ symbol represents the logarithm function, and the subscript $3$ indicates that the logarithm is being taken base 3. In other words, we are asking for the power to which 3 must be raised to produce 81.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can solve this problem. One way to do it is to use the fact that $\\log_3 x = y$ if and only if $3^y = x$. In other words, we can find the value of $y$ such that $3^y = 81$.\n\nSo, let's try to find the value of $y$ that satisfies this equation. We can start by trying different values of $y$ and seeing if they work.\n\n* If $y = 1$, then $3^1 = 3$, which is not equal to 81.\n* If $y = 2$, then $3^2 = 9$, which is still not equal to 81.\n* If $y = 3$, then $3^3 = 27$, which is equal to 81.\n\nTherefore, we have found that $y = 3$ is the value of $y$ that satisfies the equation $3^y = 81$.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is:\n\n(D) 27\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand how to solve the problem!",

This means that if the number of bacteria doubles, the rate at which they increase also doubles.\n\nWe are given that an initial population of 200 triples in 10 hours. This means that the number of bacteria after 10 hours is 3 times the initial number, or 600.\n\nIf the pattern of increase continues unabated, we can assume that the number of bacteria will continue to triple every 10 hours.\n\nTherefore, after 1 full day (which is 24 hours), the number of bacteria will have tripled 3 times, or 9 times the initial number.\n\nSo, the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is:\n\n200 x 3^3 = 2408\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 2408.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the reasoning behind the answer!",

The formula for this theorem is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\n\nWhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the starting point and the ending point of the journey.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the ending point. The person walked 3 miles east, so the x-coordinate of the ending point is 3 miles east of the starting point. The person then turned north and walked 10 miles, so the y-coordinate of the ending point is 10 miles north of the starting point. Finally, the person turned west and walked 6 miles, so the x-coordinate of the ending point is now 6 miles west of the starting point. Lastly, the person turned south and walked 16 miles, so the y-coordinate of the ending point is now 16 miles south of the starting point.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values we know into the formula:\n\ndistance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\ndistance = sqrt((6-3)^2 + (16-10)^2)\ndistance = sqrt(9 + 64)\ndistance = sqrt(73)\ndistance \u2248 8.5\n\nSo, the approximate distance from the starting point of the person's journey is 8.5 miles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 9.2.\n\nI hope this explanation was helpful and easy to understand!",

After 6 full rotations, the figure skater would be facing south (since she started facing north and rotated clockwise).\n5.

To find the probability that $abc = 180$, we need to find the probability that the product of the three dice is equal to 180.\n5. We can calculate this by finding the number of ways in which the product of the three dice is equal to 180, and then dividing that by the total number of possible outcomes.\n6. The number of ways in which the product of the three dice is equal to 180 is 1 (1 x 2 x 3 = 180).\n7. The total number of possible outcomes is 6 x 6 x 6 = 216.\n8.
