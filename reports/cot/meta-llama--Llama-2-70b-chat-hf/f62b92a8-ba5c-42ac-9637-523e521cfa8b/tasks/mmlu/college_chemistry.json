The rate of a zero-order reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant.\n\n(D) r = k [B] - This option is incorrect because the rate of a zero-order reaction is determined by the concentration of the reactant(s), not the product(s).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) r = k [A]\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C)",

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\nF = C - P + 2\n\nIn this case, we have a three component mixture, so C = 3. The number of phases (P) is the number of independent ways in which the components can be combined to form different phases.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of phases, we need to consider the possible combinations of the three components.

It only applies when the process is reversible, meaning that it happens in a way that allows the system to return to its initial state without any change in the surroundings.

This means that the unpaired electron will experience a magnetic field that is equivalent to the magnetic field produced by two equivalent nitrogen nuclei.\n\nTherefore, the number of lines that will appear in the EPR spectrum will depend on how many different magnetic transitions are possible for the unpaired electron.\n\nFor a nitronyl nitroxide diradical, we can draw the following transitions:\n\n1.

To determine the ratio of the two concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN], we can use the intensities of the lines to compare the relative amounts of the two compounds.\n\nSince the intensities of the lines are directly proportional to the concentrations of the compounds, we can set up a ratio to compare the concentrations:\n\n[DMSO]:[AN] = \u03b1:3\u03b1\n\nNow, we are given four options for the ratio of the concentrations:\n\n(A) 1:1\n(B) 1:3\n(C) 1:6\n(D) 2:3\n\nWe can eliminate option (A) 1:1 because the relative intensities of the lines do not match.

T1 refers to the spin-lattice relaxation time, which is the time it takes for the nuclear spins to return to their equilibrium state after being excited by an external magnetic field. T2 refers to the spin-spin relaxation time, which is the time it takes for the nuclear spins to lose their phase coherence with each other after being excited by an external magnetic field.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nOption A states that T1 is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions, unlike T2. This means that T1 is affected by slow molecular movements, while T2 is not. This could be true, as T1 is known to be sensitive to molecular motions in the frequency range of 10^(-4) to 10^(-3) Hz, which is lower than the frequency range of T2. However, this statement does not explain why T1 is sometimes longer than T2.\n\nOption B states that T2 is sensitive to very low-frequency molecular motions, unlike T1. This means that T2 is affected by slow molecular movements, while T1 is not. This is not consistent with the fact that T1 is sometimes longer than T2.\n\nOption C states that T1 is sensitive to molecular motions at the Larmor frequency. The Larmor frequency is the frequency of the magnetic field used to excite the nuclear spins.
