            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of obligations in the employer-employee relationship. Obligations refer to the duties and responsibilities that individuals have towards each other in a contractual agreement. In the context of employment, workers have certain obligations towards their employer, which are typically outlined in individual contracts and wider employment laws.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (D) Employee duties.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Employee rights refer to the benefits and protections that employees are entitled to receive from their employer, such as fair compensation, safe working conditions, and equality in the workplace. While employee rights are an important aspect of the employer-employee relationship, they are not directly related to the obligations of workers towards their employer. (A)\n* Employee rights again, this time with a different description. As mentioned earlier, employee rights refer to the benefits and protections that employees are entitled to receive from their employer. (B)\n* Employer duties refer to the responsibilities and obligations that employers have towards their employees, such as providing fair compensation, maintaining safe working conditions, and complying with employment laws. While employer duties are important, they are not directly related to the obligations of workers towards their employer. (C)\n* Employee duties, on the other hand, refer to the responsibilities and obligations that workers have towards their employer, such as performing their job duties to the best of their ability, following company policies, and respecting their colleagues and supervisors. This is the correct answer. (D)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Employee duties.",

The question states that the issue is related to the intensity of work and technological shifts.\n2. The phrase \"work-related and non-work-related activities\" suggests that the issue is about the balance between work and personal life.\n3. Option (D) Work-life balance is the most appropriate term to describe this concept.\n4. Option (A) Presenteeism refers to the practice of being present at work without being productive, which is not related to the issue described in the question.\n5. Option (B) Absenteeism refers to the practice of being absent from work without authorization, which is also not related to the issue described in the question.\n6. Option (C) Work-play balance is not a commonly used term, and it does not accurately describe the issue described in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Work-life balance.",

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question can be determined by analyzing the given sentence and identifying the correct term that fits the description.\n\nThe sentence describes a system where entities (companies and industries) and their environments are interconnected and interdependent, much like natural ecosystems. It highlights the importance of considering the interdependence of various components and the value added to sustainability thinking by adopting this perspective.\n\nOption A, \"Industrial supply loops,\" does not accurately reflect the description given in the sentence. While supply loops are an essential aspect of industries, they do not capture the idea of interdependence and balance among various components.\n\nOption B, \"Industrial ecosystems,\" is a suitable term to describe the system in question. An industrial ecosystem refers to a network of interconnected companies, industries, and their environments that work together to create value and minimize waste. This term emphasizes the interdependence of various components, much like natural ecosystems.\n\nOption C, \"Ecological ecosystems,\" is not directly related to the description in the sentence. While ecological ecosystems are indeed characterized by interdependence and balance among various components, the sentence specifically focuses on industries and companies.\n\nOption D, \"Corporate ecosystems,\" is not a suitable term to describe the system in question. This term may refer to the internal workings of a single corporation or company, but it does not encompass the broader network of industries and environments described in the sentence.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Industrial ecosystems.\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems",

The first limitation or risk of business-CSO collaborations mentioned in the question is power imbalance. This refers to a situation where one party, usually the business, has more power or influence than the other party, the CSO.\n2. The second limitation or risk mentioned is unfair distribution of resources. This means that one party, again usually the business, has more access to resources such as funding, technology, or expertise, while the CSO may have limited resources.\n3. The third limitation or risk mentioned is CSOs being co-opted. This means that the business may try to use the CSO for its own benefit, without considering the CSO's own goals or interests.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted.\n\n(B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning for answering this question is as follows:\n\n1. Corporate profit maximization is a concept that is often associated with capitalism and the pursuit of financial gain.\n2. Hedonistic utilitarianism is a normative theory that suggests that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n3. Preference utilitarianism is a normative theory that suggests that actions are right if they promote the satisfaction of the preferences of the greatest number of people.\n4. The Categorical Imperative is a normative theory that suggests that actions are right if they could be universalized and become a law for everyone.\n5. Ethics of care is a normative theory that suggests that actions are right if they promote the well-being and flourishing of all individuals and relationships.\n\nBased on these descriptions, it seems that corporate profit maximization is most similar to preference utilitarianism. This is because preference utilitarianism suggests that actions are right if they promote the satisfaction of the preferences of the greatest number of people, which could potentially align with the goal of maximizing profits for a corporation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) preference utilitarianism.\n\n(B)",

Friedman does not believe that businesses have a primary responsibility to society or employees.\n5. While he acknowledges that businesses may have responsibilities to their stakeholders, he believes that these responsibilities should not come at the expense of shareholder profits.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer to the question is (A) The only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders.\n\n(A)",

The question states that the regulation goes further than the interactions that CSOs (Civil Society Organizations) have with businesses. This implies that the regulation is related to the relationship between CSOs and businesses.\n2. The word \"mechanics\" does not fit in the context of the sentence. It suggests a focus on the technical aspects of how things work, whereas the sentence seems to be more concerned with the broader aspects of the relationship between CSOs and businesses.\n3. The word \"outcomes\" fits well in the context of the sentence. It suggests that the regulation is concerned with the results or consequences of the interactions between CSOs and businesses.\n4. The word \"political\" also fits well in the context of the sentence. It suggests that the regulation is related to the way that power is exercised in the relationship between CSOs and businesses, and that it may be influenced by political considerations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes.",
