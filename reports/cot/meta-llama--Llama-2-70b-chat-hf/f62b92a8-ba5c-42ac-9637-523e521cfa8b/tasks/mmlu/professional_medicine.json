            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

She had been having regular contractions every 4\u00a0minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6\u00a0hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100%\u00a0effaced and 7\u00a0cm dilated. The most likely diagnosis is\n\n(A) Braxton Hicks contractions\n(B) lower uterine retraction ring\n(C) hypotonic uterine dysfunction\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The patient's age, gravidity, and parity are given as 25 years, 3, and 2, respectively. This means that she is a 25-year-old woman who has been pregnant three times and has given birth twice.\n2. The patient is admitted to the hospital at 39 weeks' gestation, which means she is almost full-term.\n3. The patient is in active labor, which means she is experiencing contractions that are helping to move the baby down the birth canal.\n4. However, the patient has been having only a few intermittent, weak contractions, which suggests that something might be wrong.\n5. The patient has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which suggests that she is experiencing discomfort or pain.\n6. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor, which means that there is no physical blockage preventing the baby from being born.\n7. The fetal head is engaged, which means that the baby's head is positioned downwards and is ready to come out.\n8. The membranes are intact, which means that the amniotic sac surrounding the baby is still intact.\n9. The fetal heart tones are normal, which means that the baby's heart is beating at a normal rate and rhythm.\n10. The cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, which means that the cervix is fully effaced (thinned out) and is 7 cm open. This is consistent with active labor.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is (D) primary dysfunctional labor. This is a condition where the uterus is not contracting properly, leading to weak or ineffective contractions. The patient's history of regular contractions every 4 minutes, followed by a decrease in contractions, suggests that she may have experienced a temporary decrease in uterine function. The absence of any physical blockage or other explanation for the decrease in contractions supports the diagnosis of primary dysfunctional labor.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) primary dysfunctional labor.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation\n(B) Cor pulmonale\n(C) Systemic hypertension\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nThe patient's medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic test results provide valuable information that can help us identify the most likely complication this patient is at risk for.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the patient's medical history. The patient has not had a well-child examination in 4 years, which suggests that they may not have received adequate medical care in the past. Additionally, the patient had pneumonia at age 3, which could have left them with underlying lung damage or scarring.\n\nNow, let's move on to the patient's physical examination. The patient's vital signs are normal, but the cardiac examination reveals a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, which suggests that there may be a problem with the heart's blood flow. The femoral pulses are weak, and there is a radiofemoral delay, which implies that there may be an issue with blood flow to the legs.\n\nFinally, the chest x-ray and ECG results show mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence and left ventricular hypertrophy, respectively. These findings suggest that the patient's heart is working harder than usual, which can lead to complications.\n\nBased on this information, the most likely complication this patient is at risk for is (B) Cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale is a condition where the right side of the heart becomes enlarged due to increased pressure in the lungs, which can lead to heart failure. The patient's history of pneumonia, weak femoral pulses, and radiofemoral delay suggest that they may have lung damage or scarring, which can lead to cor pulmonale.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Cor pulmonale.\n\nI hope this explanation helps!",

            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the symptoms described in the question is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The patient's symptoms of numbness in her right hand, tingling in the right ring and small fingers, and decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger are consistent with median nerve entrapment.\n2. The patient's occupation as a cashier and computer use at home may have contributed to the development of median nerve entrapment, as these activities can cause repetitive strain on the wrist and hand.\n3. The patient's history of playing softball for 5 years until 2 years ago may have also contributed to the development of median nerve entrapment, as the repeated throwing motion can put strain on the median nerve.\n4. The patient's age of 25 and lack of history of serious illness make it less likely that the symptoms are caused by a more serious condition such as a tumor or autoimmune disorder.\n5. The physical examination findings of full muscle strength and a jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers with palpation of the right elbow are consistent with median nerve entrapment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Median nerve at the wrist.",

The patient's symptoms of crying all the time, not getting out of bed, and low pain rating (1-2 on a 10-point scale) suggest that she may be experiencing depression and anxiety, which can be a common side effect of cancer treatment.\n2. The patient's history of hypertension and major depressive disorder also suggest that she may benefit from treatment for depression and anxiety.\n3. The patient's current medications, including oxycodone and fluoxetine, may not be effectively managing her pain and depression, as evidenced by her continued symptoms.\n4. Given the patient's history of cancer and liver metastasis, it is important to assess her for signs of suicidal ideation, as depression and hopelessness can increase the risk of suicide in patients with cancer.\n5. Starting dextroamphetamine therapy (option C) may not be the most appropriate next step, as it is primarily used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, and may not address the patient's underlying depression and anxiety.\n6. Increasing the patient's oxycodone dosage (option D) may not be the most appropriate next step, as it may not effectively manage her pain and may increase the risk of addiction and other side effects.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess the patient for suicidal ideation (option B) and consider therapies that can help manage her depression and anxiety, such as psychotherapy or antidepressant medications.\n\nAnswer: (B) Assess for suicidal ideation",

The enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake is consistent with a multinodular goiter. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is (C) Multinodular goiter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of our reasoning:\n\n1. The patient's symptoms of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, and frequent bowel movements are consistent with hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.\n2. The patient's weight loss of 6.8 kg (15 lbs) in 6 months also suggests hyperthyroidism, as it is a common symptom of an overactive thyroid gland.\n3.
