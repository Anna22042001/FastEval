            "model_answer": "To estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we need to consider various factors such as the number of households, the number of movies watched per household, and the frequency of movie watching.\n\nFirst, let's estimate the number of households in the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 127 million households in the United States in 2020.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the number of movies watched per household. This can vary greatly depending on individual preferences and lifestyles. However, we can assume an average of at least one movie per week, which translates to approximately 52 movies per year per household.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States. We can multiply the number of households by the number of movies watched per household:\n\n127,000,000 households x 52 movies/year/household = 6,604,000,000 movies/year\n\nFinally, we can round up the number to the nearest hundred million to get an approximate answer:\n\n6,604,000,000 movies/year \u2248 7,000,000,000 movies/year\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 20,000,000,000 movies/year.\n\n(C) 20,000,000,000",

            "question": "How much energy do Americans waste each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks?\n\n(A) 6*10^8 J\n(B) 6*10^11 J\n(C) 6*10^14 J\n(D) 6*10^17 J",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To estimate the amount of energy wasted by Americans throwing out unused ice in their drinks, we need to consider several factors.\n\n1. First, we need to determine how much ice is thrown out each year. Unfortunately, there isn't a reliable source that provides this information. However, we can make an educated estimate based on some assumptions.\n2. Let's assume that on average, each American throws out 10 ice cubes per day. This is a rough estimate, as it may vary depending on individual habits, seasonality, and geographical location.\n3. Next, we need to calculate the mass of 10 ice cubes. The mass of a single ice cube is approximately 20 grams. Therefore, the total mass of 10 ice cubes would be 200 grams.\n4. Now, we need to convert the mass of ice from grams to joules. To do this, we need to multiply the mass by the specific heat capacity of ice, which is 2.08 J/g\u00b7K. Let's assume that the average temperature of the ice is around 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), which means we can use the specific heat capacity value for ice at this temperature.\n5. After multiplying the mass of ice by the specific heat capacity, we get approximately 416 J per 10 ice cubes.\n6. Finally, we need to calculate the total energy wasted by Americans each year. To do this, we can multiply the energy per 10 ice cubes (416 J) by the number of Americans (approximately 331 million according to the U.S. Census Bureau's estimate for 2020).\n7. This gives us a total energy waste of approximately 139 terajoules (139,000,000,000,000 J) per year.\n\nNow, let's compare our estimate to the given options:\n\n(A) 6*10^8 J: This is significantly lower than our estimate, which means it's not a reasonable choice.\n\n(B) 6*10^11 J: This is closer to our estimate, but still a bit lower.\n\n(C) 6*10^14 J: This is significantly higher than our estimate, which means it's not a reasonable choice.\n\n(D) 6*10^17 J: This is way higher than our estimate and doesn't seem reasonable based on our assumptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 6*10^11 J.\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate based on several assumptions and may not reflect the actual energy waste.",
