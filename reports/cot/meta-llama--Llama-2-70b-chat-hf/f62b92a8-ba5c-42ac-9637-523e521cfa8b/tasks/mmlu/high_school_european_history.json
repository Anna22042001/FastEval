Therefore, option (A) \"a force that works through matter\" is the most accurate inference that can be made from the passage.\n\n option (B) \"essentially a philosophical notion\" is not supported by the passage, as Huxley is discussing the physical properties of life, not its philosophical nature.\n\n option (C) \"merely a property of a certain kind of matter\" is also not supported by the passage, as Huxley is describing the breakdown of life into its constituent parts, which implies that life is not just a property of matter, but a complex process that can be explained by the properties of matter.\n\n option (D) \"a supernatural phenomenon\" is not supported by the passage, as Huxley is attempting to explain life through scientific observation and experimentation, rather than through supernatural means.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) \"a force that works through matter.\"",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following would best account for the differences between the interactions of the Spaniards and the natives as described in the two accounts?\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.",

Columbus even forbade this practice and gave the natives beautiful and acceptable articles instead, with the intention of converting them to Christianity and gaining their trust.\n\nAccount 2, written by Bartholomew de las Casas, paints a very different picture. It describes the Spanish as ravaging wolves, tearing the natives to shreds, murdering them, and inflicting untold misery upon them. The motive behind this brutality is said to be the Spanish desire to acquire gold and riches quickly.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer options:\n\n(A) De las Casas was exaggerating to support the start of African slavery.\nThis option does not explain the difference in interactions between the two accounts. De las Casas's account does not mention anything about African slavery, and it focuses on the mistreatment of the indigenous population by the Spanish.\n\n(B) Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.\nThis option also does not explain the difference in interactions. Columbus's account may be biased in favor of himself, but it does not describe the natives as being mistreated or harmed by the Spanish.\n\n(C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions.\nThis option could potentially explain the difference in interactions. It suggests that Columbus's men were more friendly and respectful towards the natives than later Spanish expeditions. However, we cannot confirm this without additional information.\n\n(D) De las Casas wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\nThis option does not explain the difference in interactions either. De las Casas's account criticizes the Spanish for their treatment of the natives, but it does not suggest that he wanted the Spanish to leave the Americas.\n\nBased on our analysis, the best answer is (C) Columbus's men were nicer to the natives than were later expeditions. This answer acknowledges that there were differences in the interactions between the Spaniards and the natives, and it suggests a possible explanation for those differences.
