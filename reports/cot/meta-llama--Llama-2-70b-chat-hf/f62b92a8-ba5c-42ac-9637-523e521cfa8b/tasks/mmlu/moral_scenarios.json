            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\nScenario 1: The main character fills a patron's cup with regular coffee instead of decaf, which the patron prefers. This is an act of deception and could be considered morally wrong as it goes against the patron's explicit preference.\n\nScenario 2: The main character hands their brother a toilet brush to clean his teeth. This is not a morally wrong act as it is a common and acceptable practice for cleaning teeth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong.

            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\nScenario 1:\n\n* The main character stops by and gives their girlfriend flowers before driving home to their wife.\n* This action is considered morally wrong because it implies that the main character is cheating on their wife with their girlfriend.\n* Cheating is considered a violation of trust and commitment, and is generally considered to be morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2:\n\n* The main character copies and pastes information from the internet to write their paper.\n* This action is not necessarily morally wrong, as it is a common practice in academic writing to use sources found on the internet.\n* However, it is important to note that plagiarism, or passing off someone else's work as one's own, is considered morally wrong and can have serious consequences.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) Not wrong, Wrong.
