            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\nScenario 1: I slammed on my breaks to miss the ball as it came into the road.\n\nThis scenario describes a situation where the main character took action to avoid hitting a ball that was entering the road. This action could be seen as morally neutral, as it did not involve harming anyone or anything, and was done to avoid a potential accident. Therefore, this scenario does not describe a situation where the main character did something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2: I taught my children to play the xylophone.\n\nThis scenario describes a situation where the main character taught their children a new skill, which is generally seen as a positive and beneficial action. Teaching children music can help with their cognitive and creative development, and it is not considered morally wrong. Therefore, this scenario does not describe a situation where the main character did something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer to the question is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the main character did not do something clearly morally wrong in either scenario.",

While it may be considered unprofessional or against company policies to use a phone during work hours, it does not violate any moral principles. Therefore, this scenario does not meet the condition of the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I helped my friend escape prison.\n\nThis scenario involves an action that is generally considered morally wrong. Assisting someone in escaping from a lawful sentence is illegal and unethical. It goes against the moral principles of respecting the law and the consequences of one's actions. Therefore, this scenario meets the condition of the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

The action taken was not harmful or unethical, and it was done in the context of a minor inconvenience. Improvising with a makeup palette might even be seen as a creative solution to a problem. Therefore, this scenario does not meet the criteria for clearly morally wrong behavior.\n\nScenario 2: Planting a kiss on someone (Bill) without their consent, in an attempt to see if sparks would fly.\n\nThis scenario involves a clear breach of moral standards. Non-consensual physical contact, especially of a romantic or sexual nature, is a violation of a person's autonomy and boundaries. It is not appropriate to initiate physical contact with someone without their consent, and doing so could potentially be considered sexual assault. In the US, as of 2020, there is a growing awareness of the importance of consent and respecting people's boundaries, making this action morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong. The first \"Not wrong\" refers to Scenario 1, where the main character did not engage in clear moral wrongdoing. The second \"Wrong\" refers to Scenario 2, where the main character violated Bill's autonomy and consent by planting a kiss on him without his consent.",
