            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's consider the motion of the whiffle ball. When it's tossed straight up, it will initially have an upward velocity, which will decrease as it rises due to the force of gravity. At some point, the upward velocity will become zero, and the ball will reach its highest point. From there, the ball will begin to fall back down, with an initial downward velocity equal to the upward velocity it had at its highest point.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the statements:\n\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is false. The ball's speed is not zero at the highest point, because it still has an upward velocity at that point. Even though the ball is not moving in the upward direction at its highest point, it still has kinetic energy due to its motion, so its speed is not zero.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is true. At the highest point, the ball's velocity is zero, and it's not moving in any direction. Therefore, its acceleration is also zero, because acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and there is no change in velocity when the ball is stationary.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nThis statement is false. The time it takes for the ball to travel up to its highest point is equal to the time it takes to fall back down, assuming that the upward and downward velocities are equal. This is because the ball's motion is symmetrical around its highest point, so the time it takes to move up to that point is the same as the time it takes to move down from that point.\n\nNow that we've evaluated each statement, we can determine the correct answer. The only statement that is true is II, the ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point. Therefore, the answer is (B) II only.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) II only.",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The electric force between two charged particles is given by the equation F = k\\*q1\\*q2 / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges of the particles, and r is the distance between them.\n2. Since the particles are isolated, we can assume that the electric field around each particle is constant and equal to the total electric field at that point in space.\n3. The electric field at a point in space is defined as the force per unit charge, so the electric field at particle A is F_A / q_A, and the electric field at particle B is F_B / q_B.\n4. Since the particles are 4 m apart, the distance between them is constant, so we can use the equation above to calculate the ratio of the electric force on A to that on B.\n5. Plugging in the values given in the question, we get:\n\nF_A / q_A = (2Q) / (4 m) = 0.5 Q/m\nF_B / q_B = (Q) / (4 m) = 0.25 Q/m\n\n6. Now we can calculate the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B:\n\nRatio = F_A / F_B = (0.5 Q/m) / (0.25 Q/m) = 2\n\n7.

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to find the charge of an electron. We know that the electron has a charge of -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C, so we can use that value.\n2. Next, we need to find the mass of an electron. The mass of an electron is 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg.\n3. Now, we can use the formula for the magnetic force on a charged particle moving through a magnetic field: F = q(v x B). In this case, the charge is -1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C, the velocity is 10^7 m/s, and the magnetic field is 5 \u00d7 10^-5 T. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nF = (-1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(10^7 m/s) \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 10^-5 T)\nF = -8 \u00d7 10^-12 N\n4. Since we want the electron beam to be bent into a circle, we need to find the radius of the circle that the electrons will follow. We can use the formula for the radius of a circular path: r = F / (m \u00d7 v^2). In this case, the force is -8 \u00d7 10^-12 N, the mass is 9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg, and the velocity is 10^7 m/s. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nr = (-8 \u00d7 10^-12 N) / (9.11 \u00d7 10^-31 kg \u00d7 (10^7 m/s)^2)\nr = 1.32 \u00d7 10^-10 m\n5. Finally, we can convert the radius to the desired units. We want the radius in meters, so we can multiply by 1000:\n\nr = 1.32 \u00d7 10^-10 m \u00d7 1000\nr = 1.32 \u00d7 10^-8 m\n\nSo, the radius of the circle that the electron beam will follow is approximately 1.32 \u00d7 10^-8 m.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 1 mm.",
