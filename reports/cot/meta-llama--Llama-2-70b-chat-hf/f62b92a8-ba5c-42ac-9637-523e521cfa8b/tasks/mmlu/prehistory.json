            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The question states that Minoan culture shows little evidence of certain things, which means we need to look for the option that is least supported by evidence.\n2. Let's examine each option:\n\t* A) Trade: While the Minoans did engage in trade, there isn't much evidence of extensive trade networks or significant commerce compared to other civilizations of the time.\n\t* B) Warfare: There is evidence of Minoan fortifications and weapons, but there doesn't seem to be much evidence of large-scale warfare or a strong military culture.\n\t* C) Development of a common religion: The Minoans did have a complex religious system, but it doesn't seem to have been as uniform or widespread as other civilizations.\n\t* D) Conspicuous consumption by elites: There is evidence of wealth and luxury goods in Minoan society, but it doesn't seem to have been as extreme or widespread as in other cultures.\n3. Based on the above, the best answer is (D) Conspicuous consumption by elites, as there is little evidence of extreme wealth disparities or luxury goods in Minoan society.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst of all, let's examine each option carefully:\n\n(A) This option suggests that the pyramids were built as burial monuments for three pharaohs: Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. This is a plausible explanation, as it is known that the pyramids were used as tombs for pharaohs.\n\n(B) This option implies that the pyramids were built by slaves who were forced to work under the threat of death. This is a controversial claim, as there is no concrete evidence to support it. While it is true that the ancient Egyptians had a system of slavery, there is no reason to believe that the pyramids were built exclusively by slaves.\n\n(C) This option states that the pyramids were built during the 6th dynasty. This is incorrect, as the pyramids were built during the 4th dynasty.\n\n(D) This option suggests that all of the above options are correct. However, since option (C) is incorrect, this option cannot be correct.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question:\n\nThe question asks about the greatest Egyptian pyramids at Giza. The phrase \"greatest pyramids\" implies that we are looking for the most impressive or largest pyramids. The question also specifies that we are referring to the pyramids built at Giza.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) The greatest Egyptian pyramids at Giza were built as burial monuments for the pharaoh Khufu, Khufu's son Khafre, and Khufu's grandson Menkaure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (A)",

            "model_answer": "My reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\n1. The question is asking about the encounter between anatomically modern humans and other human species in the Middle East.\n2. Anatomically modern humans first appeared in Africa around 200,000 years ago, and later migrated to other parts of the world.\n3. Neandertals, also known as Homo neanderthalensis, were a distinct human species that inhabited Europe and parts of Asia from around 400,000 to 40,000 years ago. They are known to have co-existed with early Homo sapiens in certain parts of Europe and Asia.\n4. Homo erectus, on the other hand, was a human species that lived from around 1.8 million to 143,000 years ago. They were also found in Europe and parts of Asia, and there is evidence that they co-existed with Neandertals.\n5. Based on the information above, it is likely that when anatomically modern humans first arrived in the Middle East, they would have encountered Neandertals or Homo erectus, as both species were present in the region at the time.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is (A) Neandertals, the evolutionary descendants of the premodern human inhabitants of Europe and Asia.\n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's think about what we know about the palace at Knossos. It was a palace built by the Minoans, an ancient civilization that flourished on the Greek island of Crete. The palace was built around 1500 BC and was the largest palace in Minoan civilization.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\n(A) 100 rooms: This seems like a very low estimate, considering the size and importance of the palace. It's unlikely that a palace of this significance would have had only 100 rooms.\n\n(B) 500 rooms: This is a more reasonable estimate, but still quite low considering the size of the palace. While it's possible that the palace had around 500 rooms, it's not the most likely option.\n\n(C) 1,000 rooms: This is a more plausible estimate, given the size and complexity of the palace. It's possible that the palace had around 1,000 rooms, given its importance and the number of people who likely lived and worked there.\n\n(D) 5,000 rooms: This is an extremely high estimate and is unlikely to be accurate. While the palace was certainly large, it's unlikely that it had 5,000 rooms.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most likely answer is:\n\n(C) 1,000 rooms.\n\nSo, the answer is (C).",

The question states that modern human babies are secondarily altricial, which means they are helpless at birth and require extensive care from their mothers.\n2. The question suggests that this helplessness may have been an evolutionary solution to a problem.\n3. Option (A) is incorrect because it suggests that the brain size of hominids had not grown for over a million years, which is not relevant to the issue of babies' helplessness.\n4. Option (B) is incorrect because it suggests that bipedalism allowed for independence from the mother at an earlier age, but the question states that the babies are helpless at birth, so this option does not address the issue.\n5. Option (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the brain grows to nearly adult size prior to birth, which is not supported by scientific evidence.\n6. Option (C) is the correct answer because it suggests that the narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis, resulting from bipedalism, allowed for subsequent growth of the brain. This means that the brain can continue to grow and develop after birth, which is consistent with the idea of secondary altriciality.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",
