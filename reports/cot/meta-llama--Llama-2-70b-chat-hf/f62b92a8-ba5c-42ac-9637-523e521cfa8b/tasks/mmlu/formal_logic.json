            "model_answer": "The conclusion of the argument is (D) It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.\n\nThe argument starts by stating that it is hard to verify the same weakened intelligence in peers as observed in everyday patients. This implies that people's intelligence can be weakened by emotions.\n\nThe second premise states that the arrogance of consciousness, which is a defense mechanism, blocks the unconscious complexes. This means that people's consciousness can hide their unconscious thoughts and feelings, making it difficult to identify and address them.\n\nThe third premise states that due to this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn, to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This means that since people's consciousness is blocking their unconscious thoughts and feelings, it is challenging to make them aware of these unconscious processes, and thereby, difficult to teach them something that contradicts their conscious knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them something that contradicts their conscious knowledge. The answer is (D).",

Now, let's look at the four options:\n\n(A) Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.\n\nThis option doesn't quite match the given proposition. The proposition says that there exists an object x that is both an apartment and large, but this option only mentions large houses and doesn't mention apartments.\n\n(B) Some houses are bigger than all large apartments.\n\nThis option is too strong. The proposition only says that there exists an object y that is a house and bigger than x, but this option says that all large apartments are smaller than some houses.\n\n(C) Some large apartments are bigger than some houses.\n\nThis option is a good match! It says that some large apartments are bigger than some houses, which is consistent with the given proposition.\n\n(D) Some houses are bigger than some large apartments.\n\nThis option is similar to (C), but it's not as specific. It says that some houses are bigger than some large apartments, but it doesn't mention that the apartments are large.\n\n3.

The conclusion, ~G \u2283 H, is true when G is false and H is true. This is reflected in the second row of the truth table.\n\nNow, let's determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.
