Yeah, no one is rewatching it.\"\n\nThis statement appears to be sarcastic because it is contradicting itself. The first part of the statement suggests that the film had the lowest gross sales, which would imply that it was not very popular or successful. However, the second part of the statement suggests that the film was so popular that everyone is rewatching it. This contradiction is a common indicator of sarcasm.\n\nStatement B: \"It only received the highest gross sales for any recent action film. Yeah, no one is rewatching it.\"\n\nThis statement also appears to be sarcastic, but for a different reason. The first part of the statement suggests that the film had the highest gross sales, which would imply that it was very popular and successful. However, the second part of the statement suggests that the film was so unpopular that no one is rewatching it. This contradiction is also a common indicator of sarcasm.\n\nBased on the analysis of the tone and intent of both statements, it is likely that both statements are sarcastic. However, Statement A appears to be more sarcastic than Statement B, as it contains a more extreme contradiction.",

The use of the exclamation mark and the phrase \"crazy\" suggest that the speaker is being sarcastic.\n\nOption (B) - \"Wow thats crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used plastic containers before!\" - This statement is also likely to be sarcastic, as it is very common for takeout meals to be served in plastic containers.

However, the use of sarcasm suggests that the speaker is actually mocking the person's situation and implying that it is their own fault for being poor. The statement is meant to be hurtful and dismissive, rather than helpful.\n\nStatement B: \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier.\"\n\nThis statement also appears to be offering advice, but the use of sarcasm is less clear. The statement could be interpreted as either genuine advice or as a sarcastic comment. However, the use of the word \"easier\" suggests that the speaker is implying that it is simple to change one's behavior, which could be seen as dismissive or insensitive.\n\nBased on the analysis of the tone and intent of each statement, it is clear that Statement A is the sarcastic one. The speaker is using sarcasm to mock and belittle the person's situation, rather than offering genuine advice or support.",
