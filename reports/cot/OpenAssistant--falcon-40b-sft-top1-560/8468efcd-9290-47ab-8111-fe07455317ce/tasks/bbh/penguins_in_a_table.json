We can use a dictionary to store the penguins and a list to store the giraffes.\n\nHere is some Python code that does this:\n\n```python\npenguins = [\n    [\"name\", \"age\", \"height(cm)\", \"weight(kg)\"],\n    [\"Louis\", 7, 50, 11],\n    [\"Bernard\", 5, 80, 13],\n    [\"Vincent\", 9, 60, 11],\n    [\"Gwen\", 8, 70, 15]\n]\n\ngiraffes = [\n    [\"name\", \"age\", \"height(cm)\", \"weight(kg)\"],\n    [\"Jody\", 5, 430, 620],\n    [\"Gladys\", 10, 420, 590],\n    [\"Marian\", 2, 310, 410],\n    [\"Donna\", 9, 440, 650]\n]\n```\n\nNow that we have the data in a usable format, we can start answering the question. The first step is to determine how many penguins are in the list. We can do this by using the len() function:\n\n```python\nnum_penguins = len(penguins)\n```\n\nNext, we need to filter the penguins to only include those that are more than 5 years old. We can do this using a list comprehension and the age column:\n\n```python\npenguins_over_5 = [penguin for penguin in penguins if penguin[2] >= 5]\n```\n\nNow that we have a list of the penguins that are over 5 years old, we can count how many there are. We can do this using the built-in function len() again:\n\n```python\nnum_penguins_over_5 = len(penguins_over_5)\n```\n\nFinally, we can output the answer by printing it to the console:\n\n```python\nprint(num_penguins_over_5)\n```\n\nSo the answer to the question is \"3\", which corresponds to option (C).",
