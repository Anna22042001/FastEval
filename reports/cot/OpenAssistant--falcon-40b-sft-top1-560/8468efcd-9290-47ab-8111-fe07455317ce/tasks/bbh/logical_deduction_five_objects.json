Since both birds are on the same branch, we can assume that they are next to each other.\n\nStatement 3: The cardinal is the third from the left.\n\nThis statement tells us that the cardinal is the third bird from the left. Since there are five birds total, we can determine that the cardinal is the third bird on the branch, counting from the left.\n\nStatement 4: The quail is the second from the left.\n\nThis statement tells us that the quail is the second bird from the left. Since there are five birds total, we can determine that the quail is the second bird on the branch, counting from the left.\n\nStatement 5: The blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.\n\nThis statement tells us that the blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.

Since the quail is to the left of the blue jay, option B cannot be correct.\n\nOption C: The hawk is the rightmost bird, and the quail is to the left of the blue jay. Therefore, the hawk is the fourth bird from the left, and the quail is the first bird from the left. Since the quail is to the left of the blue jay, option C cannot be correct.\n\nOption D: The hummingbird is the rightmost bird, and the quail is to the left of the blue jay.
