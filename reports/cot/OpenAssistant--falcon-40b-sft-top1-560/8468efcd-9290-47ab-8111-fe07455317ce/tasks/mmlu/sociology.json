            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the context of the study by Brown and Harris (1978) on depression. The study focused on the relationship between social support, stress, and depression, and found that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. This means that women who had higher levels of social support were less susceptible to stress and, therefore, less likely to develop depression.\n\nOption (A) aligns with the findings of the study, as it states that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support. Option (B) does not align with the study's findings, as it states that self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent, which is not consistent with the study's findings that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support. Option (C) also does not align with the study's findings, as it states that men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression, which is not consistent with the study's finding that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support. Option (D) also does not align with the study's findings, as it states that men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles, which is not consistent with the study's finding that women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what a \"new form of community\" is. A community can be defined as a group of people who share a common interest, identity, or location.\n\nBased on this definition, we can eliminate (C) as a new form of community, as it is not based on a shared identity or location, but rather on a shared experience with a specific individual.\n\nNext, we can consider (A) and (B). Both of these are based on a shared identity and experience, and could be considered new forms of community. However, ethnic communities have existed for a long time, while gay villages are a relatively recent phenomenon. Therefore, we can eliminate (A) as a new form of community.\n\nThis leaves us with (B) and (D) as potential answers. Virtual communities exist only in cyberspace, and are a relatively new phenomenon. They are based on a shared interest or identity, and can be considered a new form of community.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).",

If drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a specific subculture, it suggests that more people from different backgrounds are using drugs.\n\nStatement (B): The most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy.\nThis statement does not directly support or refute the claim. It provides information about the most commonly used recreational drug, but it does not tell us anything about the overall prevalence or demographics of drug use.\n\nStatement (C): Teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys.\nThis statement does not directly support or refute the claim. It provides information about the gender breakdown of drug experimentation, but it does not tell us anything about the overall prevalence or demographics of drug use.\n\nStatement (D): Despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare.\nThis statement refutes the claim that drug use in Britain has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture. If the use of illegal drugs is very rare, it suggests that drug use is not as widespread as the claim suggests.\n\nBased on the analysis of the statements, we can conclude that statement (A) supports the claim, statement (B) does not support or refute the claim, statement (C) does not support or refute the claim, and statement (D) refutes the claim.

This definition highlights the subjective aspect of class, which refers to the way individuals perceive and experience their social position in relation to others.\n\nWeber's concept of class is not limited to economic factors, such as income or wealth, but also includes other social factors, such as education, occupation, and social status. Class situations are shaped by the social and cultural context in which they occur, and they can vary across time and space.\n\nIn conclusion, Weber's concept of class situation refers to the subjective experience of one's social position in relation to others, based on a range of social and cultural factors, rather than simply economic factors.",

This can involve lying about one's identity, background, or intentions. While there may be some benefits to this approach, such as gaining access to information that might not be available otherwise, it raises ethical concerns.\n\nOne of the main concerns with covert participant observation is the deception involved. By lying to the respondents about the reason for their presence, the researcher is violating the principle of informed consent. Informed consent requires that participants understand the purpose of the research and give their consent freely and willingly. When researchers lie to participants, they are not giving them the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether to participate.\n\nAdditionally, lying to participants can create a sense of distrust and betrayal if they discover the truth. This can have a negative impact on the researcher-participant relationship and can compromise the integrity of the research.\n\nWhile there may be situations where covert participant observation is necessary, researchers should carefully consider the ethical implications and weigh them against the potential benefits of the approach.",

It involves studying society from the perspective of women, rather than assuming a male-centered or neutral perspective. This approach recognizes that women's experiences and perspectives are often marginalized or ignored in traditional research and theory, and aims to address this imbalance by giving voice to women's experiences and knowledge.\n\nThe feminist standpoint does not necessarily suggest taking a stand on the issues neglected by feminism, although it may lead to a greater awareness of these issues. It also does not necessarily suggest a tendency to ignore the gendered nature of knowledge, although it may lead to a greater understanding of how gender shapes our understanding of the world.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",
