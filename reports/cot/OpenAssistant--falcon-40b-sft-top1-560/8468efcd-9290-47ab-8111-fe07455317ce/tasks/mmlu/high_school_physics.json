            "model_answer": "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. A whiffle ball is tossed straight up, reaches a highest point, and falls back down. Air resistance is not negligible.\n\nThis means that the ball will experience a downward force due to gravity, as well as an upward force due to the air resistance.\n\n2. Which of the following statements are true?\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is false, as the ball will have a non-zero speed at its highest point.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nThis statement is also false, as the ball will have a non-zero acceleration at its highest point.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nThis statement could be true or false, depending on the specific conditions. If the air resistance is strong enough, it is possible that the ball will take a longer time to travel up than to fall back down. However, if the air resistance is not very strong, the ball may take a shorter time to travel up than to fall back down.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) I & III only.",
