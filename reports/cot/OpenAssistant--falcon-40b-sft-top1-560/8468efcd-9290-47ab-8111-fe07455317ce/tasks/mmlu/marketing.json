The individual may be moved emotionally or aesthetically but does not actively engage with the event or environment and leaves without affecting or altering its nature.\n\nEscapism refers to the realm of passive appreciation where an individual seeks relief or distraction from an event or environment.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The importance and significance of customer experience to both individuals and society is referred to as the \"Experience Economy.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe term \"Experience Economy\" was coined by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore in their 1999 book of the same name. The concept of the Experience Economy builds on the earlier work of Pine and Gilmore's 1994 book, \"The Age of the Customer,\" which introduced the idea of the shift from a goods-based economy to a service-based economy.\n\nThe Experience Economy focuses on the idea that businesses must create memorable and engaging experiences for customers in order to differentiate themselves from competitors and build brand loyalty. In this economy, businesses sell not just products or services, but experiences that create lasting memories and emotional connections with customers.\n\nThe concept of the Experience Economy is important and significant to both individuals and society because it recognizes the value of customer experience in today's marketplace. In a world where goods and services are increasingly commoditized, businesses must find new ways to engage and connect with customers. By creating unique and memorable experiences, businesses can not only increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, but also drive long-term growth and success.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Experience economy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Penetration pricing.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPenetration pricing is a strategy where the price is set low relative to the competition to gain market share. The idea is to attract a large number of customers by offering a lower price than competitors, and then increase the price once the product or service has established a strong presence in the market.\n\nThis strategy is often used when a new product or service is introduced to the market, or when a company is trying to gain market share in a highly competitive industry. The goal is to quickly build a large customer base, and then increase prices once the product or service has become established and customers are less likely to switch to competitors.\n\nEconomy pricing is a pricing strategy where the price is set at a low level to appeal to price-sensitive customers. This strategy is often used by low-cost retailers, such as discount stores, and is aimed at attracting customers who are looking for the lowest possible price.\n\nPremium pricing is a pricing strategy where the price is set at a high level to reflect the perceived value of the product or service. This strategy is often used by luxury brands, and is aimed at customers who are willing to pay a higher price for a product or service that they perceive to be of higher quality or status.\n\nPrice skimming is a pricing strategy where the price is set high when a product or service is first introduced to the market, and then gradually lowered over time as competition increases and the product or service becomes more established. This strategy is often used by companies that have a product or service with unique features or benefits, and is aimed at maximizing profits in the early stages of the product or service's life cycle.",
