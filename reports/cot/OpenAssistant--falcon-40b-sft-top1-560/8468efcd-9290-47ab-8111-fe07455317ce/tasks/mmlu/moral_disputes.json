            "question": " What two problems does individualism lead us into, according to Hourdequin?\n\n(A) It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n(B) They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.\n(C) It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods.\n(D) We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in \"tragedy of the commons\" situations.",

            "model_answer": "Hourdequin argues that individualism leads to two main problems: the failure of developing integration and integrality, and an atomistic view of persons.\n\nIntegration refers to the idea that individuals are interconnected and interdependent, and that their well-being is tied to the well-being of others and the environment. Integrality refers to the idea that individuals are not just a collection of separate parts, but are instead whole and complete beings with a unique set of values, beliefs, and experiences.\n\nIndividualism, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of the individual over the collective. It encourages people to prioritize their own needs and desires over those of others, and to view themselves as separate and independent from the world around them.\n\nAccording to Hourdequin, this leads to an atomistic view of persons, where individuals are seen as isolated and disconnected from one another. This in turn can lead to a failure to develop integration and integrality, which can have negative consequences for both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nFor example, individualism can lead to \"tragedy of the commons\" situations, where individuals act in their own self-interest without considering the impact on the larger community or environment. It can also instill in us a sense that our moral obligations are only personal obligations, and that we can only advocate for policy changes in \"tragedy of the commons\" situations through individual action.\n\nIn summary, Hourdequin argues that individualism leads to two main problems: the failure of developing integration and integrality, and an atomistic view of persons. By recognizing these problems, we can work towards creating a more interconnected and interdependent society that values the well-being of all individuals and the environment.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) both A and B.\n\nPhilippa Foot explains the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction by appealing to both rights of noninterference and rights to goods and services.\n\nIn her article \"The Moral Status of Abortion,\" Foot argues that the distinction between killing and letting die is morally significant because it reflects the difference between actively interfering with someone's life and failing to provide them with goods or services that they need to survive. According to Foot, both types of actions can violate a person's rights, but they do so in different ways.\n\nKilling, she argues, violates a person's right to noninterference. When we kill someone, we actively bring about their death, which infringes on their right to continue living their life. On the other hand, letting someone die involves a failure to provide them with goods or services that they need to survive. This can also violate their rights, but in a different way. Foot argues that we have a duty to provide basic goods and services to those who need them, and when we fail to do so, we violate their right to those goods and services.\n\nIn conclusion, Foot's explanation of the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction involves both rights of noninterference and rights to goods and services.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand Kant's view of sexual objectification and Papadaki's argument against it.\n\nKant believed that sexual objectification involves treating a person as a mere means to one's sexual pleasure, rather than as an end in themselves with inherent dignity and worth. He thought that this was wrong because it violates the principle of humanity, which holds that people should never be used simply as a means to an end, but always as ends in themselves.\n\nPapadaki, on the other hand, argues that Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity. She thinks that it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity, and that sexual objectification actually enhances humanity.\n\nBased on this, we can eliminate answer (A) because it agrees with Kant's view. We can also eliminate answer (B) because it suggests that Papadaki agrees with Kant's view of sexual objectification.\n\nThat leaves us with answer (C) and (D). To choose between these, we need to consider Papadaki's argument that sexual objectification enhances humanity.\n\nIf we accept Papadaki's argument, then we would choose answer (C). However, it is not clear that her argument is sound, so we cannot be certain that sexual objectification actually enhances humanity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D), which states that Papadaki actually disagrees with Kant's view of sexual objectification.",

This view is consistent with the ethics of prima facie duty, which holds that certain moral duties are binding on us regardless of their consequences.\n\nKantian ethics focuses on the idea of a categorical imperative, which is a moral rule that applies universally. While Kantian ethics may also oppose genetic engineering, it is not specifically focused on the importance of certain moral qualities.\n\nVirtue ethics emphasizes the development of moral character rather than the adherence to specific rules or principles. While it may also value certain moral qualities, it is not focused on the idea that they are binding duties.\n\nNatural law theory is a philosophical approach that holds that certain moral principles are inherent in nature and can be discovered through reason.

This loss of experiences is a harm to the victim, and killing is wrong because it causes this harm.\n\nApplying this theory to abortion, we can see that if a fetus is a person with a future of experiences, then abortion would cause the loss of those experiences and would be wrong.
