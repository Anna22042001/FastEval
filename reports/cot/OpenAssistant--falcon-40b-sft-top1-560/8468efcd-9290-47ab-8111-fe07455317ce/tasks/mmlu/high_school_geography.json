            "question": "Which of the following is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry?\n\n(A) United States\n(B) Japan\n(C) France\n(D) United Kingdom",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given countries is least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Availability of natural resources within the country.\n2. Dependency on imports of natural resources from other countries.\n3. Alternative sources of natural resources, such as recycling and renewable energy.\n\nBased on these factors, we can eliminate some of the options:\n\n(A) United States: The United States has a wide range of natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and various minerals. Although it imports some natural resources, it is relatively self-sufficient in terms of meeting its industrial needs.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan has limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports of raw materials, such as oil, coal, and metals. However, it has developed a highly efficient recycling system and has invested in renewable energy sources, which has helped to reduce its dependency on imports.\n\n(C) France: France has some natural resources, such as coal and uranium, but it also relies heavily on imports of oil and other raw materials. It has made efforts to diversify its energy sources and reduce its dependency on imports, but it is still not self-sufficient in terms of meeting its industrial needs.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports of oil, gas, and metals. It has also made efforts to diversify its energy sources and reduce its dependency on imports, but it is still not self-sufficient in terms of meeting its industrial needs.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is (D) United Kingdom.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the different types of diffusion processes that can occur when a new fashion design is introduced globally.\n\nContagious diffusion is a process where the information spreads rapidly and randomly through a population. This type of diffusion is often associated with viral marketing campaigns or social media trends. However, the information spread in this process is not targeted to specific groups or regions, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.\n\nRelocation diffusion is a process where individuals or groups move from one location to another and bring the new information with them. This type of diffusion can occur when a new fashion design is introduced in a specific region and then spreads to other regions as people travel or relocate. However, this process is not focused on the global spread of information, so it is also not the correct answer.\n\nInnovative diffusion is a process where the new information spreads through a population based on the innovation-decision process. This process involves five stages: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. The new fashion design would need to go through these stages in each region where it is introduced, making this a possible answer.\n\nHierarchical diffusion is a process where the new information spreads through a population based on the influence of social hierarchy. This process involves four stages: awareness, interest, evaluation, and adoption. The new fashion design would need to go through these stages in each region where it is introduced, making this a possible answer.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is (C) innovative diffusion. This process involves a more structured approach to the spread of information, which is more likely to occur on a global scale when introducing a new fashion design.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A).\n\nExplanation:\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation states that economic development is a self-reinforcing process where initial differences in wealth and resources lead to further disparities. The theory is based on the idea that economic growth and prosperity in the core regions of the world are dependent on the exploitation of the periphery.\n\nStatement (B) is consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it suggests that the core and periphery are locked in a hierarchical relationship where the core will always dominate the periphery.\n\nStatement (C) is also consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it highlights the exploitative nature of the relationship between the core and periphery. The core benefits from the extraction of resources and cheap labor from the periphery, while the periphery remains trapped in a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.\n\nStatement (D) is not consistent with Myrdal's theory, as it suggests that regions with initial advantages can maintain and expand them through their own efforts. Myrdal's theory emphasizes the role of external factors, such as colonialism and international trade, in shaping the development trajectories of regions.",

They are characterized by their high levels of international connectivity, financial and economic power, and cultural influence. Some of the key characteristics of world cities include:\n\n1. Global financial and economic centers: World cities are major hubs for international finance, commerce, and trade. They are home to the headquarters of many multinational corporations and financial institutions.\n\n2. Multicultural and diverse populations: World cities are home to people from different cultures, ethnicities, and backgrounds.

High levels of connectivity: World cities are well-connected to other major cities around the world, both physically through transportation networks and virtually through information and communication technologies.\n\n4. Centers of innovation and knowledge production: World cities are hubs for research, development, and innovation. They attract top talent and resources from around the world, leading to the creation of new knowledge and technologies.\n\nBased on the given characteristics, we can eliminate (D) as world cities are found in both the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\nNow let's consider the remaining characteristics:\n\n(A) World cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations.\n(B) World cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities.\n(C) World cities contain many offices of multinational organizations.\n\nCharacteristic (A) is true as world cities are major hubs for international finance and commerce, and are home to the headquarters of many multinational corporations.\n\nCharacteristic (B) is also true as world cities are well-connected to other major cities around the world, both physically through transportation networks and virtually through information and communication technologies.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate (C) as it is not a characteristic associated with world cities.\n\nThe correct answer is (C).",
