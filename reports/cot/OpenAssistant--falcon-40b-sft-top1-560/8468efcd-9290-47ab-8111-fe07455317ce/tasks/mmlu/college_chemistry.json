            "model_answer": "Let's break this down into smaller questions:\n\n1. Can square planar complexes display optical isomerism?\n2. Can tetrahedral complexes display optical isomerism?\n3. Can linear complexes display optical isomerism?\n4. Can octahedral complexes display optical isomerism?\n5. What conditions are necessary for an octahedral complex to display optical isomerism?\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to know what optical isomerism is and how it arises in coordination complexes.\n\nOptical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, is the phenomenon where two molecules have the same chemical formula and connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement. These molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other and are said to be enantiomers.\n\nIn coordination complexes, optical isomerism can arise due to the presence of chiral ligands or due to the coordination geometry of the complex. Chiral ligands are ligands that have a non-superimposable mirror image, and they can induce enantiomerism in the complex.\n\nNow, let's go back to our questions:\n\n1. Can square planar complexes display optical isomerism?\nSquare planar complexes have a coordination number of four and a geometry that resembles a square planar. They can display optical isomerism if all four ligands are chiral or if the complex has at least one chiral ligand and one achiral ligand. In this case, the achiral ligand will be present in a different orientation in the enantiomers, leading to optical isomerism.\n\n2. Can tetrahedral complexes display optical isomerism?\nTetrahedral complexes have a coordination number of four and a geometry that resembles a tetrahedron. They can display optical isomerism if at least one of the ligands is chiral. In this case, the chiral ligand will induce enantiomerism in the complex.\n\n3. Can linear complexes display optical isomerism?\nLinear complexes have a coordination number of two and a linear geometry. They can display optical isomerism if both ligands are chiral. In this case, the complex will have two enantiomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.\n\n4. Can octahedral complexes display optical isomerism?\nOctahedral complexes have a coordination number of six and a geometry that resembles an octahedron. They can display optical isomerism if at least three of the ligands are different and if at least one of the ligands is chiral. In this case, the chiral ligand will induce enantiomerism in the complex.\n\n5. What conditions are necessary for an octahedral complex to display optical isomerism?\nFor an octahedral complex to display optical isomerism, at least three of the ligands must be different and at least one of the ligands must be chiral. Additionally, the complex must have a center of inversion, which means that there must be a plane that can pass through the center of the complex and divide it into two mirror image halves. If these conditions are met, the complex will have two enantiomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.",

This suggests that SOCl2 has a tetrahedral molecular geometry.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the molecular polarity of SOCl2. Sulfur is more electronegative than chlorine, which means that the shared electron pair will be pulled towards sulfur, resulting in a partial negative charge on the chlorine atoms and a partial positive charge on the sulfur atom. This creates a dipole moment within the molecule, with the positive end of the dipole directed towards the negative chlorine atoms and the negative end directed towards the positive sulfur atom.\n\nBased on these factors, we can conclude that SOCl2 has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry. The sulfur atom is at the apex of the pyramid, with one chlorine atom at each of the three equatorial positions and the fourth chlorine atom at an axial position above the plane of the molecule.
