            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand how the number of human protein-coding genes is estimated.\n\nThe human genome was first sequenced in 2003, and it was initially estimated that there were around 30,000 protein-coding genes. However, this estimate was based on computational predictions and did not take into account the complexity of gene regulation and alternative splicing.\n\nOver the years, with advancements in technology and research, the number of human protein-coding genes has been revised several times. In 2012, the ENCODE project, which aimed to identify all functional elements in the human genome, estimated that there were around 20,000 protein-coding genes.\n\nMore recently, in 2019, a study published in Nature used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to estimate the number of human protein-coding genes. The study found that there were likely to be between 19,000 and 20,000 protein-coding genes.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this estimate is likely to change over time as our understanding of the human genome continues to improve. As new technologies and research methods are developed, it is possible that we will discover more genes or that the number of genes will be revised downwards.\n\nBased on the information provided, the answer to the question is (B) 19,000\u201320,000.",

            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:\n\n(A) a deletion.\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides (DNA building blocks) in exon 10, which results in the loss of the phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508del). This mutation leads to the production of a defective CFTR protein that is unable to function properly, resulting in the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) a deletion.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of heritability and how it relates to genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\n\nHeritability is a measure of how much variation in a trait is due to genetic factors. It is calculated as the proportion of variance in a trait that is attributable to genetic differences among individuals. In other words, it tells us how much of the variation in a trait can be explained by genetic factors.\n\nIn the case of body mass index (BMI), twin and family studies have shown that heritability is greater than 50%, meaning that more than half of the variation in BMI is due to genetic factors.\n\nGWAS are a type of study that looks for associations between genetic variants (such as SNPs) and traits. The goal of a GWAS is to identify genetic variants that are associated with a particular trait, such as BMI.\n\nHowever, despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies, GWAS have only been able to explain a small proportion of the variation in BMI. In fact, the most recent estimates suggest that known SNPs only explain around 13% of the variation in BMI.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) only 13%.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the genetics of phenylketonuria (PKU) and the risk of having a child with the condition if the mother has it.\n\nPKU is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that a child must inherit two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent, to develop the condition. If only one copy of the defective gene is inherited, the individual is a carrier but does not have the disease.\n\nThe risk of having a child with PKU depends on whether both parents are carriers or if only one parent is a carrier. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit two copies of the defective gene and develop PKU. If only one parent is a carrier, there is a 50% chance that their child will inherit the defective gene and be a carrier like the parent.\n\nBased on this information, the answer is (C) 25%. This means that if the mother has untreated PKU, there is a 25% chance that her child will inherit two copies of the defective gene and develop the condition. It is important to note that this risk can be reduced to less than 1% if the mother follows a strict low-phenylalanine diet during pregnancy and the child receives early treatment after birth.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the pathogenesis of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).\n\nFH is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood, leading to an increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. It is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR).\n\nThe LDLR is a cell surface receptor that plays a key role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis. It binds to LDL particles in the bloodstream and mediates their uptake by cells, primarily in the liver. This process removes excess LDL cholesterol from the circulation and helps maintain normal cholesterol levels.\n\nIn individuals with FH, the LDLR is either defective or absent, resulting in impaired clearance of LDL cholesterol from the blood. As a result, LDL cholesterol levels remain high, leading to the development of atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) HMG-CoA reductase.",

QTL stands for \"quantitative trait locus,\" which refers to a region of the genome that contains genes that influence a complex trait, such as height, weight, or disease susceptibility. QTL analysis involves comparing the genotypes of individuals in a genetic cross who exhibit different levels of a complex trait to identify regions of the genome that are associated with that trait. This can help researchers identify the genes and genetic variants that contribute to the trait, which can provide insights into its biological mechanisms and potential treatments.\n\nB and C are incorrect because QTL analysis is specifically used to identify regions of the genome that are associated with complex traits, not to map genes in bacteria or to identify RNA polymerase binding sites.\n\nD is incorrect because QTL analysis is used to identify regions of the genome that are associated with complex traits, not to determine which genes are expressed at a particular developmental stage.",

The most common form of \u03b1-thalassaemia is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which results in reduced or absent production of the \u03b1-globin chain of haemoglobin.\n\nThere are several different types of mutations that can cause \u03b1-thalassaemia, but the most common mutation is a deletion of part of the HBB gene. This deletion results in the production of an abnormally short \u03b1-globin chain, or no \u03b1-globin chain at all. This leads to a reduction in the amount of haemoglobin produced, which can cause anaemia and other health problems.\n\nOther less common mutations that can cause \u03b1-thalassaemia include duplications of part of the HBB gene, insertions of extra genetic material into the HBB gene, and point mutations that change the structure of the \u03b1-globin chain.
