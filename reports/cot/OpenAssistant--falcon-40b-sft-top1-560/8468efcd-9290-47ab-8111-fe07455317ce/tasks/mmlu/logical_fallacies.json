This fallacy is often used by individuals who lack the ability to engage in a rational debate or who are trying to manipulate others into doing what they want.\n\nThe fallacy of appeal to force is distinct from the use of force itself, which may be justified in certain circumstances.

A conditional syllogism is a type of syllogism in which the conclusion is based on two premises: the major premise, which states a condition or a cause-and-effect relationship, and the minor premise, which states the consequence of the condition or the effect of the cause.\n\n2.

In this syllogism, the minor premise denies the antecedent (\"it is raining\"). Therefore, the conclusion must deny the consequent (\"the ground is wet\").\n\n5.
