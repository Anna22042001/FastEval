            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to calculate the confidence interval for the average donation in November.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the standard error of the mean. The standard deviation of the donations is $32, and the sample size is 100, so the standard error of the mean is:\n\n```\nSE = sqrt(32 / 100) = sqrt(0.32) = 0.18\n```\n\nNext, we need to calculate the z-score for our confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, we use a z-score of 1.96.\n\nFinally, we can use the z-score and the standard error of the mean to calculate the confidence interval:\n\n```\nCI = mean +/- z * SE\nCI = 155 +/- 1.96 * 0.18\nCI = 155 +/- 0.36\nCI = [154.64, 155.36]\n```\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement is (C): \"We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\"",

It is a more robust measure of central tendency than the mean, which can be skewed by outliers.\n\nIn this case, the salaries of the highly paid administrators are likely to be much higher than those of the majority of teachers, leading to a high mean but a low median. Quoting the median would highlight the fact that the majority of teachers are earning relatively low salaries, and could be used to argue for a fairer distribution of salaries.\n\nTherefore, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations to support their demand for higher pay.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which among the given options would result in the narrowest confidence interval, we need to consider the relationship between sample size, confidence level, and the width of the confidence interval.\n\nA confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to include the true population parameter, given a certain level of confidence. The width of the confidence interval, or the margin of error, represents the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimate. A smaller margin of error indicates a more precise estimate and a narrower confidence interval.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n- A larger sample size generally leads to a narrower confidence interval, all else being equal. This is because a larger sample provides more information about the population, leading to a more precise estimate.\n- A higher confidence level (e.g., 99% vs. 95%) also leads to a wider confidence interval, as it represents a greater degree of uncertainty. A wider confidence interval means that the range of values is larger, and thus the margin of error is larger.\n\nBased on these points, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) as they both involve a small sample size, which would result in a wider confidence interval.\n\nOption (C) involves a large sample size, which would result in a narrower confidence interval. However, a 95% confidence level is still relatively high, and thus the margin of error would still be relatively large.\n\nOption (D) involves a large sample size and a high confidence level of 99%, which would result in the narrowest confidence interval. This is because a higher confidence level combined with a large sample size provides the most precise estimate and the smallest margin of error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (D) - a large sample size and 99% confidence level would result in the narrowest confidence interval.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a discrete probability distribution is and what properties it has.\n\nA discrete probability distribution is a probability distribution where the random variable X can take on only a finite or countable number of values. For example, if we roll a die, the possible values X can take on are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the probability of each value is equal to 1/6.\n\nNow, let's consider the statements given and determine which ones are true about any discrete probability distribution of a random variable X:\n\n(A) The expected value of X = np.\n\nThe expected value, also known as the mean or average of a probability distribution, is defined as the sum of all possible values of X multiplied by their respective probabilities. In other words, it is the weighted average of all possible values of X.\n\nHowever, this statement is not necessarily true for all discrete probability distributions. For example, if the possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the probability of each value is 1/6, then the expected value of X is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)/6 = 3.5, which is not equal to np, where n is the number of possible values of X.\n\nTherefore, statement (A) is not true for all discrete probability distributions.\n\n(B) The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one.\n\nThis statement is true for all discrete probability distributions. Since the possible values of X can only take on a finite or countable number of values, and the probability of each value must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive), then the sum of all possible values must equal 1.\n\nFor example, if the possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the probability of each value is 1/6, then the sum of all possible values is 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.\n\n(C) The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n\nThis statement is also true for all discrete probability distributions. Since the sum of all possible values of X must equal 1, and the probability of each value must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive), then the probabilities of all possible values must add up to 1.\n\nFor example, if the possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the probability of each value is 1/6, then the probabilities of all possible values add up to 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1.\n\n(D) The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true for all discrete probability distributions. While some probability distributions may be bell-shaped and symmetric, such as the normal distribution, this is not a requirement for all discrete probability distributions.\n\nFor example, if the possible values of X are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the probability of each value is 1/6, then the probability distribution is not bell-shaped or symmetric.\n\nTherefore, statement (D) is not true for all discrete probability distributions.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (C): The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.",
