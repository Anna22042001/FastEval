            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to estimate the number of people in the United States who watch movies at home and the average number of movies they watch per year.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the United States as of July 1, 2021, was approximately 331.4 million people.\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the average American watches about 5 movies per month, or about 60 movies per year. However, this number may be higher for people who primarily watch movies at home.\n\nBased on these estimates, we can calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year as follows:\n\nNumber of movies watched in homes = Population of the United States x Average number of movies watched per year\nNumber of movies watched in homes = 331.4 million x 60 movies per year\nNumber of movies watched in homes = 19.84 billion movies per year\n\nBased on these calculations, the answer to the question is (C) 20,000,000,000 movies.",

While counting is a useful skill, it does not inherently involve comparison. This task does not directly target the concept of comparison.\n\nTask (B) has students put one apple in the middle of their place mat. While this task involves a single apple, it does not involve comparison of quantities. This task also does not directly target the concept of comparison.\n\nTask (C) has students make a Venn diagram for the color of the apples. While a Venn diagram can be used to compare quantities, this task does not directly involve comparing the quantities of red and yellow apples. This task involves comparing the colors of the apples, but not the quantities.\n\nTask (D) has students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal. This task directly involves comparing the quantities of red and yellow apples, which is the most relevant to the concept of comparison. Therefore, task (D) is the best choice for teaching students to compare quantities.\n\nThe final answer is (D).",
