            "model_answer": "To determine which of the provided options a successor auditor would ask the predecessor auditor to provide after accepting an audit engagement, we need to consider the purpose of a successor auditor. A successor auditor is engaged to continue an audit that was previously conducted by another auditor, known as the predecessor auditor. The purpose of a successor auditor is to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to enable them to form an opinion on the financial statements for the current period in the context of the audit conducted by the predecessor auditor.\n\nOption (A) - Disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management as to significant accounting policies and principles - is not relevant to the successor auditor's objective of obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion on the financial statements for the current period. Disagreements between the predecessor auditor and management regarding significant accounting policies and principles are not likely to provide the successor auditor with additional information that would assist them in forming an opinion on the financial statements for the current period.\n\nOption (B) - The predecessor auditor's understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors - is relevant to the successor auditor's objective of obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion on the financial statements for the current period. The successor auditor may ask the predecessor auditor for their understanding of the reasons for the change of auditors to gain insight into any potential issues or concerns that the predecessor auditor may have identified during their audit that could impact the successor auditor's audit.\n\nOption (C) - Facts known to the predecessor auditor that might bear on the integrity of management - is relevant to the successor auditor's objective of obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion on the financial statements for the current period. The successor auditor may ask the predecessor auditor for any facts that they are aware of that could impact the integrity of management, as this could have a significant impact on the financial statements for the current period.\n\nOption (D) - Matters that may facilitate the evaluation of financial reporting consistency between the current and prior years - is relevant to the successor auditor's objective of obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion on the financial statements for the current period. The successor auditor may ask the predecessor auditor for any matters that could assist in evaluating the consistency of financial reporting between the current and prior years, as this could provide valuable insight into any potential changes or trends that may have occurred.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (C).",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what quality control policies and procedures are and what they entail in a CPA firm's auditing practice. Quality control policies and procedures are a set of guidelines and processes that CPA firms follow to ensure the quality and consistency of their audit work. They are designed to help firms identify and mitigate risks, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their audits, and comply with professional standards.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Acceptance of a client relationship.\nThis is not a quality control policy or procedure specific to a CPA firm's auditing practice. It is a general business practice that applies to all client relationships, not just audit clients.\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management.\nProfessional skepticism is an important element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures in its auditing practice. It refers to the attitude and mindset of auditors to approach their work with a critical eye and a questioning mind. Auditors should be skeptical of the information provided by management and should challenge assumptions and assertions to ensure that the financial statements are accurate and complete.\n\n(C) Computer information processing.\nWhile computer information processing is an important aspect of an audit, it is not a quality control policy or procedure. Quality control policies and procedures focus on the processes and procedures that CPA firms follow to ensure the quality of their audits, not on the specific tools or technologies used.\n\n(D) Efficiency of organizational structures.\nWhile the efficiency of organizational structures is important for a CPA firm's auditing practice, it is not a quality control policy or procedure. Quality control policies and procedures focus on the specific processes and procedures that CPA firms follow to ensure the quality of their audits, not on the overall structure of the firm.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (B) Professional skepticism of management.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C). A shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder owning at least $5000 worth of stock.\n\nThe right of a shareholder to inspect corporate books and records is a statutory right provided under the laws of many jurisdictions. However, this right is not absolute and is subject to certain conditions. One of these conditions is that the demanding shareholder must own at least $5000 worth of stock in the corporation.\n\nThe purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the shareholder has a sufficient financial interest in the corporation to justify the inspection of its books and records. This helps to prevent frivolous or vexatious requests for inspection.\n\nTherefore, while it is true that the right to inspect corporate books and records exists when fraud or illegality is alleged, and that it is conditioned upon the demanding shareholder having a proper purpose, these factors are not the only conditions that apply.",

Interest rate on funds used: 10%\n2. Compensating balance: 15%\n3. Commitment fee: 1% on the unused amount of the credit line\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the amount of the unused credit line. This is done by subtracting the amount borrowed ($200,000) from the total credit line ($500,000):\n\n$500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000\n\nNext, we need to calculate the commitment fee. This is done by multiplying the unused credit line by the commitment fee rate (1%):\n\n$300,000 x 1% = $3,000\n\nFinally, we need to add the interest rate on funds used, the commitment fee, and the compensating balance to get the effective annual interest cost:\n\n$3,000 + $10,000 + $30,000 = $43,000\n\nDividing the effective annual interest cost by the amount borrowed gives us the effective annual interest rate:\n\n$43,000 / $200,000 = 21.5%\n\nSince option (D) is the only choice that is closest to 21.5%, the correct answer is (D) 13.53 percent.",
