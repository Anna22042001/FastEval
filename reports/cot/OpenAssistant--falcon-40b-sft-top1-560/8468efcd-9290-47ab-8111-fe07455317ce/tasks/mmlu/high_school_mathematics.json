First, we need to find the coordinates of the final point. We know that the person walked 3 miles to the east, then turned north and walked 10 miles, then turned west and walked 6 miles, and finally turned south and walked 16 miles.\n\n2. We can represent these steps as a sequence of vectors:\n\n(3, 0) + (0, 10) + (-6, 0) + (0, -16)\n\n3. The final point is the sum of these vectors, which is:\n\n(3, 0) + (0, 10) + (-6, 0) + (0, -16) = (3, 10)\n\n4. Now we can use the distance formula to find the distance from the starting point:\n\nd = \u221a((3 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2)\n\n5. We can simplify this expression by squaring both sides:\n\nd^2 = (3 - x)^2 + (10 - y)^2\n\n6. We can further simplify this expression by adding 3x and 10y to both sides, and then subtracting 3x and 10y from both sides:\n\nd^2 - 3x + 10y - 3x - 10y = 3x^2 + 10y^2\n\nd^2 - 13x - 10y = 3x^2 + 10y^2\n\n7.

Finally, we can plug in the value of x into the distance formula to find the distance from the starting point:\n\nd = \u221a((3 - 10y/3)^2 + (10 - y)^2)\nd = \u221a((3 - 10y/3)^2 + (10 - y)^2)\nd = \u221a((3 - 10y/3)^2 + (10 - 10y/3)^2)\nd = \u221a((3 - 10y/3)^2 - (20y/3 - 30)^2)\nd = \u221a((3 - 10y/3) - (20y/3 - 30))\nd = \u221a(3 - 10y/3) - \u221a(20y/3 - 30)\n\n10. We can simplify this expression by taking the absolute value of both sides:\n\nabs(d) = abs(\u221a(3 - 10y/3)) - abs(\u221a(20y/3 - 30))\n\n11. We can then find the absolute value of both sides:\n\nabs(d) = abs(\u221a(3 - 10y/3))\n\n12. Finally, we can plug in the value of x that we found in step 8 into the distance formula to find the absolute value of d:\n\nabs(d) = abs(\u221a((3 - 10y/3)^2 + (10 - y)^2))\nabs(d) = abs(\u221a((3 - 10y/3)^2 + (10 - 10y/3)^2))\nabs(d) = abs(\u221a((3 - 10y/3) - (20y/3 - 30))\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of the distance from the starting point is:\n\nabs(d) = abs(\u221a(3 - 10y/3))\n\nAnd the answer is:\n\nOption B: 6.7 miles",
