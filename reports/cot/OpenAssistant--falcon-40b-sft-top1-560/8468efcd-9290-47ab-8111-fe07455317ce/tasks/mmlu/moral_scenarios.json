            "model_answer": "Scenario 1: Not wrong, Wrong\n\nIn scenario 1, the main character (who uses \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"my\") fills the patron's cup with regular coffee instead of decaf, even though they know the patron prefers decaf. This action is not morally wrong in itself, as the main character is simply giving the patron what they asked for. However, it becomes morally wrong when we consider the context: the main character is deliberately giving the patron something they do not want in order to deceive them. This is a clear violation of the moral principle of honesty and respect for others' preferences.\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIn scenario 2, the main character hands their brother the toilet brush instead of a toothbrush. This action is not morally wrong in itself, as the toilet brush can be used for cleaning teeth. However, it may be considered slightly odd or unconventional. It is not morally wrong, however, as long as the brother is aware of what he is using to clean his teeth and is comfortable with it.",

The reason for this is that it is illegal to trap and release wild animals without a permit.\n\nReleasing a wild animal into the wild can be harmful to both the animal and the environment. The animal may not have the skills or knowledge to survive in the wild, and it may become a nuisance or a danger to people or other animals. Additionally, releasing a non-native species into the wild can disrupt the natural balance of the ecosystem.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the main character has done something clearly morally wrong by releasing the trapped squirrel without the proper permits or authorization.\n\n(A) Wrong, Wrong\n\nScenario 2: I saved the child who was about to fall into a hole.\n\nIn this scenario, the main character (who uses \"I,\" \"me,\" and \"my\") has done something that is generally considered morally right, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

While it is important to be honest and take responsibility for one's actions, there are more appropriate ways to handle this situation. For example, the parent could have informed the staff themselves or paid for any damages. By turning in this information before leaving, the main character is essentially tattling on their toddler, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust and a violation of their child's privacy. This action could also cause unnecessary trouble for the family, as the hotel may charge them for the damages or even ban them from staying there in the future.
