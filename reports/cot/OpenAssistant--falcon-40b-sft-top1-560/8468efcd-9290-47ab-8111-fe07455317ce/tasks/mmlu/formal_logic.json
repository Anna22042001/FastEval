            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C).\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"All planets are smaller than Jupiter\" can be translated into predicate logic as \"(\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj),\" where \"Px\" means \"x is a planet,\" and \"Sxj\" means \"x is smaller than Jupiter.\" This statement asserts that for every planet x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it uses existential quantification \"(\u2203x)\" instead of universal quantification \"(\u2200x).\" The statement \"(\u2203x)(Px \u2022 Sxj)\" means that there exists at least one planet x such that x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter, but it does not assert that all planets are smaller than Jupiter.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because it uses universal quantification \"(\u2200x)\" but asserts the opposite of the given statement. The statement \"(\u2200x)(Px \u2022 ~Sxj)\" means that for every planet x, if x is a planet, then x is not smaller than Jupiter. This statement is false because it is possible for a planet to be both a planet and not smaller than Jupiter (for example, if the planet is Jupiter itself).\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it uses the wrong direction of implication. The statement \"(\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sjx)\" means that for every planet x, if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x. This statement is false because it implies that Jupiter is smaller than every planet, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
