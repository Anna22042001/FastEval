            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given statements is a benefit that mycorrhizal fungi confer to many plants, we need to analyze each statement individually.\n\nStatement (A): Mycorrhizal fungi protect plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats.\nWhile mycorrhizal fungi can help plants access water and nutrients in the soil, they do not provide direct protection from desiccation. In fact, some studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungi can actually increase a plant's vulnerability to drought stress (1).\n\nStatement (B): They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.\nThis statement is correct. Mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, where the fungi obtain carbohydrates from the plant in exchange for providing nutrients, including nitrogen, to the plant (2). This process of nitrogen fixation is particularly important for plants growing in nitrogen-limited soils.\n\nStatement (C): They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\nThis statement is also correct. Mycorrhizal fungi can increase a plant's access to phosphorus in the soil by extending their network of hyphae and increasing the surface area for absorption (3). This is especially beneficial for plants growing in phosphorus-limited soils.\n\nStatement (D): They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.\nWhile mycorrhizal fungi do obtain carbon from plants, this statement oversimplifies the relationship between the two organisms. The exchange of nutrients between mycorrhizal fungi and plants is a complex and dynamic process that involves a variety of factors, including the type of mycorrhizal fungus and the needs of the plant (4).\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is (B) - They fix nitrogen, which is particularly important for plants in nitrogen-limited habitats.",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement concerning the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote is (A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is a complex organelle found in eukaryotic cells that is involved in the processing and modification of proteins and lipids. It receives materials from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the form of small vesicles and modifies them before sending them out of the cell in other vesicles.\n\nStatement (B) is incorrect because small secretory vesicles are typically associated with the trans face of the Golgi apparatus, not the cis face. Statement (C) is also incorrect because the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are not necessarily flattened and are not necessarily continuous with one another.\n\nStatement (D) is incorrect because glycosylation, the process of adding sugar molecules to proteins, typically occurs after a protein has been transported through the Golgi apparatus and is located in a vesicle near the trans face.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is (A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.",

Instead, it binds at a different location on the enzyme, known as the allosteric site. This binding prevents the substrate from binding to the active site, thus reducing the enzyme's activity.\n\nUnlike a competitive inhibitor, a non-competitive inhibitor binds to the active site of an enzyme and directly blocks the catalytic activity of the enzyme.\n\nIrreversible inhibitors, on the other hand, form covalent bonds with the enzyme and permanently modify its structure, leading to its inactivation.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is incorrect as competitive inhibitors do not form covalent links with the enzyme.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect as competitive inhibitors do not modify the amino acid residues of the active site.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect as competitive inhibitors do not decrease the number of enzyme molecules, but rather they decrease the enzyme's activity by binding to the allosteric site.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe acrosomal reaction is a process in which the sperm's acrosome, a specialized organelle that contains enzymes necessary for fertilization, fuses with the egg's plasma membrane. This reaction is triggered by the binding of ZP3 receptors on the sperm's membrane to ZP3 on the egg's zona pellucida. Therefore, injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would be expected to block the acrosomal reaction and, thus, inhibit fertilization.\n\nHowever, (B), (C), and (D) would not be expected. Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs would not be expected to block in vitro fertilization because this would saturate the ZP3 receptors on the sperm's membrane, preventing them from binding to ZP3 on the egg's zona pellucida and triggering the acrosomal reaction. Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads because ZP2 does not bind to ZP3 receptors on the sperm's membrane. Finally, incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would not be expected to block in vitro fertilization because the antibodies would bind to ZP3 on the egg's zona pellucida, not on the sperm's membrane.",
