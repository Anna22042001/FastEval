Increasing the clock cycle rate: This would allow more instructions to be executed per second, but if the CPI (cycles per instruction) remains the same, then the total execution time for a program would not be reduced.\n\n2. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline: Forwarding allows instructions to be executed out of order, which can improve performance by reducing idle time.

For example, if Bob wrote down the number 500, Mary could not identify the number with just one question. She might need to ask questions like:\n\n\"Is the number you wrote down less than 600?\"\n\"Is the number you wrote down an even number?\"\n\"Is the number you wrote down divisible by 5?\"\n\nBased on these examples, we can see that the minimum number of questions that Mary would need to ask in order to identify a number could range from 1 to an infinite number of questions, depending on the specific number that Bob wrote down.\n\nTherefore, in the worst case scenario, Mary could potentially need to ask an infinite number of questions in order to identify the number that Bob wrote down.\n\nHowever, we can also see that there are many numbers (such as the prime numbers) for which Mary could identify the number with just a few questions.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to determine exactly how many questions Mary would need to ask in the worst case scenario.\n\nHowever, we can use mathematical analysis to determine an upper bound on the number of questions that Mary would need to ask.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the pigeonhole principle, which states that if you have more items than containers, then some containers must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, we can think of the numbers that Bob could have written down as the \"items,\" and the questions that Mary asks as the \"containers.\"\n\nIf there are 1,000 possible numbers that Bob could have written down, and Mary needs to ask an infinite number of questions in the worst case scenario, then there must be some numbers for which Mary would need to ask more than one question in order to identify them.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the upper bound on the number of questions that Mary would need to ask is 1,000.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can say that the correct answer is (D) 10.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of stack-based storage allocation and static allocation, and how they relate to the language features listed in the options.\n\nStack-based storage allocation refers to the process of allocating memory for variables and other data structures on a stack, which is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created on the stack, which contains the local variables and other data structures used by that function. When the function returns, the stack frame is popped off the stack, and the memory it was using is deallocated.\n\nStatic allocation, on the other hand, refers to the process of allocating memory for variables and other data structures at compile time, and keeping them in memory for the duration of the program. This memory is typically located in a separate area of memory called the data segment.\n\nNow let's consider the language features listed in the options:\n\n1. Recursive procedures: A recursive procedure is a procedure that calls itself. When a recursive procedure is called, a new stack frame is created for it, and the procedure continues to execute until it returns. If static allocation were used for recursive procedures, there would be a risk of running out of memory if the procedure were to make too many recursive calls, as each call would create a new copy of the procedure's local variables and other data structures. Therefore, stack-based storage allocation is required for recursive procedures to ensure that memory is deallocated when the procedure returns, and to prevent memory leaks.\n\n2. Arbitrary goto's: An arbitrary goto is a type of goto statement that can jump to any label in the program, regardless of where the goto statement is located. If static allocation were used for procedures that contain arbitrary goto statements, it would be difficult to determine which variables and other data structures need to be deallocated when the procedure returns. Therefore, stack-based storage allocation is required to ensure that memory is deallocated correctly when an arbitrary goto statement is used.\n\n3. Two-dimensional arrays: A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays, where each element of the outer array is itself an array. When a two-dimensional array is declared, the compiler needs to allocate memory for both the outer array and the inner arrays. If static allocation were used for two-dimensional arrays, it would be difficult to determine how much memory to allocate for each array, and there would be a risk of memory leaks if the arrays were not deallocated correctly. Therefore, stack-based storage allocation is required to ensure that memory is deallocated correctly when a two-dimensional array is used.\n\n4. Integer-valued functions: An integer-valued function is a function that returns an integer value. There is no reason why static allocation would be required for integer-valued functions, as they do not allocate any memory on the stack. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is option (C) - two-dimensional arrays. Two-dimensional arrays require stack-based storage allocation because the compiler needs to allocate memory for both the outer array and the inner arrays, and because the size of the arrays may not be known at compile time.",

However, with careful design, it is still possible to pipeline instructions with variable-length encoding.\n\n(C) Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute: This can make it more difficult to keep the pipeline full, as some instructions will take longer than others.

Round-robin: In round-robin scheduling, each job is given an equal time slice before the next job is scheduled. While this policy is simple and fair, it does not guarantee that no job will wait indefinitely for service. If a job takes longer than its time slice, it will be preempted and the next job in the queue will be scheduled. This can lead to starvation if a job repeatedly takes longer than its time slice.\n\n2. Priority queuing: Priority queuing assigns a priority to each job and schedules them based on their priority. Higher-priority jobs are given preference over lower-priority jobs. While this policy can prevent starvation for high-priority jobs, it may still lead to starvation for low-priority jobs if there are too many high-priority jobs in the queue.\n\n3. Shortest job first: Shortest job first (SJF) schedules the job with the shortest estimated completion time. This policy can prevent starvation, as the shortest job will always be scheduled first.
