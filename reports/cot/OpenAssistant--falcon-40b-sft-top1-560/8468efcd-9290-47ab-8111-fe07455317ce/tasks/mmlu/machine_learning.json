A network with too few hidden nodes may not be able to capture complex relationships, leading to underfitting. On the other hand, a network with too many hidden nodes may overfit the training data, resulting in poor generalization performance.\n\nThe learning rate, initial choice of weights, and use of a constant-term unit input are all factors that can affect the convergence of the training process and the performance of the model, but they do not directly impact the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) the number of hidden nodes.",

While it is true that CPUs were used in the early days of deep learning, GPUs have become the standard for training large neural networks due to their ability to perform matrix operations much faster than CPUs. GPUs are designed specifically for parallel processing, which is essential for training deep neural networks that involve millions or even billions of parameters.\n\nStatement 2: The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters.\n\nThis statement is true. ResNet-50 is a deep convolutional neural network that was introduced in 2015 and has become a popular choice for image classification tasks. It has over 1 billion parameters, making it one of the largest neural networks in use today.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the correct answer is (C) True, False.",

A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies. Each node in the graph represents a random variable, and each edge represents a conditional dependency between two random variables.\n\nIn the given Bayesian network, there are four nodes: H, U, P, and W. We need to determine how many independent parameters are needed to specify this network. An independent parameter is a parameter that is not influenced by any other parameter in the network.\n\nTo determine the number of independent parameters, we need to identify the parents of each node. The parents of a node are the nodes that directly influence it. In the given network, the parents of node H are not specified, so we assume that it has no parents. The parents of node U are H and U itself (since it is a feedback node). The parents of node P are H and U, and the parents of node W are H and P.\n\nNow, we can count the number of independent parameters needed to specify this network. The number of independent parameters for a node is equal to the number of its parents minus one. So, the number of independent parameters for node H is 0, since it has no parents. The number of independent parameters for node U is 1, since it has one parent (itself). The number of independent parameters for node P is 2, since it has two parents (H and U). And the number of independent parameters for node W is 2, since it has two parents (H and P).\n\nAdding up these numbers, we get a total of 5 independent parameters needed to specify this Bayesian network.
