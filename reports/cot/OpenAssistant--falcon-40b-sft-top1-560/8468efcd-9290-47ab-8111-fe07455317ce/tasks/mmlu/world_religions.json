            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The genre of Sikh literature denoted by the term \"janam-sakhis\" is birth narratives.\n\nJanam-sakhis are biographical accounts of the lives of the ten Sikh Gurus and other prominent figures in Sikh history. They are written in Punjabi and are an important part of the Sikh tradition.\n\nJanam-sakhis are considered to be a form of hagiography, which is the writing of the lives of saints or religious figures in a way that emphasizes their spiritual greatness and miraculous powers. However, unlike some other forms of hagiography, janam-sakhis are generally considered to be relatively accurate historical accounts, based on eyewitness testimony and other primary sources.\n\nThe term \"janam-sakhis\" literally means \"birth stories,\" and these narratives typically focus on the birth, childhood, and early life of the subject, as well as their spiritual development and eventual attainment of enlightenment. They often include stories of miraculous events and divine interventions, and they are intended to inspire devotion and reverence in the reader.\n\nIn conclusion, janam-sakhis are a genre of Sikh literature that are focused on the birth and early life of important figures in Sikh history, and they are considered to be an important part of the Sikh tradition.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to examine the Egyptian composition Ludul Bel Nemequi and understand how it portrays Marduk.\n\nLudul Bel Nemequi is a Babylonian creation myth that tells the story of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon. In the myth, Marduk is portrayed as a powerful and wise deity who battles the chaos monster Tiamat and emerges victorious. He then creates the world and establishes himself as its ruler.\n\nSo, based on this information, we can eliminate answer choices A and B, as they do not accurately reflect the portrayal of Marduk in Ludul Bel Nemequi.\n\nThat leaves us with answer choices C and D. To determine which of these is correct, we need to consider the specific characteristics of Marduk as portrayed in the myth.\n\nMarduk is often depicted as a warrior god who is willing to use force to maintain order and defeat his enemies. However, he is also seen as a just and fair deity who rewards those who are loyal to him and punishes those who defy him.\n\nBased on this, we can conclude that answer choice D, \"Judging and vengeful,\" is the correct answer. Marduk is portrayed as a deity who is both transcendent (existing beyond the physical world) and immanent (involved in the affairs of humans). He is a powerful judge who rewards and punishes based on his own standards of justice.",

Sacraments are sacred rituals that are believed to be ordained by God and are an outward sign of an inward grace. There are seven sacraments recognized by the Catholic Church, but for the purposes of this question, we will focus on the two sacraments that are celebrated by all Christians: Baptism and Eucharist.\n\nBaptism is the first sacrament that a Christian receives and is considered the gateway to the other sacraments. It is a ritual of purification through water that symbolizes the washing away of sin and the rebirth of the individual as a child of God.\n\nThe Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper, is the second sacrament that all Christians celebrate. It is a ritual that involves the consumption of bread and wine, which are believed to be the body and blood of Christ. The Eucharist is considered to be the most important sacrament in the Christian faith, as it is a way for Christians to receive the grace of God and to unite themselves with Christ and with one another.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Baptism and Eucharist.",
