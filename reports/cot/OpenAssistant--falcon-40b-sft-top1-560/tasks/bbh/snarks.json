            "model_answer": "Before identifying which statement is sarcastic, let's first define sarcasm. Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony in which the intended meaning of a statement is the opposite of its literal meaning. It is often used to convey cynicism, mockery, or disdain.\n\nNow let's consider the two options:\n\n(A) He's a generous person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need\n(B) He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need\n\nOption (A) appears to be a positive statement about a person's character and their charitable actions. However, when read with a sarcastic tone, it can be interpreted as a negative statement that implies the person is not actually generous and is only promoting the charity for selfish reasons.\n\nOption (B) is also a positive statement about a person's charitable actions, but it is presented in a sarcastic tone that implies the speaker thinks the person is actually a terrible person.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (A) is the statement that is most likely to be sarcastic. When read with a sarcastic tone, it can be interpreted as a negative statement about the person's character and their charitable actions.",

This statement ignores the complex nature of depression and the fact that it is not something that can be easily controlled or \"switched off.\" It also implies that the person being spoken to is somehow at fault for their depression, which can be hurtful and insensitive.\n\nOption B: This sentence is also suggesting that it is easy for someone who is depressed to just \"be happy\" and that if they were able to do so, they wouldn't be depressed anymore. However, the use of sarcasm in this sentence indicates that the speaker actually understands that it is not that simple and that depression is a serious and complex issue. This sentence is likely meant to be humorous and may be used to try to lighten the mood or to show support and understanding to someone who is struggling with depression.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that Option B is the sarcastic statement.",

The tone of this statement is mocking and dismissive, implying that the person being addressed is not trying hard enough to improve their financial situation.\n\nOption (B) - \"Have you tried not being rude?\" - This statement also appears to be sarcastic, but for a different reason. While it may seem like not being rude is an easy solution, in reality, it can be challenging to change one's behavior, especially if they are used to being rude. The statement is ironic because it suggests that being rude is a choice, when in fact, it may be a learned behavior or a symptom of underlying issues.\n\nBased on the analysis of the two options, it can be concluded that option (B) is the sarcastic statement.",
