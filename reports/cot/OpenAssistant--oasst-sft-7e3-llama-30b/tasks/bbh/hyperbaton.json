Determine the rules for adjective order in English.\n\nIn English, adjectives are generally placed before the noun they describe. However, there are some rules for how adjectives of different types should be ordered.

So \"purple\" should come next.\n* The origin adjective (\"American\") should come after the shape adjective and before any other descriptive adjectives. So \"American\" should come third.\n* Finally, any adjectives that describe a characteristic of the noun (in this case, \"archaic\" and \"medium-size\") should come before any adjectives that describe an attribute that is not essential to the noun (in this case, \"prismlike\" and \"purple\").\n\nTherefore, the correct adjective order is: \"medium-size, archaic, purple, prismlike, American, car\", which corresponds to option (B).",

Adjectives generally go in the following order: opinion, size, age, color, nationality, shape. In this case, we need to decide between two options that don't follow this order exactly.\n2. The first option, (A), has \"terrible\" first. While \"terrible\" could be an opinion, it is not a typical one to use to describe a sock. It's more likely that someone would use an opinion adjective later in the list to describe a sock.\n3. The second option, (B), has \"new\" first. This is more likely to be a helpful descriptor for a sock because it provides information about the sock's condition.\n4. The second option also has \"tiny\" next, which is a size adjective. This makes sense because the sock is described as \"new square Egyptian typing sock,\" so \"tiny\" could modify \"sock\" to give more information about its size.\n5. The third adjective in the second option is \"Egyptian,\" which is a nationality adjective. This makes sense because the sock is described as \"new square Egyptian typing sock,\" so \"Egyptian\" could modify \"sock\" to give more information about where it is from.\n6. The fourth adjective in the second option is \"typing,\" which is a shape adjective. This makes sense because \"sock\" could be modified by an adjective that describes its shape.\n7. The fifth adjective in the second option is \"terrible,\" which is an opinion adjective.
