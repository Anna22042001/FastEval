Therefore, the formula becomes:\n```scss\nDay of the week = 2 - 1 for January\n```\nSimplifying, we get:\n```scss\nDay of the week = 1\n```\nThis tells us that the first Monday of 2019 was a Tuesday.\n\nNext, we need to determine the first day of the month. Recall that January 1, 2019 was a Tuesday. To determine the first day of the month, we can use the following formula:\n```scss\n1st of the month = previous multiple of 7 less 6\n```\nSince January 1, 2019 was a Tuesday, we see that the first multiple of seven less six is June 18, 2018 (a Tuesday). Therefore, the first day of 2019 was December 31, 2018 (a Monday).\n\nFinally, we can apply the calendrical formula to determine the date one year ago from today.

            "model_answer": "To determine the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY, we need to first determine the current date. We know that 176 days have passed since March 20, 2020, so we can add that number of days to March 20, 2020 to get the current date.\n\nThe number of days between March 20, 2020 and today can be calculated by adding the number of days in the months between March and today, and the number of days in the years between 2020 and today. We know that today is after September 13, 2020 because option (A) and (B) have already been eliminated. So, we only need to check the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nIn 2020, the number of days between March 20 and September 14 is 194 days, and if we add 176 days to March 20, 2020, the result is September 17, 2020. In 2021, the number of days between March 20 and September 14 is 222 days, and if we add 176 days to March 20, 2020, the result is September 1, 2021. In 2022, the number of days between March 20 and September 13 is 248 days, and if we add 176 days to March 20, 2020, the result is July 26, 2022, which is after September 13. Therefore, the current date must be September 14, 2022, which is the",
