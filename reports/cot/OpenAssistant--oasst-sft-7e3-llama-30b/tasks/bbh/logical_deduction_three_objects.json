In this case, the relevant information is that there are three birds on a branch, and their positions are described in relation to each other.\n\nStep 2: Examine the first statement that describes a relationship between two birds: \"The robin is to the right of the crow.\" This statement could be interpreted and rephrased in various ways, but the most straightforward and logical way to understand it is that the crow is on the left. The robin is on the right, which means that the birds are in the opposite order of their usual appearance (where the crow is often considered the symbol of death and thus the leftmost bird).\n\nStep 3: Examine the second statement that describes another relationship between two different birds: \"The robin is to the left of the blue jay.\" This statement could also be interpreted and rephrased in various ways, but the most straightforward and logical way to understand it is that the blue jay is on the right. The robin is on the left, which means that the birds are in the correct order but with the robin in between.\n\nStep 4: Combine the information from both statements and try to deduce the rightmost bird. If the crow is on the left, and the blue jay is on the right of the robin, then the blue jay cannot be the rightmost bird. If the robin is to the left of the blue jay, then the crow cannot be the leftmost bird. Therefore, both answers (A) and (B) are incorrect.

            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "To start, we can eliminate option (C) immediately, as we know that Ana finished second.\n\nNext, we can look at the order in which the golfers finished. Since we know that Ana finished second, and we know that Mel finished last, we can deduce that Ada finished first.\n\nTherefore, we can eliminate option (B) as well, as Ada did not finish last.\n\nThe answer must be (A) Mel finished last.",
