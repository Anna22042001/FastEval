In this case, we are given three players, their roles at the start of the match, and the sequence of position swaps.\n\nStep 2: Use a tree diagram or other visual aid to organize the information and track the changes over time. Here's an example:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lwL6LzO.png\" alt=\"Tree diagram tracking the soccer positions and the history of position swaps\">\n\nStep 3: Identify the roles of the players at each step in the match. For example, at the start, Alice is cheerleader, Bob is right winger, and Claire is benchwarmer. After the first swap, Claire takes on Alice's cheerleader position, while Alice becomes a benchwarmer. We can add these new roles to the diagram.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lwL6LzO.png\" alt=\"Tree diagram tracking the soccer positions and the history of position swaps, updated with the roles of the players at each step\">\n\nStep 4: Continue to track the changes in positions in the same manner, including the final roles of each player when the match ends.\n\nStep 5: The answer is on the diagram, so let's locate it. We want to find the final position of Alice. We can do this by looking for the letter 'A' on the diagram, and see that it's associated with the cheerleader role, which means that Alice is playing cheerleader at the end of the match. The answer is therefore (A).\n\nFinal answer: (A) cheerleader.",

            "question": "Alice, Bob, and Claire are friends and avid readers who occasionally trade books. At the start of the semester, they each buy one new book: Alice gets The Great Gatsby, Bob gets Frankenstein, and Claire gets Ulysses.\nAs the semester proceeds, they start trading around the new books. First, Alice and Claire swap books. Then, Bob and Claire swap books. Finally, Claire and Alice swap books. At the end of the semester, Alice has\nOptions:\n(A) The Great Gatsby\n(B) Frankenstein\n(C) Ulysses",
            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, let's first label the three friends by A, B, and C. By symmetry, we know that the answer must not depend on the names Alice, Bob, or Claire. So let's make that our first assumption:\n\nAssumption 1: The names Alice, Bob, and Claire are irrelevant to the solution.\n\nNext, we are told that each of them buys one new book at the start of the semester, and that these books are The Great Gatsby, Frankenstein, and Ulysses, respectively. Let's represent these books as G, F, and U, respectively. Now, there are three friends (A, B, and C), and three books (G, F, and U). Since each friend buys one book, we can make the following assignments:\n\nA = G\nB = F\nC = U\n\nThese assignments correspond to the beginning of the semester when each friend buys one book. Now we need to keep track of how these books get swapped around. We do this using a double-sided arrow, like this:\n\nG -> F\nF -> U\nU -> G\n\nThese arrows indicate that a book from the left is swapped with a book on the right. We know that Alice and Claire swap books first, then Bob and Claire swap books, and finally Claire and Alice swap books. We can use these arrow to represent the book swaps:\n\nG -> F\nF -> U\nU -> G\n\nNow we have all the information we need to solve the problem. At the end of the semester, each friend has one book. Let's check each one:\n\nA: We know that Alice starts with G. After the first swap, she has F. After the second swap, she ends up with G again",
