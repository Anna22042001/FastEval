So this option is not correct.\n* Option (B) one: We need to check if there is at least one non-magenta item to the right of the red item. The fuchsia teddy bear is not magenta, so it counts as one non-magenta item. If there are no other non-magenta items to the right of the red item, then this option would be correct.\n* Option (C) two: If we assume that there is at least one non-magenta item to the right of the red item, we have the fuchsia teddy bear and possibly another non-magenta item. If there are two non-magenta items, then we must have two non-magenta items in a row to the right of the red item.
