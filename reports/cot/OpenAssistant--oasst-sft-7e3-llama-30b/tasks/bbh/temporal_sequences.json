            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "The basketball court was closed after 10pm, so we know that Jessica could not have gone to the basketball court between 10pm and when she woke up at 5am. Thus, the earliest possible time that Jessica could have gone to the basketball court would have been between 5am and when she woke up at 5am.\n\nHowever, we know that Michael saw Jessica buying clothes at the mall between 5am and 6am, which means that Jessica could not have gone to the basketball court during this time.\n\nNext, Steven saw Jessica buying a bike at the bike shop between 6am and 7am, which again means that Jessica could not have gone to the basketball court during this time.\n\nBetween 7am and 2pm, Sean saw Jessica waiting at the train station, so Jessica could not have gone to the basketball court during this time either.\n\nAfter 2pm and until 6pm, Elizabeth saw Jessica taking photos near the Eiffel Tower, so it is also not possible for Jessica to have gone to the basketball court during this time.\n\nAt 6pm, Sarah saw Jessica walking towards the Statue of Liberty, which means that the earliest possible time after that for Jessica to have gone to the basketball court would have been 9pm. However, we know that the basketball court was closed after 10pm, which means that it was not open from 9pm to 10pm. Therefore, the answer is option (D) 2pm to 6pm.\n\n(D)",

            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "The first step in solving this problem is to identify the key pieces of information. Ashley woke up at 5am and was seen by Jason buying lunch at a deli between 11am and 1pm. We also know that Emily saw Ashley driving to a water park between 1pm and 3pm, Kimberly saw Ashley stretching at a yoga studio between 3pm and 6pm, and the bookstore was closed after 6pm.\n\nThe next step is to identify the relevant time constraints. Ashley must have gone to the bookstore sometime between when they woke up and when the bookstore closed. This means that the possible time range is between 5am and 6pm.\n\nThe next step is to eliminate any options that are outside of this time range. Option (A) is from 1pm to 3pm, which is outside of the possible time range. Similarly, option (B) is from 11am to 1pm, which is also outside of the possible time range.\n\nThe only remaining options are (C) and (D). Option (C) is from 3pm to 6pm, which includes the time when Emily saw Ashley driving to the water park. However, it does not include the time when Jason saw Ashley buying lunch at the deli. Option (D) is from 5am to 11am, which includes the time when Jason saw Ashley buying lunch at the deli, but it does not include the time when Emily saw Ashley driving to the water park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 5am to 11am.",
