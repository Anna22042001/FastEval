We know that he woke up at 5am and the gas station is closed after 9pm, so we need to find a time window between these two constraints.\n\nWe can eliminate the options:\n\n* (A) 5am to 7am: This time frame is too early, as Jennifer would have already seen David taking photos.\n* (B) 7am to 9am: This time frame is too late, as Jennifer would have already seen David taking photos.\n* (D) 9am to 3pm: This time frame is too late, as Kimberly would have already seen David buying a bike.\n\nThe only possible time frame left is:\n\n* (C) 3pm to 9pm: This time frame works, as it starts after Kimberly saw David buying a bike and ends before Linda saw David walking towards the Statue of Liberty.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) 3pm to 9pm",
