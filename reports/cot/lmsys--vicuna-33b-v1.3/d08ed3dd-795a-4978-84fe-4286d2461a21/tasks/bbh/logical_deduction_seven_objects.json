The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.\n6. The bus is the second-oldest.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the minivan is the third-newest, so it cannot be the third-oldest.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the limousine is the fourth-newest, so it cannot be the third-oldest.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the station wagon is newer than the hatchback, so the hatchback cannot be the third-oldest.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that the bus is the second-oldest, so it cannot be the third-oldest.\n\nFrom the list of vehicles in order from oldest to newest, we can see that the tractor is the third-oldest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(E) The tractor is the third-oldest",
