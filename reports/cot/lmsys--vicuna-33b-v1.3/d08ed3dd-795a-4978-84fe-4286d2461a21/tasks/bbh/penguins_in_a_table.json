            "model_answer": "To determine the number of species listed in the table, we need to first understand what a species is in this context. A species is a group of organisms that can breed with one another to produce fertile offspring. In this case, we are talking about penguins.\n\n1. Count the number of unique names in the table:\nThere are 5 unique names: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, and Louis.\n2. Check if the names with the same age are the same penguin:\nLouis is listed twice with age 7. Since it is the same penguin, we only consider it as one species.\n3. Count the number of different ages:\nThere are 5 different ages: 7, 5, 9, 8, and 7 (since Louis is listed twice).\n4. Check if the ages correspond to different penguins:\nThe age 7 corresponds to Louis, and the age 5 corresponds to Bernard. Since these two ages have different names, they represent two different species.\n5. Check if the ages 9 and 11 correspond to different penguins:\nThe age 9 corresponds to Vincent, and the age 11 corresponds to both Louis and Gwen. Since Vincent and Louis have different names, they represent two different species. However, Gwen also has age 11, and Louis is listed twice with age 11. We need to check if Gwen and Louis are the same penguin.\n6. Check if the names with the same age and height are the same penguin:\nGwen and Louis both have age 11 and height 50 cm. Since they have the same age and height, they are the same penguin.\n7. Count the number of unique heights:\nThere are 4 unique heights: 50, 80, 60, and 70 cm.\n8. Check if the heights correspond to different penguins:\nThe height 50 cm corresponds to both Gwen and Louis, so they represent one species. The height 80 cm corresponds to Bernard, and the height 60 cm corresponds to Vincent, so they represent two different species. The height 70 cm corresponds to Gwen, and since it is the only penguin with this height, it represents one species.\n\nAfter analyzing the data, we find that there are 3 different species of penguins listed in the table.\n\nThe answer is (C) 3.",
