The acceptable amount of wobble may vary, but it is generally expected to be minimal.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption (A) describes the wheel wobbling \"several millimeters\" in either direction. This amount of wobble is likely to be considered normal or acceptable for a bicycle wheel.\nOption (B) describes the wheel wobbling \"several feet\" in either direction. This amount of wobble is clearly excessive and would likely indicate a safety issue with the bicycle.\n\nBased on this analysis, option (B) is the sarcastic statement because it exaggerates the acceptable amount of wobble to an absurd extent, which contradicts the expected safety standards for a bicycle.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

Sarcasm is often used to express the opposite of what a person really means.\n\n(A) This statement appears to be sarcastic because the speaker is expressing disbelief that the other person would only be interested in bullies with narcissistic personality disorder. The use of \"You mean\" followed by a dramatic twist on the original statement is a common pattern in sarcasm.\n\n(B) This statement, however, is a straightforward question that doesn't have any indication of sarcasm. It simply asks for confirmation on whether the person is not into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nTherefore, the sarcastic statement is:\n\n(A) You mean you're only into bullies with narcissistic personality disorder?",

This adjective might be a clue that the statement is sarcastic.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. In option A, the speaker is expressing mock appreciation for a baseless accusation, which indicates sarcasm.\n2. In option B, the speaker is using the adjective \"striking\" to further emphasize the absurdity of the baseless accusation, implying sarcasm.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) What a striking, baseless accusation",

Sarcasm is a form of irony that is often used to express the opposite of what one truly feels or believes.

Always glad to feed the elephants, that woefully endangered species\nIn this option, the speaker seems to be genuinely happy to feed elephants, which are an endangered species. There is no indication of sarcasm, as the statement appears to be positive and supportive.\n\n(B) You're welcome my dear friend. Always glad to feed the trolls, that woefully endangered species\nIn this option, the speaker uses the term \"trolls\" instead of elephants. The use of \"trolls\" in this context is likely a metaphor for people who engage in online harassment or disruptive behavior. The speaker seems to be expressing a negative sentiment towards these individuals, while appearing to be happy to \"feed\" them. This option contains sarcasm, as the speaker likely does not genuinely feel happy about interacting with such people.\n\nAnswer: (B) You're welcome my dear friend.
