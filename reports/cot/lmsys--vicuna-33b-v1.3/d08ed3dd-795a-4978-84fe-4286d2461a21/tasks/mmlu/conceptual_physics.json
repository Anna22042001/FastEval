            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the principles of general relativity. General relativity is a theory in physics that explains how gravity works by considering the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\nThis option is not correct. According to general relativity, light follows the curvature of spacetime, but it doesn't experience a force like objects with mass.\n\n(B) light passing the Sun is deflected.\nThis option is correct. General relativity predicts that light will follow the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun's mass, which results in the deflection of light from a straight path. This effect is known as gravitational lensing.\n\n(C) a clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth.\nThis option is not correct. According to general relativity, time dilation depends on the relative speed and gravity of an object, not just gravity alone. A clock on the Sun's surface would experience time dilation due to its high speed of rotation, but it wouldn't be solely because of gravity.\n\nGiven the reasoning above, the answer is:\n\n(B) light passing the Sun is deflected.",

Beta particles are high-energy electrons or positrons emitted by the nucleus of an atom during radioactive decay.\n2. There are two types of beta decay: beta minus (\u03b2-) and beta plus (\u03b2+).\n3. In beta minus decay, a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron, and an electron antineutrino. The atomic number increases by 1, and the mass number increases by 1.\n4. In beta plus decay, a proton in the nucleus decays into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. The atomic number reduces by 1, and the mass number remains the same.\n\nNow, let's apply this knowledge to the given question:\n\nWhen an element ejects a beta particle, the atomic number of that element\n\n(A) reduces by 1\n(B) increases by 1\n(C) reduces by 2\n(D) increases by 2\n\nSince beta plus decay results in the atomic number reducing by 1, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) increases by 1",

The direction of the current is such that it creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in the original magnetic field.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) current: Changing the magnetic field in a loop of wire can indeed create a current in the loop, as described by Faraday's law of induction.\n(B) voltage: Voltage is not directly created by changing the magnetic field in a loop of wire. It is related to the potential difference between two points in an electric field.\n(C) electric field: Changing the magnetic field in a loop of wire does not directly create an electric field. Electric fields are generated by electric charges or time-varying magnetic fields.\n(D) All of these: While it is tempting to choose this option since a current is created, it is not correct because voltage is not directly created by changing the magnetic field in a loop of wire.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) current",

In the subtractive color model (used for paint and ink), the primary colors are red, blue, and yellow.\n3. Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors. In the subtractive color model, the secondary colors are green, orange, and purple.\n4. Complementary colors are pairs of colors that are located opposite each other on the color wheel.

The human eye contains photoreceptor cells called cones and rods. Cones are responsible for color vision, while rods help us see in low-light conditions.\n2. Cones come in three types: red, green, and blue (also referred to as RGB). These three types of cones are responsible for our ability to perceive various colors.\n3. When you look at a rose, the red petals reflect a specific wavelength of light. This light enters your eye and is absorbed by the red cones.\n4. The red cones then send a signal to your brain, which interprets the signal as the color red.\n\nNow, let's apply this knowledge to the given options:\n\n(A) red: This option is incorrect because we're looking at the red petals, not emitting red light.\n(B) green: This option is incorrect because green cones are responsible for perceiving the color green, not emitting it.\n(C) white minus red: This option is incorrect because white light contains all colors of the spectrum, including red.

If an aircraft breaks the sound barrier, it will create a sonic boom.\n\n(B) Pulling out of a subsonic dive: A subsonic dive refers to an aircraft traveling below the speed of sound. If an aircraft is pulling out of a subsonic dive, it is accelerating and may eventually reach supersonic speeds, which would then create a sonic boom.\n\n(C) Flying faster than sound: If an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound, it will create a sonic boom.\n\n(D) Each of these produces a sonic boom: This option is correct.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process of fusion and the energy released in the form of different types of radiation.\n\nFusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus and release energy. In the case of hydrogen isotopes, the fusion of deuterium (D) and tritium (T) produces a helium nucleus (alpha particle) and a neutron. The reaction can be represented as:\n\nD + T -> He + n\n\nNow, let's consider the different types of energy that can be released in this reaction:\n\n1. Gamma radiation: High-energy photons that are emitted during nuclear reactions, such as fusion, can carry a significant amount of energy. However, in the D-T fusion reaction, gamma radiation is not the primary mode of energy release.\n2. Kinetic energy of the alpha particle: Alpha particles are helium nuclei, which are quite massive compared to other particles like protons or electrons. When an alpha particle is produced in a fusion reaction, it will have kinetic energy. However, the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is not the primary mode of energy release in the D-T fusion reaction either.\n3. Kinetic energy of the neutron: Neutrons are also produced in the D-T fusion reaction, and they can have kinetic energy depending on the energy of the reaction. Neutrons can carry a significant amount of energy, but their energy is not directly related to the fusion reaction's energy output.\n\nThe primary mode of energy release in the D-T fusion reaction is in the form of kinetic energy of the products (alpha particles and neutrons). The energy is not distributed equally among the different modes of energy release, but rather, most of the energy is in the form of kinetic energy of the products.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) All of these about equally.",

A satellite in a circular orbit is moving at a constant speed, which is fast enough to counteract the force of gravity and keep it in a stable orbit.\n\nNow, we need to consider the direction of the gravitational force. Since the satellite is in a circular orbit, the force must be directed towards the center of the Earth along the satellite's radial direction.
