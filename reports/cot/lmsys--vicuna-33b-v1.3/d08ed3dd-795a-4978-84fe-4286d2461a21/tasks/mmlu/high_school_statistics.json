Which of the following is the most appropriate statement?\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155.\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.",

            "model_answer": "First, let's identify what information is given and what we need to find.\n\nGiven:\n\n* Average donation: $155\n* Standard deviation: $32\n\nWe need to find the most appropriate statement about the donations.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155.\nThis statement is true based on the given information.\n\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\nTo find the value for which 50% of donations are more than, we can use the standard deviation. We can find the z-score first by subtracting the average from the standard deviation: ($155 - $32) / $32 = 4. This gives us a z-score of 4. Now, we can find the value corresponding to this z-score using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The value is approximately $187. So, 50% of donations are more than $187. This statement is not true.\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\nTo find the confidence interval, we can use the standard error, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (100). The standard error for the given data is approximately $32 / sqrt(100) = $4. Now, we can find the z-scores for the confidence interval. For a 95% confidence interval, the z-scores are -2.576 and 2.576. We can then add and subtract these z-scores from the average donation to find the confidence interval: ($155 + 2.576) and ($155 - 2.576) = ($157.576 and $152.424). Converting these to whole numbers, we get approximately $158 and $152. So, the statement is approximately correct, but with slightly different numbers.\n\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\nTo find the z-scores for the confidence interval, we can use the standard error, which is approximately $4. For a 95% confidence interval, the z-scores are -2.576 and 2.576. We can then add and subtract these z-scores from the average donation to find the confidence interval: ($155 + 2.576) and ($155 - 2.576) = ($157.576 and $152.424). Converting these to whole numbers, we get approximately $158 and $152. This statement is correct.\n\nSo, the most appropriate statement is:\n\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.",

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider what each of these statistics represents and which one would be most beneficial for the teachers' union to quote during negotiations.\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries: The mean is the average of the salaries, and it is calculated by adding up all the salaries and dividing by the number of salaries. If the district has a few highly paid administrators, the mean could be skewed upwards, which might not accurately represent the typical salary of a teacher.\n\n(B) The mode of all the salaries: The mode is the salary that appears most frequently in the data. If there are many teachers with similar salaries and a few administrators with much higher salaries, the mode could be a more representative figure for the typical teacher's salary.\n\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries: The standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the mean. It doesn't provide a direct representation of the typical salary, and it might not be the most effective statistic to quote during negotiations.\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries: The median is the middle value in the data when the salaries are sorted in ascending order. If there are a few highly paid administrators, the median could be a more accurate representation of the typical teacher's salary, as it would not be influenced by extreme values.\n\nGiven this analysis, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations.\n\nAnswer: (D) The median of all the salaries.",

The expected value for each cell should be at least 5 to ensure that the chi-squared distribution is a good approximation to the binomial distribution. This is known as the \"chi-squared approximation\" and is important for the validity of the test.\n\nStatement II: In order to use \u03c72 procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom.\n\nDegrees of freedom (df) represent the number of independent pieces of information needed to estimate the parameters of a statistical distribution. In the case of \u03c72 procedures, the df are related to the number of categories in the table. For a one-way table, the df is equal to the number of categories minus one (df = k - 1), and for a two-way table, the df is the product of the number of categories in each dimension minus the number of rows (df = (k-1)(l-1)). Therefore, you must have at least 2 df to use \u03c72 procedures.\n\nStatement III: In a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3.\n\nIn a 4 \u00d7 2 two-way table, there are 4 categories in the first dimension and 2 categories in the second dimension. To calculate the df, we subtract the number of rows (which is the minimum of the two dimensions): df = (4-1)(2-1) = 3.\n\nNow, let's determine which statements are true:\n\n(A) I only: False, since the expected value requirement is only a guideline for the chi-squared approximation, and the test can still be used even if the expected value is less than 5.\n\n(B) I and II only: False, since II is not entirely correct. You need at least 1 df to use \u03c72 procedures, not 2.\n\n(C) I and II only: False, for the same reason as above.\n\n(D) III only: True, as the reasoning for Statement III is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

In this case, we have two locations, and we're comparing the mean sales revenue per salesperson at each location.\n\n1. The samples are independent: Since the manager took a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently, it is reasonable to assume that the samples are independent.\n2. The samples are randomly selected: The manager randomly selected 10 salespeople from each location, so it is reasonable to assume that the samples are randomly selected.\n3. The samples are normally distributed: For a t-test to be valid, it is assumed that the population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed. This assumption is crucial for the validity of the t-test.\n4. The population variances are equal or unknown: The t-test is based on the assumption that the population standard deviations at both locations are equal. If the population standard deviations are not equal, we can still use the t-test, but we need to use the Welch's t-test, which is a variation of the t-test that does not require equal population variances.\n\nBased on the given options and the reasoning above, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.",
