This doesn't seem to be a legitimate form of community, so it's the one that doesn't fit the list.\n\n(D) virtual communities: These are indeed a form of community that exists only in cyberspace, such as online forums or social media groups.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) sociological communities",

This does not directly address the adoption of middle class values by the affluent working class.\n\n(B) This option aligns with the embourgeoisement thesis, as it suggests the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life.\n\n(C) This option discusses the 'deskilling' of white collar occupations due to new technologies. While it may have an impact on the workforce, it does not directly address the adoption of middle class values by the affluent working class.\n\n(D) This option states that the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes.

The \"new men\" concept emerged in the late 20th century, and it signified a shift in men's attitudes towards household chores and childcare.\n\n(B) Their wives were at home and nagged them all the time - This option does not align with the context of the study, as it suggests a negative connotation and does not focus on the changing roles of men.\n\n(C) Exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented - This option is not relevant to the study, as it focuses on the invention of household appliances rather than the changing roles of men in the household.\n\n(D) They were unemployed or both partners worked full time - This option is not the best fit, as it does not address the main topic of the study, which is the changing roles of men in the household and their participation in domestic chores.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

Covert participant observation is a research method where the researcher joins a group or organization and blends in without revealing their true intentions, which is to observe and gather data about the group's behavior, interactions, and practices.\n2. The main ethical issue with this method is that it involves deception, which goes against the principle of informed consent. Informed consent is a fundamental ethical principle in research, requiring that participants understand the purpose, procedures, risks, and benefits of the study before they agree to participate.\n3. By not disclosing the true purpose of the research, covert participant observation violates the principle of informed consent and may lead to potential harm or distress to the participants, as they are unaware of the researcher's intentions and the possible consequences of their actions.\n4. The other options - not being able to write comprehensive fieldnotes or record conversations, observing people outside of their natural setting, and subjecting the participants to physical harm - are not the main ethical problem with covert participant observation, as they may also arise in other research methods and are not specific to this particular method.",
