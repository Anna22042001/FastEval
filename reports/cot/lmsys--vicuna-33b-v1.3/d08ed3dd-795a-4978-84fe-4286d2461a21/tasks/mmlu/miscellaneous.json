            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the population of the United States and the average number of movies watched by each person in a year.\n\n1. Determine the population of the United States.\n2. Estimate the average number of movies watched by each person in a year.\n3. Multiply the population by the average number of movies watched to get the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year.\n\nLet's start by finding the population of the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, the estimated population in 2021 was around 331.8 million.\n\nNext, we need to estimate the average number of movies watched by each person in a year. A rough estimate could be 10 movies per person per year, considering both cinema and home viewing.\n\nNow, we multiply the population (331.8 million) by the average number of movies watched per person per year (10). This gives us a total of approximately 3,318,000,000 movies watched in homes in the United States in one year.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) 20,000,000,000",

The task should be related to comparing quantities, not just counting or organizing apples.\n2. The task should be simple enough for prekindergarten students to understand.\n3. The task should involve the concept of equal quantities or comparing differences in quantities.\n4. The task should be engaging and use the apples as a hands-on learning tool.\n\nAfter considering these factors, the best option is (D) having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the amount of energy Americans waste by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks. We can approach this problem by first estimating the total amount of ice used and then calculating the energy needed to produce that ice. Finally, we can determine the energy wasted by considering the amount of ice thrown out.\n\n1. Estimate the total amount of ice used by Americans in a year.\n2. Calculate the energy needed to produce that amount of ice.\n3. Estimate the amount of ice thrown out and the energy wasted in doing so.\n\nLet's start by estimating the total amount of ice used by Americans in a year.\n\n1. First, let's estimate the number of Americans who consume ice in their drinks. We can assume that it's a significant portion of the population, say 80% or 0.8 million people.\n2. Next, let's estimate the average daily ice consumption per person. We can assume that each person consumes 1 kg of ice per day.\n3. Now, we can calculate the total daily ice consumption by multiplying the number of people consuming ice by the average daily ice consumption per person.\n4. Finally, we can find the total yearly ice consumption by multiplying the total daily ice consumption by the number of days in a year (365 days).\n\nNow that we have an estimate of the total yearly ice consumption, we can calculate the energy needed to produce that amount of ice.\n\n1. Ice production requires energy to cool the water and to operate the ice-making machinery. Let's assume that it takes 1 kWh (kilowatt-hour) of energy to produce 1 kg of ice.\n2. We can now calculate the total energy needed to produce the yearly ice consumption by multiplying the total yearly ice consumption by the energy needed per kg of ice.\n\nFinally, we need to estimate the amount of ice thrown out and the energy wasted in doing so.\n\n1. Let's assume that 25% of the ice used is thrown out unused.\n2. We can now calculate the amount of ice thrown out by multiplying the total yearly ice consumption by the percentage of ice thrown out.\n3. Finally, we can estimate the energy wasted by multiplying the energy needed to produce the thrown-out ice by the amount of thrown-out ice.\n\nNow that we have calculated the energy wasted, we can find the answer to the question.\n\n(A) 6*10^8 J",
