            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the purpose of next generation sequencing (NGS) and how it is commonly used in various fields.\n\nNext generation sequencing is a technology that allows for rapid and high-throughput sequencing of DNA. It has revolutionized genomics and various other fields by enabling the sequencing of entire genomes quickly and cost-effectively.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) To identify a newly discovered virus: NGS can be used to identify new viruses, but this is not the most common application of the technology.\n\n(B) To search for drug resistant mutants: NGS can be used to identify drug resistant mutants, but this is also not the most common application of the technology.\n\n(C) To identify quasi species viruses: This option is not well-defined, and it is unclear what \"quasi species viruses\" means.\n\n(D) Cannot be used: This option is incorrect, as NGS is a widely used and valuable technology.\n\nGiven the options, it seems that the most common use of NGS is not represented. However, a common use of NGS is in genomics and transcriptomics research, where it is used to sequence entire genomes or transcriptomes to study gene expression, genetic variation, and other genomic features.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(E) Genomics and transcriptomics research",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the purpose of randomization in a clinical trial and how it helps control for various biases and confounders.\n\nRandomization is a process used in clinical trials to assign participants to either the experimental or control group. It helps ensure that the groups are comparable, reducing the potential for biases and confounders to affect the study results.\n\nNow, let's analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) Placebo effect: The placebo effect is a phenomenon where patients experience improvements in symptoms simply due to the belief that they are receiving an active treatment. Randomization helps control for the placebo effect by distributing participants equally between the experimental and control groups, making it less likely that one group will experience a significant placebo effect.\n\n(B) Recall bias: Recall bias occurs when participants' memories of past events are influenced by their knowledge of the study's outcome. Randomization does not directly control for recall bias, as it is a type of information bias rather than a confounder related to group assignment.\n\n(C) Non-compliance: Non-compliance refers to participants not following the study protocol, such as not taking medications as prescribed. Randomization helps control for non-compliance by ensuring that both groups have a similar proportion of compliant and non-compliant participants, reducing the impact of non-compliance on the study results.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction): Effect modification, also known as interaction, occurs when the effect of an intervention varies depending on the presence or absence of a specific factor. Randomization helps control for effect modification by distributing participants with different factors equally between the groups, increasing the chance of detecting an interaction if it exists.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction)",
