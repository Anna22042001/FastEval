            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of international legal personality and how it applies to different entities, including individuals.\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the ability of an entity to possess certain rights and duties under international law, and to be able to exercise or enforce those rights and duties.\n\nStates and international organizations are generally considered to have full international legal personality, meaning they can exercise all the rights and duties available under international law.\n\nNow, let's consider individuals (physical persons). In general, they do not enjoy the same level of international legal personality as States and international organizations. However, there are certain situations in which individuals may be granted limited international legal personality.\n\nFor example, individuals can sometimes bring claims before international courts, such as the International Court of Justice or regional human rights courts. In these cases, individuals may be granted limited international legal personality for the specific purpose of bringing a claim.\n\nMoreover, individuals can also be parties to international agreements, such as treaties or contracts, and may have certain rights and obligations under those agreements.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of collective rights and how they differ from individual rights.\n\n1. First, let's define individual rights, which are rights that are inherent to each person, regardless of their group membership. These rights are often protected by law and are crucial for the protection of human dignity and freedom.\n2. Now, let's define collective rights. These are rights that are held by a group of people, rather than by individual members of the group. These rights can include the right to cultural expression, the right to political representation, and the right to maintain a distinct way of life.\n3. Option (A) is incorrect because collective rights are not limited to distinct groups of people, but can apply to any group that shares a common identity or interest.\n4. Option (B) is also incorrect because it suggests that collective rights are only those that belong to the group as a whole and not to individual members, which is not always the case. Some collective rights may also extend to individual members of the group.\n5. Option (C) is incorrect because minority rights are not the same as collective rights. Minority rights refer to the specific rights and protections that are afforded to minority groups within a larger society, which can include both individual and collective rights.\n6. Option (D) is the correct answer because it captures the essence of collective rights. Collective rights entail a right of the group as a whole, as well as individual rights of the group's members. This means that the group has certain rights that are distinct from the rights of individual members, but individual members may also have rights within the context of the group.\n\n(D)",

This option does not accurately describe monism, as it suggests a hierarchical relationship between international and domestic law that is not consistent with the monist perspective.\n\nOption (B) states that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. This option accurately describes the monist approach, as monism posits that there is no fundamental distinction between international and domestic law, and they are both part of a unified legal system.\n\nOption (C) states that domestic laws are superior to international law. This option does not accurately describe monism, as it suggests a hierarchical relationship between international and domestic law that is not consistent with the monist perspective.\n\nOption (D) states that domestic and international law never clash. This option is not accurate, as it implies that there can never be any conflicts between domestic and international law, which is not the case in reality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order",

This principle suggests that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be interpreted in a way that adapts to the evolving social, economic, and cultural circumstances of the time. In other words, the Court should take into account the changing values and standards in European society when deciding cases.\n\nNext, let's briefly examine the cases mentioned:\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978): This case deals with the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. It does not directly address the living instrument principle.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009): This case involves the right to respect for private and family life, and the potential for a clash between this right and the need to protect public health. The ECtHR emphasized the importance of the living instrument principle in this case, as it considered the evolving nature of public health and medical science.\n\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002): This case focuses on the right to respect for private life and the recognition of same-sex relationships. The ECtHR did not explicitly mention the living instrument principle in this case, but it did emphasize the importance of evolving social norms and values in interpreting the Convention.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998): This case deals with the right to life and the state's obligation to protect individuals from threats by private individuals.

This is not entirely accurate, as the doctrine of incorporation doesn't necessarily require a legislative transformation.\n\n(B) This option states that the doctrine of incorporation doesn't require any further action at the domestic level.

The case revolves around the question of whether the EU can implement UNSC resolutions without any further implementing legislation, and if these resolutions should be construed in accordance with human rights.\n3. The ECJ ruled that UNSC resolutions must be incorporated into EU law, but they cannot be directly applied. Instead, they must be transposed into EU law through legislation or other legal acts.\n4.
