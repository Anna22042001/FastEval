            "model_answer": "To determine which one of the following is not a key management skill in planning, we can analyze each option:\n\n(A) Conceptual skills: These skills involve the ability to think abstractly and understand complex ideas. They are important for planning because they allow managers to visualize the big picture and develop strategies.\n(B) Analytical skills: These skills involve the ability to break down complex problems into smaller components and analyze them systematically. They are crucial for planning because they enable managers to make informed decisions based on data and evidence.\n(C) IT and computing skills: While these skills may be useful for managing technology and automating certain aspects of planning, they are not as essential as the other skills for the overall planning process.\n(D) Communication skills: These skills involve the ability to express ideas clearly and effectively, as well as to listen and understand others. They are critical for planning because they allow managers to coordinate with others, share information, and persuade stakeholders.\n\nBased on the analysis, (C) IT and computing skills are not a key management skill in planning.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the different types of cultures and their characteristics. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the types of cultures:\n\t* Team culture: Emphasizes individual performance and competitiveness.\n\t* Collaborative culture: Encourages cooperation and shared decision-making.\n\t* Group culture: Focuses on maintaining stability and avoiding conflict.\n\t* Collective culture: Stresses the importance of shared values and goals.\n2. Analyze the question:\n\t* The question asks about workers' acceptance of change in the context of a specific type of culture.\n\t* To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the type of culture where workers are more likely to accept change.\n3. Evaluate the options:\n\t* A) Team culture: Workers in a team culture may resist change if it disrupts individual performance or competitiveness.\n\t* B) Collaborative culture: Workers in a collaborative culture are more likely to accept change, as they are already accustomed to cooperating and sharing decision-making.\n\t* C) Group culture: Workers in a group culture might resist change due to the focus on stability and avoiding conflict.\n\t* D) Collective culture: Workers in a collective culture may accept change if it aligns with shared values and goals, but they may also resist change if it goes against these values.\n4. Conclude the answer:\n\t* Based on the analysis, the most likely type of culture where workers are more likely to accept change is a collaborative culture (B).\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Collaborative culture",

A CSR framework is a set of principles and practices that a company follows to ensure it is managing its social, economic, and environmental impacts on society.\n\n(A) Retaining the status quo is not a characteristic of a CSR framework because CSR is about proactively addressing and managing a company's impacts on society, not maintaining the current state of affairs.\n(B) Understanding society is indeed a characteristic of a CSR framework, as it involves understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and investors.\n(C) Harnessing diversity is not a characteristic of a CSR framework, although it may be a positive outcome of a well-implemented CSR strategy. CSR is about managing a company's impacts on society, not about diversity within the company itself.\n(D) Building capacity is not a characteristic of a CSR framework. While it may be a result of implementing CSR initiatives, building capacity (i.e., developing the skills and knowledge of employees) is not the primary goal of a CSR framework.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

This option seems most relevant to the question.\n\n(C) Adam Smith: Smith is known as the \"Father of Economics\" and is associated with the concept of the \"invisible hand\" in free market economies. His work is related to economics and market systems, not bureaucratic structures.\n\n(D) Mary Parker Follett: Follett was a management consultant and author who focused on organizational theory and human relations.

An acquisition typically occurs when one company (the acquirer) purchases another company (the target). The acquirer usually obtains control of the target, and the target often ceases to exist as a separate entity.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Two equal partners decide to work together: This option doesn't involve any acquisition, as both partners are equal and there is no purchase of one company by another.\n\n(B) Two equal partners share resources: This option also doesn't involve an acquisition, as the partners are simply sharing resources rather than one company acquiring another.\n\n(C) Two unequal partners join together: This option could potentially involve an acquisition if the larger or more powerful partner acquires the smaller or weaker partner.\n\n(D) Two unequal partners become one after a buyout: This option clearly describes an acquisition, as one partner (the acquirer) purchases the other partner (the target), and they become one entity after the buyout.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.",
