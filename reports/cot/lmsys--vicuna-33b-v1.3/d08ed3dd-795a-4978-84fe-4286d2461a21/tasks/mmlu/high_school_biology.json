            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the components of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and their functions.\n\n1. Polymerase: A DNA polymerase is required to synthesize new DNA strands by adding nucleotides to the growing chain.\n2. Template DNA: A DNA sample containing the target DNA sequence is needed as a template for the synthesis process.\n3. Primers: Short, single-stranded DNA molecules complementary to the target sequence are used to initiate DNA synthesis.\n4. Nucleotides: These are the building blocks (dNTPs) for the synthesis of new DNA strands.\n5. Buffer: A buffer is used to maintain a stable pH during the reaction.\n6. Thermal cycler: A device that provides temperature control for the various steps of PCR (denaturation, annealing, and extension).\n\nNow, let's check each option against these requirements:\n\n(A) Reverse transcriptase: This enzyme is used for reverse transcription, which is not required in a standard PCR. It is used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA templates. (Incorrect)\n\n(B) A vacuum chamber: A vacuum chamber is not required for PCR. (Incorrect)\n\n(C) Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA: Primers are essential in PCR to initiate DNA synthesis. (Correct)\n\n(D) DNA ligase: DNA ligase is used to join DNA fragments in molecular cloning or DNA repair, but it is not required for PCR. (Incorrect)\n\n(E) None of the above: While some of the options mention necessary components for other molecular biology techniques, none of them are required for a standard PCR. (Incorrect)\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA",

It only describes the location of replication.\n\n(B) RNA viruses replicate much faster than DNA viruses.\nFaster replication could potentially increase the chance of errors, but it does not directly explain why RNA viral replication is more susceptible to mutations compared to DNA viral replication.\n\n(C) RNA viruses use uracil instead of thymine.\nUsing uracil instead of thymine is a characteristic of RNA, but it does not directly relate to the susceptibility to mutations.\n\n(D) RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.\nThis option explains that RNA replication does not have the proofreading functions found in DNA replication, which could lead to a higher chance of mutations. This seems to be the most relevant explanation.\n\nReasoning: Option (D) is the most plausible explanation, as it addresses the lack of proofreading functions in RNA replication, which could lead to a higher susceptibility to mutations compared to DNA viral replication.\n\nAnswer: (D) RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which term best describes the fossil evidence of horses gradually increasing in size over geologic time, we need to consider the different types of selection:\n\n1. Artificial selection: This occurs when humans intentionally select specific traits in organisms for breeding, often resulting in new varieties or species. This does not apply to the natural process of horse evolution.\n2. Directional selection: This occurs when a specific trait is favored by environmental pressures, causing a population to change in a specific direction over time. If the larger size of horses provided a significant advantage, this could explain the increase in size.\n3. Stabilizing selection: This occurs when a population tends to revert to a stable mean value, with traits at the extremes being selected against. This does not seem to apply to the case of horses, as their size has gradually increased.\n4. Disruptive selection: This occurs when two extreme traits are favored, causing a population to split into two distinct groups. This does not seem to apply to the case of horses, as their size has gradually increased without a clear split into distinct groups.\n\nAfter considering these options, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) directional selection",

However, enhancers are not found in prokaryotes, which is why option (A) is not the correct answer.\n2. Repressor: A repressor is a protein that binds to the operator region of a gene, preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and transcribing the gene.

Operator: The operator is the DNA sequence to which the repressor binds, preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter.\n4.

Artificial selection is the process by which humans selectively breed organisms to emphasize desired traits. This process is used in cattle breeding to improve the quality of meat.\n2. Directional selection is a process where one extreme of a trait is favored, causing a shift in the population's distribution over time. This process may not be the primary one used in cattle breeding, as it doesn't directly mention improving meat quality.\n3.

The main purpose of crossing-over is to exchange genetic material between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes.\n3. This process results in the formation of recombinant chromosomes, which contributes to genetic diversity in offspring.\n4.
