            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. When the environmental temperature increases, the body's temperature also rises.\n2. To maintain a stable internal temperature, the body needs to dissipate the excess heat.\n3. The body can do this through various mechanisms, including evaporation, radiation, and conduction.\n4. Evaporation is a key mechanism, as it involves the loss of water and heat through the skin.\n5. Thus, the body will increase the amount of water lost through the skin to compensate for the increased environmental temperature.\n\nBased on my reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) increasing water lost through skin",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the main processes that occur to lactate once it leaves muscle and enters the circulation. Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Lactate is produced in muscle cells during anaerobic respiration or when the demand for energy is high.\n2. Lactate leaves muscle cells and enters the circulation (bloodstream).\n3. The main fate of lactate in the circulation depends on the body's energy needs and the availability of oxygen.\n4. If oxygen is available, lactate can be transported to other tissues, such as heart and brain, where it can be oxidized to produce energy.\n5. If oxygen is not readily available, lactate can be converted to other substances, such as glucose or urea.\n6. The conversion of lactate to glucose is known as gluconeogenesis and primarily occurs in the liver.\n7. The conversion of lactate to urea is a process called the urea cycle, which also takes place in the liver.\n8. Excretion of lactate via the kidneys is a minor pathway compared to the other fates mentioned above.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) conversion to glucose in the heart.",

Transcription is the process by which the information in a DNA molecule is copied into a molecule of RNA. There are two main types of RNA produced during transcription: messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). mRNA is responsible for carrying the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosomes, where it is used to synthesize proteins.\n\nSo, the transcription of DNA to mRNA occurs before it can be used to make proteins. This process happens in the nucleus, where the DNA is located.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) in the nucleus.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the composition of DNA and how it relates to the given options.\n\n1. DNA is a double-stranded molecule that stores genetic information.\n2. Purines and pyrimidines are two types of nitrogenous bases found in DNA.\n3. There are four main purines and pyrimidines in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C).\n4. The DNA molecule is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between purines and pyrimidines on opposite strands. Adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) variable: This option is incorrect because, while the exact ratio can vary between organisms, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a given organism is consistent within its DNA.\n(B) determined by the base sequence in RNA: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is not determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n(C) genetically determined: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is not determined by an organism's genes.\n(D) always 1:1: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is not always 1:1.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, we can conclude that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded molecule of DNA is not (A) variable, (B) determined by the base sequence in RNA, (C) genetically determined, or (D) always 1:1. Instead, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is consistent within a given organism, and the specific ratio depends on the organism.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(E) consistent within a given organism.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process that occurs in a cell when oxygen is no longer supplied. When oxygen is not available, the cell switches to anaerobic respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen. This process is less efficient than aerobic respiration and produces less energy in the form of ATP.\n\nThe process of anaerobic respiration involves a series of reactions, including the breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted into lactate or ethanol, depending on the organism. The reactions involved in anaerobic respiration are:\n\n1. Glycolysis: The breakdown of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, producing a net gain of 2 ATP molecules.\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation (also called the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle): This step is skipped in the absence of oxygen, as it involves the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and then into citric acid, which would further generate ATP, FADH2, and NADH.\n3. Electron transport chain (ETC): This step also requires oxygen, as it involves the generation of ATP from the energy stored in electron carriers (NADH and FADH2).\n\nGiven this information, we can determine which molecule will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. Glycolysis will still occur, as it is the first step in breaking down glucose and does not require oxygen.\n2. Pyruvate decarboxylation and the electron transport chain will not occur, as they require oxygen.\n3. Since pyruvate decarboxylation does not occur, pyruvate will start to accumulate in the cell.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Pyruvate",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the physiological aspects of lactate concentration during intense physical activity, such as soccer.\n\n1. Lactate is a byproduct of anaerobic glycolysis, which is the breakdown of glucose to produce energy in the absence of oxygen.\n2. During intense exercise, the body's demand for energy can exceed the ability of the cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen to the working muscles. As a result, anaerobic glycolysis is activated to produce energy faster than aerobic metabolism.\n3. The lactate produced during anaerobic glycolysis is then used by other muscles and organs as a source of energy or is converted back into glucose through the Cori cycle.\n4. As the game progresses, the players become more fatigued due to a combination of factors, such as the accumulation of metabolic byproducts (like lactate), decreased muscle glycogen stores, and reduced ability to remove heat from the body.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.",

There are three main energy systems in the body: the phosphagen system, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nThe phosphagen system is the fastest energy system and involves the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine. ATP is the main energy currency of the cell and is produced through the breakdown of phosphocreatine. This system can provide energy for very short, high-intensity activities, such as a single maximum effort like a sprint or a heavy lift.\n\nGlycolysis is the next energy system and involves the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP. This system can provide energy for moderate-intensity activities for a longer duration than the phosphagen system, typically up to around 2 minutes.\n\nOxidative phosphorylation is the slowest energy system and involves the breakdown of fatty acids and other molecules to produce ATP. This system can provide energy for low-intensity activities and can sustain energy production for long periods of time.\n\nGiven this information, we can determine that the phosphagen system is the most relevant energy system for sustaining maximal exertion exercise. The question states that the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about (A) 1-2 seconds, (B) 5-10 seconds, (C) 30-40 seconds, or (D) 50-60 seconds.\n\nSince the phosphagen system is the fastest energy system and can provide energy for very short, high-intensity activities, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 1-2 seconds.",
