We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze the given information and determine how the American rail system in the 19th century relates to it.\n\nThe passage talks about the future of America and its potential to manifest divine principles, establish a union of republics, and be governed by the law of brotherhood. It also mentions the floor of the temple as a hemisphere and the roof as the star-studded heavens.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient.\nThis option seems to be about the effect of the rail system on markets and production, which is not directly related to the passage's focus on the future of America and its principles.\n\n(B) The entire national system was planned before the first railway was constructed.\nThis option suggests that the entire rail system was planned before the first railway, which is not mentioned in the passage and doesn't seem to be relevant to the passage's focus on America's future and principles.\n\n(C) The development of the rails had little effect on the development of American industry.\nThis option implies that the rail system had little impact on the development of American industry, which doesn't align with the passage's optimistic view of America's future and the potential of the rail system to contribute to that future.\n\n(D) A more highly developed rail system gave the Confederacy a decided advantage in the Civil War.\nThis option suggests that the Confederacy had a significant advantage in the Civil War due to a more developed rail system. While the passage does not directly mention the Civil War, it does discuss the future of America and its potential to manifest divine principles. A more highly developed rail system could contribute to that future by promoting unity and efficiency, but it doesn't necessarily give the Confederacy an advantage in the Civil War.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, none of them seem to directly relate to the main ideas in the passage. However, the closest option to the passage's focus on America's future and the potential of the rail system is:\n\n(A) Government subsidy of the railroads enabled markets to expand and for production to become more efficient.\n\nAlthough this option doesn't perfectly capture the essence of the passage, it is the best choice among the given options.",
