            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning for choosing the correct answer is as follows:\n\n1. The enlightened self-interest model of CSR focuses on the idea that acting ethically and responsibly is in an organization's own best interest.\n2. This model suggests that organizations should consider the long-term consequences of their actions, including the impact on various stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and the environment.\n3. By adopting this approach, organizations can create value for themselves and for society as a whole, which is more sustainable than focusing solely on short-term profits.\n4. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) That it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way",

            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze the question. There are two main issues associated with \"______\" sizing. The first issue is \"______\", which is a key issue because employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant due to the information policy of the corporation. The second issue is \"______\", particularly the \"______\" package that employees receive when laid off.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can identify the following keywords:\n\n1. \"sizing\" - likely related to \"downsizing\" or \"rightsizing\"\n2. \"issue\" - we need to identify two issues related to sizing\n3. \"involvement\" - employees' right to know about redundancy\n4. \"autonomy\" - might be related to the company's decision-making process\n5. \"remuneration\" - could refer to compensation or benefits\n6. \"compensation\" - related to the package received when laid off\n7. \"benefit\" - might refer to the overall benefits employees receive\n\nNow, let's match the keywords with the provided options:\n\n(A) Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation\n(B) Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation\n(C) Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit\n(D) Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit\n\nOption (A) seems to be the best fit:\n\n1. \"Down\" - likely refers to downsizing, which is a form of sizing.\n2. \"Involvement\" - matches the keyword related to employees' right to know.\n3. \"Remuneration\" - can refer to both compensation and benefits, which are related to the second issue.\n4. \"Compensation\" - directly matches the keyword related to the package received when laid off.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation",
