            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each statement in terms of the ball's motion:\n\nI. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\nAt the highest point, the ball is momentarily motionless before it starts to fall back down. However, since air resistance is not negligible, the ball will have some initial downward velocity due to gravity, so the speed is not exactly zero. This statement is false.\n\nII. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nAt the highest point, the ball is momentarily at rest (ignoring air resistance). However, as it starts to fall back down, the acceleration due to gravity is acting on it, so the acceleration is not exactly zero. This statement is false.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nWhen a object is thrown upward, it slows down due to gravity and air resistance. When it reaches its highest point, it starts to fall back down, and since it has already slowed down, it has less distance to cover on the way back down. Therefore, it takes less time to fall back down than to rise up. This statement is true.\n\nNow, let's determine the correct answer:\n\n(A) I only\n(B) II only\n(C) I & II only\n(D) I & III only\n\nSince only statement III is true, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) I & III only",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To find the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B, we need to consider Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law states that the magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The proportionality constant is 1/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080), where \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nFirst, let's find the electric force on each particle due to the other particle. We have:\n\nForce on A due to B = k \\* |Q| \\* |2Q| / (4 m)^2\nForce on B due to A = k \\* |Q| \\* |Q| / (4 m)^2\n\nSince the forces are acting along the same direction, we can add them to find the total force on each particle:\n\nTotal force on A = Force on A due to B + Force on A due to B = 2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |2Q| / (4 m)^2\nTotal force on B = Force on B due to A + Force on B due to A = 2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |Q| / (4 m)^2\n\nNow, we want to find the ratio of the magnitudes of the total forces on A and B. We can do this by taking the ratio of the magnitudes of the charges:\n\nRatio = (|2Q| / |Q|) \\* (Total force on A / Total force on B)\n\nSince we are considering the ratio of the magnitudes of the forces, we can ignore the direction and take the square root of the ratio of the forces:\n\nRatio = (2 / 1) \\* (\u221a(2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |2Q| / (4 m)^2) / \u221a(2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |Q| / (4 m)^2))\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression:\n\nRatio = 2 \\* (\u221a(2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |2Q| / (4 m)^2) / \u221a(2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |Q| / (4 m)^2))\n\nThe 2 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nRatio = (\u221a(2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |2Q| / (4 m)^2) / \u221a(2 \\* k \\* |Q| \\* |Q| / (4 m)^2))\n\nThe k in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nRatio = (\u221a(|Q| \\* |2Q| / (4 m)^2) / \u221a(|Q| \\* |Q| / (4 m)^2))\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression further:\n\nRatio = (\u221a(2 \\* |Q|^2) / \u221a(|Q|^2))\n\nThe \u221a(|Q|^2) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n\nRatio = (\u221a(2 \\* |Q|^2) / 1)\n\nSince the magnitude of Q is given as 1, we can find the ratio:\n\nRatio = \u221a(2 \\* 1^2) / 1 = \u221a(2) / 1 = \u221a(2)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(D) 1:02",
