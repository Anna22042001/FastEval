            "question": "An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?\n\n(A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",

            "question": "An incumbent was running for re-election as the mayor of a city. During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\n(B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n(C) inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\n(D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "My reasoning for the answer:\n\n1. The television correspondent's testimony is about a statement made by the opponent during a campaign speech.\n2. To determine the admissibility of the testimony, we need to consider whether it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule.\n3. The most relevant exception to the hearsay rule in this situation is likely the \"excited utterance\" exception, which allows for the admission of statements made under the influence of strong emotion or excitement, and which are offered to show the state of mind of the person making the statement.\n4. However, we need to consider whether the television correspondent's testimony meets the requirements for the excited utterance exception:\na. Was the opponent's statement made under the influence of strong emotion or excitement?\nb. Is the statement offered to show the state of mind of the person making the statement (i.e., the opponent)?\nc. Is the television correspondent an appropriate witness to provide this testimony?\n5. If the statement was made in a calm and deliberate manner, it may not qualify as an excited utterance, and the testimony would likely be inadmissible.\n6. If the statement was made under the influence of strong emotion or excitement and is being offered to show the state of mind of the person making the statement, the testimony may be admissible.\n7. However, even if the statement is admissible, the television correspondent's testimony may still be inadmissible if the notebook entry is considered the best evidence of the statement.\n\nAnswer: (D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",

            "question": "At 1:00 a. m. one night, two police officers were driving past a tavern when they noticed a man vomiting outside. They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town. Realizing that the man was extremely intoxicated, they grabbed him and shoved him into their patrol car. They drove the man around in the police car for a few minutes and told him he had two choices. They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail. One of the officers then said, \"Does that mean you want us to drop you off at the city limits?\" The man replied, \"Yes. \" They then drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway. Moments later, the man staggered onto the street and was struck by a car driven by a motorist. He suffered multiple injuries. If the man asserts a claim against the police department based on negligence, he will most likely\n\n(A) recover, because the police should have realized it was dangerous to drop him off where they did.\n(B) recover, because the police knew that the man was intoxicated when they dropped him off.\n(C) not recover, because the man chose to be driven to the city limits.\n(D) not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.",

The officers drove him to the city limits and left him along a busy highway, which was a potentially dangerous location.\n5. The man was struck by a car shortly after being dropped off, suffering multiple injuries.\n\nBased on these facts, the man may have a negligence claim against the police department. The police should have considered the safety of the man when dropping him off, especially given his intoxicated state. They did not ensure that he was in a safe location before leaving him.\n\nHowever, the motorist's act of hitting the man was a supervening cause of his injuries. The police's negligence created a situation where the man was at risk, but the motorist's actions ultimately caused the injuries.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) not recover, because the motorist's act was a supervening cause of his injury.",
