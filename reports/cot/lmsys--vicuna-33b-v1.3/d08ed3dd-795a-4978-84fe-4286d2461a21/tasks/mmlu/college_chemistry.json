The energy levels are quantized, which means they can only have certain discrete values. The number of energy levels is related to the nuclear spin of the atom.\n\nThe atomic number of 55Mn is 55, which means there are 55 protons in the nucleus. To determine the number of energy levels, we need to consider the nuclear spin.\n\n1. Determine the nuclear spin: The nuclear spin is determined by the number of neutrons in the nucleus. For 55Mn, the atomic mass number is 55, so the number of neutrons is 55 - 55 = 0. Thus, the nuclear spin is 0.\n2. Apply the spin-orbit interaction: Since the nuclear spin is 0, there is no spin-orbit interaction to consider.\n3. Apply the pairing effect: The pairing effect is not significant for light nuclei like 55Mn.\n\nNow that we have considered the factors affecting the energy levels, we can count the number of energy levels:\n\n1. The nuclear spin can have two values: 0 or 1 (since it is a half-integer).\n2. The total angular momentum can have j values of 0, 1, and 2 (since the total nucleons are 55, which is an odd number).\n\nThus, the number of energy levels is 2 (nuclear spin values) \\* 3 (j values) = 6.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) 8",
