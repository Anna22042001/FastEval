            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of induction heating and how it works. Induction heating is a process where an electrical current is induced in a conducting material by a time-varying magnetic field. The energy from the magnetic field causes the conducting material to heat up due to resistance to the flow of the induced current.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) conducting but non-magnetic materials: This option is incorrect because induction heating requires a conducting material to work. Non-magnetic materials can be conductors (like copper) or insulators (like glass).\n\n(B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magentic materials: This option is incorrect because induction heating works best in conducting materials that are also magnetic. The magnetic properties of the material play a crucial role in the induction heating process.\n\n(C) insulating materials: This option is incorrect because induction heating requires a conducting material to work. Insulators do not conduct electricity and will not heat up through induction heating.\n\n(D) conducting and magnetic materials: This option is correct. Induction heating works by inducing a current in a conducting material, and the material's magnetic properties play a crucial role in the heating process.\n\nAnswer: (D) conducting and magnetic materials.",

A thyristor is a type of semiconductor device that can be used as a switch or a rectifier. It has four regions: cut-off, forward-active, reverse-active, and avalanche.\n2. The holding current is the minimum current required to keep the thyristor in the forward-active region. It is also known as the \"pinch-off\" current.\n3. The latching current is the minimum current required to trigger the thyristor into the avalanche region, where it will remain even if the input current is removed.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1.

When a voltage is applied across the diode, an electric field forms at the p-n junction due to the difference in the electron and hole concentrations.\n3.
