Residual non-normality refers to the distribution of the residuals not being normally distributed.

One way to address residual non-normality is to transform the dependent variable or the independent variables. This can help achieve a closer fit to the normal distribution.\n3.

We want to find a 95% two-sided confidence interval for this intercept term.\n\nThe standard error of the intercept can be calculated using the formula:\n\nStandard error = (1/n) \\* sqrt(SSReg/((n-2)*(1-R^2)))\n\nwhere n is the sample size, SSReg is the residual sum of squares, and R^2 is the coefficient of determination.\n\nHowever, we don't have the necessary information to calculate the standard error directly from the given data. Instead, we can use the output from the linear regression model to find the standard error.\n\nIn the output, we look for the \"Standard Errors\" section, which provides the standard errors for the intercept and the slope coefficients. For the intercept, the standard error is approximately 0.56.\n\nNow we can find the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval. Since we have a two-sided confidence interval, we can use the z-score with a significance level of 0.025 to find the margin of error. The z-score is 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval.\n\nLower bound = 2.54 - (1.96 \\* 0.56) = 2.54 - 1.11 \u2248 -0.57\nUpper bound = 2.54 + (1.96 \\* 0.56) = 2.54 + 1.11 \u2248 3.65\n\nNow we need to round the lower and upper bounds to whole numbers. We can do this by rounding down the lower bound and rounding up the upper bound.\n\nRounded lower bound = -0.57 \u2248 -1\nRounded upper bound = 3.65 \u2248 4\n\nThe most appropriate 95% two-sided confidence interval for the intercept term of the model is:\n\n(A) (-1,4)",

This suggests that heteroscedasticity refers to a situation where the dispersion or spread of the errors is not constant across different levels of the independent variables.\n5.
