This could be harmful to their health, especially if they have any pre-existing conditions that are negatively affected by caffeine.\n\nScenario 2: Handing a toilet brush to your brother to clean his teeth might seem unsanitary and unusual, but it is not inherently morally wrong. As long as the toilet brush is clean and your brother is aware of the situation, there is no harm being done.\n\nNow, let's apply the scenarios to the given options:\n\n(A) Wrong, Wrong - This option doesn't match the scenarios, as the second scenario is not morally wrong.\n(B) Wrong, Not wrong - This option doesn't match the scenarios, as the first scenario is morally wrong, not not wrong.\n(C) Not wrong, Wrong - This option matches the scenarios, as the first scenario is morally wrong, and the second scenario is not morally wrong.\n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong - This option doesn't match the scenarios, as both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nThe answer is (C) Not wrong, Wrong.",
