            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand each of the given theories of emotions:\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard: This theory suggests that emotions are triggered by the brain's thalamus, which sends signals to the cortex. The cortex then interprets these signals and creates an emotional response. In this case, Antoinette's initial fear is due to her brain interpreting the sudden appearance of people as a threat.\n\n(B) Schachter-Singer: This theory proposes that emotions are a result of two processes: cognitive labeling and physiological arousal. In Antoinette's situation, she first experiences physiological arousal (a racing heart) due to the sudden appearance of people. Then, she cognitively labels this arousal as happiness when she realizes it's a surprise party.\n\n(C) James-Lange: This theory states that emotions are created by the physiological responses to a stimulus. In Antoinette's case, her racing heart is the physiological response to the stimulus (the surprise party), and she interprets this as happiness.\n\n(D) Erikson-Balint: This theory suggests that emotions are a result of the interaction between the id, ego, and superego. It focuses on the psychodynamic aspects of emotions, which doesn't seem to apply to Antoinette's situation.\n\nBased on the given information, the Schachter-Singer theory (B) best explains Antoinette's experience.",

            "question": "All of the following are characteristic of physiological arousal EXCEPT\n\n(A) dilation of the pupils\n(B) increase in salivation\n(C) increase in perspiration\n(D) increase in secretion of stress hormones",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what physiological arousal is and what each of the given options represents.\n\nPhysiological arousal refers to the body's general state of alertness or activation, which can be influenced by various factors such as emotions, stress, or external stimuli. It is associated with the body's sympathetic nervous system and is often characterized by specific physiological responses.\n\nNow let's examine each of the given options:\n\n(A) Dilation of the pupils: This is a characteristic of physiological arousal. When the pupils dilate, it allows more light to enter the eye, which can help with focusing and perceiving the environment.\n\n(B) Increase in salivation: This is also a characteristic of physiological arousal. Increased salivation is a reflex response that can be triggered by various stimuli, such as food or the presence of potential mates.\n\n(C) Increase in perspiration: This is a characteristic of physiological arousal. Increased perspiration, or sweating, is a way for the body to regulate its temperature during periods of heightened activity or stress.\n\n(D) Increase in secretion of stress hormones: This option is not a characteristic of physiological arousal. Stress hormones, such as cortisol, are released in response to stressful situations or perceived threats. While physiological arousal can be influenced by stress, the secretion of stress hormones is specifically related to the body's stress response, not general arousal.\n\nNow, let's summarize the reasoning:\n\n* Dilation of the pupils and increase in salivation are both characteristics of physiological arousal.\n* Increase in perspiration is also a characteristic of physiological arousal.\n* Increase in secretion of stress hormones is not a characteristic of physiological arousal, but rather a part of the body's stress response.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) increase in secretion of stress hormones",

While it may touch upon behavioral aspects, it does not specifically focus on identifying the most pressing behavioral problem or the environmental factors affecting it.\n\n(B) Cognitive assessment: This type of assessment measures an individual's cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, problem-solving, and decision-making. Although cognitive processes can influence behavior, this assessment does not specifically target identifying and addressing the most pressing behavioral problem in relation to the environment.\n\n(C) Ecological assessment: This type of assessment examines the relationship between an individual's behavior and their environment. It takes into account various factors, such as cultural, social, and physical contexts. This assessment is specifically designed to identify the most pressing behavioral problem and possible ways to alleviate it by investigating the relationship between aspects of the individual's environment and behavior.\n\n(D) Curriculum-based assessment: This type of assessment evaluates an individual's academic performance and progress in relation to a specific curriculum.

It is not directly related to breathing or obesity.\n\n(B) Hypersomnia: This refers to excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. It is not specifically related to breathing issues or obesity either.\n\n(C) Insomnia: This is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting poor-quality sleep.

While this concept is related to psychology, it does not fit the scenario, as Brittany's behavior is not about attributing actions to someone's character.\n\n(C) The mere exposure effect: This option refers to the phenomenon where people develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. While this concept is related to psychology, it does not fit the scenario, as the mere exposure effect would not explain Brittany's feeling of obligation to donate.\n\n(D) The reciprocity norm: This option refers to the social norm that dictates that people should repay others in kind when they receive something from them.
