Therefore, the syllogism cannot be materially true, as the conclusion may not be supported by the premises.\n\n(B) might be materially true: If a syllogism is formally invalid, it is possible that the premises are true and the conclusion is false. In this case, the syllogism could still be materially true if the premises are true, even though the argument is logically flawed.\n\n(C) might be materially untrue: If a syllogism is formally invalid, it is also possible that the premises are false, making the syllogism materially untrue.\n\n(D) both B and C: Both options B and C are possible outcomes for a formally invalid syllogism, as it could be materially true or materially untrue depending on the truth value of the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) both B and C",
