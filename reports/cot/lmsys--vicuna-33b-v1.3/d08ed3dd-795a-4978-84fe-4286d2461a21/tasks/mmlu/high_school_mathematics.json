Since the GCD of two integers is the product of their greatest common divisors, we can find the GCD and then multiply it by both integers.\n\nThe GCD of 45 and the other integer (let's call it x) is 1 because they are positive and relatively prime.

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of angular displacement and its relationship with the initial and final directions. Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The skater is facing north when she starts spinning.\n2. She spins 2250 degrees to her right.\n3. When a person spins to the right, it's as if they are walking around a circle in the counterclockwise direction.\n4. To determine the direction she is facing after the spin, we need to find the angle that brings her back to the north direction.\n5. Since she spun 2250 degrees, we need to find an angle that, when added to the initial north direction, gives us a total of 2250 degrees.\n6. To do this, we can break down the problem into smaller angles. For example, we can think of the spin as a series of 360-degree turns.\n7. If she spun 2250 degrees, it's as if she spun 6.5 times around (2250 / 360).\n8. However, each time she spins around, she moves 1/6.5 of 360 degrees, which is approximately 552.64 degrees.\n9. After 6.5 spins, she will have spun a total of 6.5 \\* 552.64 degrees, which is approximately 3600 degrees.\n10. So, the remaining angle to reach 2250 degrees is 2250 - 3600 = -1350 degrees.\n11. To find the angle that, when added to the initial north direction, gives us -1350 degrees, we can consider the angle between north and west.\n12. The angle between north and west is 90 degrees (or 1/4 of a full circle).\n13. To find the number of full circles we need to spin to get to -1350 degrees, we can divide -1350 by 360.\n14. -1350 / 360 \u2248 -3.75\n15.

After 3.75 spins, she will have spun a total of 3.75 \\* 97.22 degrees, which is approximately 350 degrees.\n18. So, the remaining angle to reach -1350 degrees is -1350 - 350 = -1000 degrees.\n19.

After 2.78 spins, she will have spun a total of 2.78 \\* 133.33 degrees, which is approximately 370 degrees.\n26. So, the remaining angle to reach -1000 degrees is -1000 - 370 = -630 degrees.\n27.

The angle between north and west is 90 degrees (or 1/4 of a full circle).\n29.
