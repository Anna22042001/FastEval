However, it can also lead to overfitting if the model becomes too complex for the amount of available data.\n\n(B) The learning rate:\nThe learning rate controls the step size during optimization. A high learning rate may cause the model to overshoot the optimal weights, while a low learning rate may lead to slow convergence and underfitting.\n\n(C) The initial choice of weights:\nInitializing weights randomly can affect the model's ability to fit the training data. Poorly initialized weights may lead to underfitting or overfitting, depending on the specific initialization method.\n\n(D) The use of a constant-term unit input:\nIncluding a constant-term unit input can help prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model learns the mean of the input features. However, it may not have a significant impact on the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.\n\nBased on this analysis, the option that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting is:\n\n(A) The number of hidden nodes.",

To determine the relationship between these statements, we need to understand if the hardware used for training affects the size of the model or not.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements individually.\n\nStatement 1: Industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs. This statement suggests that CPUs are commonly used for training large neural networks.\n\nStatement 2: The ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters. This statement indicates that the ResNet-50 model is a large model with a significant number of parameters.\n\nStep 3: Combine the statements and determine the relationship.\n\nConsidering that industrial-scale neural networks are trained on CPUs and the ResNet-50 model has a large number of parameters, it is plausible that the ResNet-50 model could be trained on CPUs. However, it is also worth noting that GPUs are more efficient for training neural networks due to their parallel processing capabilities. So, while it is possible to train the ResNet-50 model on CPUs, it might not be the most efficient choice.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer based on the analysis.\n\n(C) True, False\n\nExplanation: Statement 1 is true, as industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs.
