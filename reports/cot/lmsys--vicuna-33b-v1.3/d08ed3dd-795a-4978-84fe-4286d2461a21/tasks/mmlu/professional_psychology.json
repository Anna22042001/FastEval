            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the context of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the groups of people they may prioritize in their research.\n\nFirst, we should consider the mission of the APA. The APA is focused on advancing the creation, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives.\n\nNext, we should think about which groups of people might be more vulnerable or face unique challenges in society. This could include non-White research participants, the elderly, clients with a physical disability, and people afflicted with a chronic disease.\n\nNow, we need to identify which group is most likely to be prioritized by the APA in their research. The APA is likely to focus on groups that face unique challenges or disparities in mental health care, and that have been historically underrepresented in psychological research.\n\nTaking these factors into account, the answer can be determined.\n\n(A) non-White research participants",

            "model_answer": "First, let's briefly summarize the stages of Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's (1993) Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model:\n\n1. Encounter: Individuals become aware of their minority status and experience feelings of alienation.\n2. Dissonance: Individuals begin to question their own cultural identity and the dominant culture.\n3. Integrative awareness: Individuals start to incorporate elements from both their own culture and the dominant culture.\n4. Introspection: Individuals achieve a sense of balance and harmony between their own cultural identity and the dominant culture.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) encounter: This stage is about becoming aware of one's minority status, not questioning the rejection of the dominant culture.\n(B) dissonance: This stage is about questioning one's own cultural identity and the dominant culture, but it does not imply a rejection of the dominant culture.\n(C) integrative awareness: This stage is about incorporating elements from both cultures, not questioning the rejection of the dominant culture.\n(D) introspection: This stage is about achieving a balance between one's own cultural identity and the dominant culture, but it does not necessarily involve questioning the rejection of the dominant culture.\n\nAfter analyzing the options, we can determine that none of them accurately describe the stage in which people begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture.",

However, this doesn't necessarily mean that nonparametric statistics should always be used instead of parametric statistics. The best choice of statistical test depends on the specific situation and the assumptions of the data.\n\n(B) This option states that nonparametric statistics should be used when the form of the distribution of scores in the investigated population is not known. This is a valid reason to use nonparametric statistics because they do not rely on specific assumptions about the distribution of the data.\n\n(C) This option suggests that nonparametric statistics should be used when the data in the investigated population represent a continuous variable. This option is not a strong reason to use nonparametric statistics, as both parametric and nonparametric tests can be used with continuous variables.\n\n(D) This option states that nonparametric statistics should be used when the data in the investigated population are known to fulfill the requirements of an interval scale. This option is not a strong reason to use nonparametric statistics, as parametric tests can also be used with interval-level data.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B)",
