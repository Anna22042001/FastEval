Mel finished above Ada.\n\nFrom points 2 and 3, we know that Ada is in the middle position among the three golfers. We can represent this as:\n\nAda < Mya < Mel\n\nFrom the information given, we cannot determine which golfer finished last. Both options (A) and (C) are possible, as Ada could have finished last among the three golfers, or Mya could have finished last.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that we do not have enough information to determine who finished last with certainty. So, the correct answer should be:\n\n(D) We cannot determine from the information given.",

Since Mel and Ana have specific positions, Ada must have finished first.\n\nNow we can eliminate the options that do not match the order of finish:\n\n1. (A) Mel finished last - CORRECT\n2.
