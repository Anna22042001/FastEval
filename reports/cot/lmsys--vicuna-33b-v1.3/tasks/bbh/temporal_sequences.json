If we assume a typical movie length of 2 hours, we should add 2 hours to our final window of time.\n4. Lastly, we need to factor in the closing time of the movies.

Leslie was also seen taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 10am to 3pm, but we don't know how much time passed between the bakery and the photo session. However, the orchestra hall was closed after 8pm, so we need to account for at least 12 hours.\n4. Since the orchestra hall was closed after 8pm, we need to account for 12 hours from the start of the bakery visit until the hall closes. So, we can add 4 hours after the bakery visit, taking us to 1pm.\n5. Now, we need to take into account the time when Leslie was seen taking photos near the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
