We know there are 4 giraffes in the table, and we need to find out how many of them are more than 5 years old.\n2. Next, we'll analyze the data provided. The age of each giraffe is given in years. We need to identify which giraffes are older than 5 years.\n3. Now, let's look at the ages of the giraffes:\n\t* Jody: 5 years\n\t* Gladys: 10 years\n\t* Marian: 2 years\n\t* Donna: 9 years\n4. We previously identified that we need to find the number of giraffes older than 5 years. Based on the information, Gladys and Donna are the only two giraffes that are more than 5 years old.\n5. Finally, we can determine the answer. Since there are 2 giraffes more than 5 years old, the correct answer is (B) 2.",
