This statement could be genuine.\n\nNow, we analyze statement (B): He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need.\n\nPossible sarcasm indicator: The use of \"terrible\" is an exaggeration, as it's unlikely that someone promoting a charity stream would be considered terrible.

Sarcasm is often used to convey irony or contempt, so I'll analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): \"Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore\"\nThis statement could be perceived as insensitive and unhelpful. It seems to trivialize depression and suggest that it's easy to just \"be happy.\" This may indicate sarcasm, as the speaker might be mocking the misunderstanding of depression.\n\nOption (B): \"Hey just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore\"\nThis statement has a more neutral tone and it's possible to interpret it as a genuine expression of happiness. However, it could still be sarcastic if the speaker is using irony to highlight the difficulty of overcoming depression.\n\nTo determine which statement is more likely to be sarcastic, I need to look for contextual clues. If the speaker is known to use sarcasm frequently or if the conversation revolves around the challenges of mental health, option (A) might be more likely to be sarcastic. On the other hand, if the conversation is generally positive and focused on personal growth, option (B) might be more likely to be sarcastic.\n\nSince there's no clear indication of the context, I'll make a guess based on the tone and potential for sarcasm in each option.\n\nAnswer: (A) Hey just be happy then you won't be depressed anymore (sarcastic)",

In this case, both statements mention unusual takeout container choices, but they could be genuine observations.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the statement is exaggerated or contrary to expectations\nSarcasm often involves exaggeration or a contrary perspective.
