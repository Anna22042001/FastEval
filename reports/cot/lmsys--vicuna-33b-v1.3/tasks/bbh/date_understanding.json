There are 3 appointment slots and 5 people, so we need to find a day that is divisible by both 3 and 5 to accommodate everyone.\n\n1. First, we need to determine the day of the week today (since we are given the date as MM/DD/YYYY, which is ambiguous without knowing the month). It is Monday, 7/9/1972. Monday is represented by 0 in the day of the week cycle.\n2. Today's date is 7/9/1972, and tomorrow will be 8/9/1972.\n3. We need to check the day of the week for 8/9/1972. To find this, we can add 8 to the previous day number, which gives us 8 (since Monday is 0). So, the day of the week for 8/9/1972 is Monday as well.\n4. However, this doesn't satisfy the requirement of a day divisible by both 3 and 5, so we need to adjust the date by adding 3 to the day number. This gives us 11 as the day of the week for 11/9/1972.\n5. Now, 11/9/1972 is divisible by both 3 and 5, and it is also a Tuesday, which is consistent with the prompt.\n\nThe answer is: (D) 07/09/1972",

However, the question states that May 6, 1992 is like \"yesterday\" to Jane, which implies that she is considering the date based on her personal experience, not the actual calendar days that have passed.\n\nWe can calculate the age Jane was considering as follows:\n\n1. Jane considers May 6, 1992 as \"yesterday.\"\n2. Today is May 6, 2023.\n3.

We can do this by adding the number of days in the months between March and today.\n\nMarch 20, 2020, is 72 days into the year (31 days in January + 28 days in February). So, we have 72 + 176 = 248 days passed in 2020 so far. Today is August 12, 2020, which is the 224th day of the year (31 days in January + 28 days in February + 31 days in March + 30 days in April + 12 days in May + 31 days in June + 12 days in July).\n\nTo find the date tomorrow, we need to add 1 day to today's date. So, we will have 224 + 1 = 225 days passed in 2020 so far.\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of days remaining in the year.
