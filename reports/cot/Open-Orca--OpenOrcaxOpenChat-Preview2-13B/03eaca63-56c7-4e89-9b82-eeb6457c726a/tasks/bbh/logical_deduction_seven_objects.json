Similarly, the quail should be the seventh from the left.\n\nNow we can compare each option with the deduced positions from the given information:\n\n(A) The robin is the fourth from the left: The falcon is to the left of the robin, so the robin is actually the third from the left.

This places watermelons as the second-most expensive and apples as less expensive than the second-most expensive fruit (cantaloupes).\n\nStep 2: The paragraph also mentions that the loquats are less expensive than the kiwis. Using the information from step 1, we know loquats are less expensive than the apples, so loquats are less expensive than the watermelons. Since loquats are less expensive than the watermelons and watermelons are the second-most expensive, loquats cannot be the most expensive.\n\nStep 3: From the given information, we know that watermelons are the second-most expensive, cantaloupes are above them, and watermelons are more expensive than pears. Therefore, the pears are less expensive than the watermelons, and pears are less expensive than the cantaloupes and apples.\n\nStep 4: Plums are the cheapest among all the fruits, making them the least expensive across the board.\n\nWith all these steps and information, the most expensive fruit among these given options is not watermelons, kiwis, cantaloupes, pears, or even apples, but:\n\nThe correct answer is (E) The watermelons are the most expensive.",
