Thus, it follows that T > C, which contradicts the fact that C > T. So option (A) cannot be correct.\n- The motorcycle (M) is younger than the convertible (C). This means that M < C. Therefore, M > T does not hold. So option (B) cannot be correct. \n- However, we still have the information that M > C and C < T. Since the convertible (C) is the common vehicle between these two pairs of vehicles in the relationships, the most logical conclusion is that C is the oldest among these.\n\nSo the answer is:\n(A) The convertible is the oldest.",
