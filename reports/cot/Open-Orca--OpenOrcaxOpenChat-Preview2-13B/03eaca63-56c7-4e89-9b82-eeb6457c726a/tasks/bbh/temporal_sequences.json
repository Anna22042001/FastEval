Between 2pm and 3pm: Impossible; Tiffany saw David getting a coffee at the cafe instead.\n5. Between 3pm and 4pm: Possible, as that's when James saw David fixing their computer.\n6. Between 4pm and 5pm: Possible, as that's when David was at the library with Mark.\n7. Between 5pm and 6pm: Impossible; David was already at the library during these hours.\n8. Between 6pm and 8pm: Possible, since this is the time that the gas station was closed.\n\nBased on the timeline of events we have considered, the only time when David could have gone to the gas station is version (B) 6pm to 8pm. Once again, we are focusing on when did David have free time or time periods without being seen any of the places. So, the answer is (B) 6pm to 8pm.",

Between what times could they have gone?\nWe know that:\nSamantha woke up at 5am.\nSarah saw Samantha buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 6am.\nRichard saw Samantha waiting at the airport from 6am to 12pm.\nJohn saw Samantha buying clothes at the mall from 12pm to 2pm.\nAnthony saw Samantha sitting on a rooftop from 2pm to 3pm.\nThe bakery was closed after 9pm.\nBetween what times could Samantha have gone to the bakery?\nOptions:\n(A) 6am to 12pm\n(B) 2pm to 3pm\n(C) 5am to 6am\n(D) 3pm to 9pm",

            "model_answer": "First, we list the activities Samantha does between the given times:\n\n1. Sleeping - 5am (from 5am to 6am).\n2. Buying a phone - 5am to 6am (from 5am to 6am).\n3. Waiting at the airport - 6am to 12pm (from 6am to 12pm).\n4. Buying clothes - 12pm to 2pm (from 12pm to 2pm).\n5. Sitting on a rooftop - 2pm to 3pm (from 2pm to 3pm).\n6. Going to the bakery.\n\nWe know that Samantha went to the bakery before it closed at 9pm, and John saw her at the mall from 12pm to 2pm. This means that the time during which Samantha went to the bakery comes after John saw her at the mall (from 2pm to 3pm).\n\nWe can create two possible timeframes when she might have gone to the bakery, considering that she left at 2pm and did not go to the mall again: \n\na) From 2pm to 3pm: Samantha could have immediately gone to the bakery after running errands from 5am to 2pm\nb) From 3pm to 4pm: This would be a plausible timeframe if Samantha buys clothes, goes to the bakery, and then towards the bakery.\n\nGiven the timeframes, option (B) 2pm to 3pm appears more plausible, as it's more reasonable for Samantha to go to the bakery right after sighted with her buying clothes at the mall.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(B) 2pm to 3pm",

So, William could have gone to the coffee shop at any point between 9am and 11am. However, after attending his class and before 6pm when he walked in the garden, the coffee shop was not open.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(B) 9am to 11am",
