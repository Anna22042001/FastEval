Restrictive relative clause: \"Indian\" is a nationality describing the make of the motorcycle.\n4.

It seems extraneous.\n2. smoking: This seems inappropriate here because the adjective suggested is \"smoking,\" but no noun is clear enough to warrant an adjective representation.

It is like saying \"Shape or Form before general characteristic\" which would adhere to most English grammar rules. Although it may vary in some sentences, which usually depends on the context.\n\nTaking this into account, when we look at her alternatives in this context:\n(A) wool repulsive prismlike American chair\nis grammatically preferable based on the traditional adjective order in English.\n\nSo, our final output is:\n(A) wool repulsive prismlike American chair",

            "model_answer": "(B) circular wonderful smoking Pakistani big orange car\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. In adjective order, the adjectives should be in the following order: determiner (if any), opinion, size, shape, color, origin, materials, qualities, purpose.\n2. In the given sentence (A), the adjectives break this order quite a bit, but we can quickly arrange them to make sense: big -> circular -> orange -> character (since smoking refers to the cigarette addiction of the Pakistani person).\n3. In sentence (B), the adjectives are ordered in accord with the adjective order rule: circular (shape), wonderful (opinion), Pakistani (origin), big (size), smoking (result of addiction), orange (color).\n\nFinal answer (B) circular wonderful smoking Pakistani big orange car",

'Grey' is the color, and 'cardboard' is the material. So, the order in (A) is correct.\n(B) 'Prismlike' comes before 'cardboard', which should have been the other way around based on the adjective rule. 'Grey' is mentioned before 'medium-size,' which should be the other way around, also.

Placing this with 'big' and 'ridiculous' creates confusion and is not making any sense based on the adjective ending rule, similarly placing it with 'green' and 'silver' give the same confusion. Therefore REDUNDENCY OCCURS as both 'silver' and 'green' are used. It also fits the basic lay out of the adjective endings that after shape we generally use age, hence 'ancient' after 'rectangular' makes sense. \n\nHowever, the sentence (B) clearly follows the same adjective rule. The 'ridiculous' is placed correctly followed by 'big' which is around size, 'ancient' which is age, 'rectangular' (shape), 'green' and 'silver' follow the rule of appearance.

            "model_answer": "(B) midsize silly tan computer\n\nReasoning:\nIn English, adjectives usually follow specific rules for word order. The order should be determined by a specific hierarchy, and in most cases where there are two or more adjectives, they should come after the noun. Also, consider if the adjectives refer to specific categories or the noun.\n\nIn the sentence (A) silly midsize tan computer, the adjective \"silly\" refers to the category of computers while \"midsize\" and \"tan\" seem to describe additional traits of the computer. Also, \"silly\" should be placed at the end of the sentence since it refers to the whole group of computers. This order is incorrect according to the adjective hierarchy.\n\nIn the sentence (B) midsize silly tan computer, the adjective \"midsize\" refers to a category or specific type of computer, while \"silly\" again refers to the whole group, and \"tan\" refers to the appearance or design of the computer.\n\nSo, the correct order for Adjective Hierarchy in this case would be:\n- Midsize (category)\n- Silly (category)\n- Tan (trait)\n\nHence, the correct adjective order is \"midsize silly tan computer\", which is represented by option (B).",

Resolve any ambiguity among adjectives by using the proximity principle: place the adjectives that provide the most useful information closest to the noun, leaving the details to be added farther away.\n3. Ensure proper punctuation and grammar.\n\nIn Option A:\n\n\"ridiculous grey cardboard whittling motorcycle\"\n\n1. Noun being modified: \"cardboard motorcycle\"\n2. Structure the adjectives according to the rule:\n  a. The adjectives 'ridiculous', 'grey', and 'whittling' describe opinion, size, and purpose respectively. Therefore, their order should be 'ridiculous', 'grey', and 'whittling'.\n  b. In this case, 'cardboard' simply identifies the material, so it should follow 'ridiculous' and 'grey'.\n\nSo, after analyzing the sentence, we can conclude that the correct adjective order in Option A is \"whittling ridiculous grey cardboard motorcycle.\"\n\nIn Option B:\n\n\"cardboard ridiculous whittling grey motorcycle\"\n\nThe adjective order is reversed and does not follow the given rule.
