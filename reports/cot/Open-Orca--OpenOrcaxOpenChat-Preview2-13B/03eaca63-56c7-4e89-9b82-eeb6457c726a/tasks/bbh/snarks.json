Yeah, no one is rewatching\n(B) It only received the highest gross sales for any recent action film. Yeah, no one is rewatching\n\nStep 1: Analyze the meaning of each statement\nStatement A implies that the action film had low gross sales, which is not a good thing for a film. However, the sarcastic part is the statement \"Yeah, no one is rewatching,\" which suggests that the film is not worth watching even once.\n\nStatement B implies that the action film had high gross sales, which is a good thing for a film. However, the sarcastic part is the statement \"Yeah, no one is rewatching,\" which suggests that the film is not worth watching even once.\n\nStep 2: Identify the tone\nBoth statements have a sarcastic tone, as they both use the phrase \"Yeah, no one is rewatching\" to mock the success of the action film.\n\nStep 3: Determine the sarcastic statement\nSince both statements have a sarcastic tone, it is difficult to determine which one is more sarcastic. However, since statement A is about a film with low gross sales, it might be considered more sarcastic because it is more likely to be true that people would not rewatch a film with low gross sales.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
