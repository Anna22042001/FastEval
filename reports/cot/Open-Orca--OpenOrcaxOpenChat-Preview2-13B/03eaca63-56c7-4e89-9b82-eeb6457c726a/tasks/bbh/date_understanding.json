We are given the current date, which is the first Monday of 2019.\n\nThe first Monday of a given year falls on the day that immediately follows the first Sunday:\n\n1. 2019 = 1\n2. 2018 = 0 (2018 was a leap year with February having 29 days)\n\nHence, the first Monday of 2018 happened on January 1, 2018.\n\nNext, we need to look at the second point because the day mentioned is a Tuesday:\nThe first day of a month that corresponds to the day of the week mentioned is the day immediately before that day (adding days before the given day).\n\nSo, January 1, 2018 Tuesday:\nFirst day of January is always on January 1 - since it is a Monday, the first day of January is on January 1.\n\nTherefore, January 1, 2018 is a Monday, and we need to find the day before it - December 31, 2017.\n\nThe final step is to identify the year by counting backwards:\n1. 2018 = 1\n2. 2017 = 0\n3. 2016 = -1\n\nTherefore, if February 2018 happened one year ago from today (January 1 to March 1, 2019), we need to count from the end of January 2017 to early 2016.\n\nNow, subtract the difference in days:\n\n1. January had 31 days in 2017 but only has 29 days in 2018 (since it's not a leap year)\n2. February had 28 days in February 2017 but only had 28 days in February 2018 (since it's not a leap year)\n3. March had 31 days in 2017 but only had 28 days in 2018 (since the last few days of March in 2017 weren't covered)\n\nMiddle of February = (day before February 1, 2018 - day before February 1, 2017) - (days in February 2017 x 3)\n\u21d2 (28-29) days x 3 (February in both years had only 28 days) = -5 x 3 = -15 \n\nSo, January 1, 2018 - January 1 - 15 days = January 15, 2017 (first round the date).\n\nNow, to adjust for the missing days for the remainder of March 2017:\n- March 29, 2017 - December 31, 2016 - January 1, 2017 + 28 days (since February 2017 had only 28 days):\n   i.e., March 29, 2017 - (29 + 0 + 28) = March 29, 2017 - 57 days\n\nSo, January 15, 2017 (which is January 1 - January 15), modified for adjustment, still equals February 29, 2016.\n\nTo sum up, one year ago from today is February 29, 2016. This is the only date not in our given options, which have a mix of February and January dates. \n\nTherefore, the correct option should not be among the given options.
