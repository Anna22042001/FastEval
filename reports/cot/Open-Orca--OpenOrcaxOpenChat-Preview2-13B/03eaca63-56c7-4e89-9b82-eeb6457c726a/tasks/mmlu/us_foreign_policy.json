            "model_answer": "(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n\nStep 1: Understand the question\nThe question asks why countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market, even though international trade is generally beneficial for both countries.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership - This option suggests that the leaders of a country might not be making rational decisions when it comes to international trade. While this could be a factor in some cases, it doesn't explain the general trend of countries trying to protect their firms.\n\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed - This option suggests that the costs of free trade are felt by a small number of people or firms, while the benefits are spread out among a larger population. This could be a reason for countries to try to protect their own firms, as they may feel that the costs outweigh the benefits for them.\n\n(C) Regime type - This option suggests that the type of government in a country might influence its approach to international trade. While this could be a factor in some cases, it doesn't explain the general trend of countries trying to protect their firms.\n\n(D) International conflict prevents trade - This option suggests that countries might try to protect their firms from exposure to the world market due to ongoing international conflicts. While this could be a factor in some cases, it doesn't explain the general trend of countries trying to protect their firms.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best answer\nBased on the analysis of the given options, the best answer is (B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed. This option explains the general trend of countries trying to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market, as they may feel that the costs outweigh the benefits for them.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy\n\nExplanation:\n\nWorld War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States primarily because of the United States' role as a creditor country and financial center. As European countries engaged in war spending, they needed to borrow money from the United States to finance their war efforts. This influx of borrowed money boosted the US economy, as it provided a source of income for the United States. Additionally, the war led to the destruction of infrastructure and resources in Europe, further weakening their economic position.\n\nAnswer: D",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first analyze each of the given mechanisms and their relevance to international trade agreements.\n\n(A) Reciprocity across multiple issues: This mechanism refers to the idea that countries negotiate and agree on mutual concessions in various areas of trade. This is a common approach in international trade agreements, as countries often seek to balance their interests and gain access to each other's markets.\n\n(B) Reputational concerns of the actors: This mechanism refers to the idea that countries are concerned about their reputation and how they are perceived by other countries. This can influence their willingness to cooperate and negotiate in international trade agreements.\n\n(C) Side payments for adjusting to the organization (such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU): This mechanism refers to the idea that countries may provide financial or other incentives to help other countries adjust to the new trade agreement. This can be seen in the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU, where financial support is provided to farmers to help them adapt to the new rules and regulations.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(D) ALL of the above: This option suggests that all three mechanisms are used in international trade agreements.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) ALL of the above",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is the belief that the United States is unique and superior to other nations, often due to its founding principles, democratic values, and economic success. This belief can lead to opposition to world government for several reasons.\n\nFirst, American exceptionalism is often associated with a strong sense of nationalism and patriotism. This can lead to a belief that the United States should maintain its sovereignty and not be subject to a world government.\n\nSecond, American exceptionalism is rooted in the idea that the United States is a \"shining city upon a hill,\" a beacon of democracy and freedom for the world. This belief can lead to the idea that the United States should be a leader in global affairs, rather than being subservient to a world government.\n\nThird, American exceptionalism often includes a distrust of centralized power and authority. This can lead to opposition to world government, as it would represent a significant concentration of power and decision-making in a single entity.\n\nIn conclusion, American exceptionalism can lead to opposition to world government due to its general anti-statism, which opposes centralized government.",
