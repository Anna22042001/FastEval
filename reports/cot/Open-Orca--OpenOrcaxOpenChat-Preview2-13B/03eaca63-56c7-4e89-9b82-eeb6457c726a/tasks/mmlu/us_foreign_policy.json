            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) It allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam\n\nThe Gulf of Tonkin resolution was significant because it served as the legal justification for the United States to escalate its involvement in the Vietnam War. On August 7, 1964, North Vietnamese ships allegedly attacked US ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. This event led to Congress passing the Gulf of Tonkin resolution on August 10, which was intended to prevent any further \"aggressive movements\" by the communist government of North Vietnam. \n\nThis resolution allowed President Lyndon B. Johnson to order military operations without requesting explicit congressional approval, thereby expanding the U.S. role in the Vietnam War. Though the intention was to protect U.S. interests, the resolution ultimately had a mixed impact on public opinion about the war and the subsequent political maneuverings that took place.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To figure out who was the first American president to visit communist China, we need to consider the historical context in which these visits occurred. China became a communist country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party after the Chinese Civil War. Communist China was established on October 1, 1949. The timeline on which these American presidents reigned should be considered:\n  \n1. Richard Nixon: 37th US President, served from 1969 to 1974.\n2. George H. W. Bush: 41st US President, served from 1989 to 1993.\n3. Jimmy Carter: 39th US President, served from 1977 to 1981.\n4. Ronald Reagan: 40th US President, served from 1981 to 1989.\n\nWe can notice that George H. W. Bush served after communist China existed, and conscient his presidency is carefully between the start of China's communism and Nixon's presidency. Hence, we could consider him as a potential candidate to be the first American president to visit communist China.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the first American president to visit communist China, it implies that the visit occurred a little before the development of China's communism reached its apex. So, we need to find a president earlier on the timeline than George H. W. Bush.\n\nNow, let's look at the timeline for Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Nixon was the president from 1969 to 1974, while Carter's presidency was from 1977 to 1981. Nixon visited China in 1972, well before George H.W. Bush's presidency. Jimmy Carter's presidency was after Nixon's visit, and there is no record of him being the first American president to visit China.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Richard Nixon as he was the first American president to visit communist China.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(C) The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism\n\nThe Cold War influenced American exceptionalism in several ways. It led to the assumption that America held a special role as the leader of the free world and the arbiter of global conflict. This role, however, did not come without costs.\n\nWhile the United States was economically, ideologically, and militarily strong during the Cold War, the challenges faced by American politicians led to questioning some of the core assumptions of American exceptionalism. This was because in order to be the 'leader of the free world', American policies and actions abroad often had to be justified in the context of the global struggle against communism, rather than simply promoting US interests or values. Additionally, the United States' prolonged engagement in wars, such as the Korean War and the Vietnam War, brought about combined forces with NATO and the United Nations but had its critics at home, which fueled a much more complicated international image for American exceptionalism.\n\nTherefore, the implications of the Cold War challenged conventional wisdom about American exceptionalism, but did not necessarily end the influence of exceptionalism entirely (A) or simply enhance it (B).",

Roosevelt initially favored an isolationist stance on the part of the US during the 1930s for several reasons. First, he believed that focusing on internal reforms and improving the US economy was more important than getting involved in international negotiations. He felt that the US had many problems of its own to address and that it needed to be prepared internally for future conflicts. Additionally, there were still strong anti-war sentiment and isolationist feelings among the American public, which Roosevelt considered when making foreign policy decisions. Lastly, the personal history of Roosevelt as he had witnessed World War I's devastation firsthand, which further inclined him towards isolationist ideology.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break down the ways World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States:\n\n1. European population levels: While this might have been true, it didn't necessarily shift economic power away from Europe. \n\n2. Seizure of German resources: This could have helped the American economy during the war, but did not drag European economic power to the US.\n\n3. European countries paid the United States for assistance: During WWI, both the UK and other countries contracted the US to ship supplies and material; thus, the US became a seller of resources. The money earned from these transactions could be helpful but not crucial in shifting power.\n\n4. The United States became a creditor country and financial center: European war spending during WWI boosted the US economy, as many countries were dependent on the US for resources and supplies. Consequently, at the end of the war, the US was able to demand restitutions and loans from the European powers. This point clearly indicates that the US took advantage of the economic imbalance gained due to WWI, fully benefitting from it.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer is--\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial center, with European war spending boosting the US economy",
