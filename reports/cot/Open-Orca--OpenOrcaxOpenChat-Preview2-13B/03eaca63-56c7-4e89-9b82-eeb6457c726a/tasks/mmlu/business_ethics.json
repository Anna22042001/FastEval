It does not directly relate to balance between work and non-work, but rather the physical presence at the workplace.\n\n(B) Absenteeism: This refers to an employee's absence from work without a reasonable excuse, along with chronic or excessive absence (missing more workdays than necessary). Absenteeism doesn't represent a balance, but rather an unmatched equation between work and non-work.\n\n(C) Work-play balance: This term, while often used in everyday conversation, doesn't have a clear definition in the context of balancing one's work-life and is not accepted by professionals in workplace management and psychology.\n\n(D) Work-life balance: This refers to an employee's preferred balance between time spent on work and time spent on their personal, family, and leisure activities.

The concept describes a network of organisms and their environments that work together, with considerations for the need for sustainability and interdependencies among industries.\n\nA) Industrial supply loops are systems that connect different parts of an industry to efficiently manage resources and supply materials. This answer is close to the concept, but it lacks the connection to the environment and the ecological aspects mentioned in the question.\n\nB) Industrial ecosystems sound similar to the concept because both involve interdependent relationships among organisms and their environments \u2013 the key difference is that industrial ecosystems are more focused on production and manufacturing systems.\n\nC) Ecological ecosystems are systems in nature where organisms interact with each other and their environment. Although this answer also mentions interdependencies, it is more related to natural ecosystems rather than the concept of sustainability in industry and the connections among companies and industries.\n\nD) Corporate ecosystems are complex networks of relationships and cooperations among companies. While this answer could include some of the interdependencies mentioned in the question, it does not sufficiently connect this idea to natural ecosystems or the concept of sustainability.\n\nBased on the provided information, the answer is:\n\n(B) Industrial ecosystems",

But the term \"resources\" seems to be less related to the risk involved.\n\n(C) Informational asymmetries, Benefits, Hoodwinked\n- Correct, as there are informational asymmetries, and parties gain more benefits, but there is no indication of being hoodwinked.\n\n(D) Informational asymmetries, Resources, Co-opted\n- Correct for the informational asymmetries and co-opted aspects, but the term \"resources\" seems unrelated to the risk involved.\n\nAnswer: (B) Power imbalance, Resources, Co-opted",

It can include the idea of corporate profit maximization, but it may not be the primary goal for every individual.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative is a philosophical principle from Immanuel Kant's ethical theory, which states that individuals should act according to universal moral laws in all circumstances. This focuses on individual ethical behavior rather than corporate profit maximization.\n\n(D) The ethics of care emphasize the importance of interpersonal relationships, empathy, and emotions in determining moral behavior. While it acknowledges the role of interpersonal relationships in a corporation, it does not specifically require corporate profit maximization as the primary goal.\n\nSince 'corporate profit maximization' refers to the financial gain of a corporation, the theory most similar but not directly prescribed is the preference utilitarianism (B).\n\nAnswer: (B) preference utilitarianism",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's examine the terms provided in the question: regulation, civil society organizations (CSOs), and businesses.\n\nIn terms of the subject, we have two options: Legal and Civil. Civil refers to rules that regulate social, economic, and political organizations and interactions, while the term Legal pertains to the rules created and enforced through social or governmental institutions.\n\nRelations could be another potential term referring to how different entities interact with one another.\n\nThe keyword \"outcomes\" stresses that the regulations aren\u2019t just about prescriptions or enforcing rights but address the very nature of actions and results in terms of\u2014responsibilities, consequences and how these responsibilities and consequences can be applied to real world or tangible situations.\n\nMechanics refer to the procedures, stages used in running a process, etc.\n\nPutting these terms in combinations, we will go through each possibility to evaluate if it fulfils all the demands of the question:\n\n(A) Legal, Interactions, Mechanics - \u201cmechanics\u201d strays from the focus on outcomes of interaction. Also, while legal refers to rules, it doesn\u2019t take into account CSOs\u2019 interactions with businesses.\n\n(B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes - Civil regulations would be a good fit, considering that they refer to the rules that regulate social, economic, and political interactions between different entities. However, \"relations\" is less correct, as it simply refers to connections between entities.\n\n(C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes - Although Political is close to Legal, it is not suitable because it does not address interactions with businesses sufficiently. Similarly, \"Interactions\" could describe how CSOs interact with businesses but not the \"outcomes\" of those interactions.\n\n(D) Environmental, Relations, Mechanics - This choice doesn't fit the question as the focus is on CSOs' relationship with businesses, which would better fit within Civil regulations.\n\nThe answer (B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes fits best as the correct choice, as it shows the nature of the rules that regulate civil society organizations' interactions beyond businesses.\n\nAnswer: (B) Civil, Relations, Outcomes",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to determine which of the given options best describes working practices that involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity.\n\n(A) Dynamic - This term refers to the process and status of change, which implies that the working practices are continuously evolving and adaptable. While dynamic practices might involve some fluidity, the term could have broader connotations as well.\n\n(B) Fluid - This term generally refers to something flowing or easily changing, which aligns perfectly with the characteristics of flexible or adaptable working patterns. Thus, fluid working practices would involve temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity.\n\n(C) Flexible - Similar to fluid, flexible working practices involve adaptability and the ability to change in response to different circumstances. These working patterns can be reshaped, rearranged or varied to accommodate different needs and contexts.\n\n(D) Modern - This term has multiple meanings and could include anything from recent to advanced to forward-thinking, so it is not a suitable description for fluid working practices in the context of temporal, spatial, and task-related fluidity.\n\nBased on the given options, the best answer is:\n\n(B) Fluid",
