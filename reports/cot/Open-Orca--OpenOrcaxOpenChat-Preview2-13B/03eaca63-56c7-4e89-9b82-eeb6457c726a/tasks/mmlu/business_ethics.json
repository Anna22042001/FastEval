            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of enlightened self-interest and how it relates to CSR.\n\nEnlightened self-interest is a concept that suggests that an individual or organization can benefit by acting in a way that is not only in their own best interest, but also in the best interest of others. This approach suggests that by acting ethically and responsibly, an organization can create long-term value for itself and its stakeholders.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) This option suggests that an organization should prioritize its own interests over ethics, which contradicts the concept of enlightened self-interest.\n\n(B) This option states that an organization should consider what a shareholder would want, which is a part of the enlightened self-interest model. However, it does not fully capture the essence of the concept.\n\n(C) This option aligns with the enlightened self-interest model, as it suggests that an organization should act in an ethical way to benefit itself and its stakeholders.\n\n(D) This option focuses on following the law and abiding by legislation, which is a part of the enlightened self-interest model but does not fully capture the essence of the concept.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n(C) That it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way",
