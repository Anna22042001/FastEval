            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand how the body compensates for increased environmental temperature.\n\nStep 1: Understand the body's response to heat\nWhen the body experiences an increase in environmental temperature, it tries to maintain a stable internal temperature. This is done through various physiological mechanisms, such as sweating, which helps to dissipate heat.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options\n(A) Decreasing salt retention: This is not a direct response to increased environmental temperature. The body's salt retention is regulated by the kidneys and is not directly related to temperature.\n(B) Increasing respiration rate: Increasing the respiration rate can help the body to lose heat through the process of respiration. This is a possible response to increased environmental temperature.\n(C) Increasing heart rate: Increasing the heart rate can help to pump more blood through the body, which can help to dissipate heat. This is also a possible response to increased environmental temperature.\n(D) Increasing water lost through skin: Sweating is a way the body loses heat, so this is a possible response to increased environmental temperature.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best answer\nBoth (B) and (C) are possible responses to increased environmental temperature, as they help the body to lose heat. However, (B) increasing respiration rate is the more direct response to heat, as it helps to dissipate heat through the process of respiration.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

This process is called anaerobic glycolysis.\n\nStep 2: Lactate transport\nLactate is transported out of the muscle cells and into the bloodstream through the blood-muscle barrier.\n\nStep 3: Lactate transport to other tissues\nLactate is transported to other tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys, where it can be used as an energy source or converted into other molecules.\n\nStep 4: Lactate metabolism\nLactate can be metabolized in various ways depending on the tissue it reaches.\n\n(A) Conversion to urea in the liver: Lactate can be converted to pyruvate in the liver, which can then be used to produce glucose or be converted to urea and excreted.\n(B) Conversion to glucose in the heart: Lactate can be converted to pyruvate in the heart, which can then be used to produce glucose.\n(C) Excretion via the kidneys: Lactate can be filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine.\n(D) Uptake and oxidation by other tissues: Lactate can be taken up by other tissues, such as the brain, and used as an energy source through oxidation.\n\nBased on the processes mentioned above, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is:\n\n(D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the structure of a double-stranded DNA molecule and the composition of its bases.\n\nA double-stranded DNA molecule consists of two strands that are complementary to each other. Each strand is made up of a sequence of nucleotides, which are composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four types of nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C).\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) variable: This option suggests that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines can change depending on the base sequence in DNA. However, this is not true, as the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is always 1:1 in a double-stranded DNA molecule.\n\n(B) determined by the base sequence in RNA: This option is incorrect because the base sequence in RNA is not relevant to the purine-pyrimidine ratio in DNA. The purine-pyrimidine ratio in DNA is determined by the structure of the DNA molecule itself, not by the RNA sequence.\n\n(C) genetically determined: This option is also incorrect because the purine-pyrimidine ratio in DNA is not determined by the genetic information encoded in the DNA sequence. The ratio is a structural property of the DNA molecule itself.\n\n(D) always 1:1: This option is correct because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded DNA molecule is always 1:1. This is due to the complementary nature of the base pairs, which consist of one purine (A or G) and one pyrimidine (T or C).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(D) always 1:1.",

If oxygen is not available, the citric acid cycle will not function properly, and the production of oxaloacetate will be affected.\n\n2.

It is produced during cellular respiration and is used to power various cellular processes, including muscle contractions. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy molecule that can donate a phosphate group to ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to form ATP, which can then be used for energy production.\n\nThe energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for a limited time. The duration of this energy supply depends on the amount of ATP and phosphocreatine available in the muscle cells.\n\nATP and phosphocreatine are stored in the muscle cells, and their levels can be replenished through glycolysis and the creatine phosphate shuttle system. However, these processes are not instantaneous, and the energy supply from ATP and phosphocreatine is limited.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 1-2 seconds: This is too short a duration for ATP and phosphocreatine to provide energy for maximal exertion exercise.\n\n(B) 5-10 seconds: This is a more reasonable duration for ATP and phosphocreatine to provide energy for maximal exertion exercise.\n\n(C) 30-40 seconds: This is longer than the typical duration of maximal exertion exercise, which is usually around 10 seconds.\n\n(D) 50-60 seconds: This is also longer than the typical duration of maximal exertion exercise.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 5-10 seconds.",
