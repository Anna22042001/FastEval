Although other factors mentioned could also be causes for difficulty, this option focuses on the size and organizational difficulty of the actual matrix itself. \n\nOption B deals with complex protection requirements and is not an inherent issue of the matrix approach. \n\nOption C talks about undecidability of deciding whether a process has access to a resource in an access matrix, which is an issue with the theory of access matrices in general, but not an inherent difficulty in the access matrix approach itself.\n\nOption D discusses who has rights to change the access matrix, which is more related to permissions and access control management, rather than inherent difficulty with the matrix approach.",

In version 2, the file read (along with the underlying layout on disk) was modified to retrieve blocks of 4,000 bytes.

First, we need to find how much time is saved due to the increase in block size. We do this by finding the unknown, which in this case is the time required to read 4,000 bytes (the new block size).\n\n2. Subtract the remaining time due to an increase in block size from the total time taken for the 1,000-byte blocks. \n\n3. Find the ratio by dividing the remaining time by the total time.\n\nFor the given problem, we have:\n\n- Under version 1: time for each block is 1 msec (per 1,000 bytes) and operating system overhead is 10 msec\n- Under version 2: time for each block is 2 msec (per 4,000 bytes) and operating system overhead is 20 msec\n\nLet's work through the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. The time for each block of 4,000 bytes is 2 msec:\n   4,000 bytes / 2 msec/4,000 = 1 msec\n\n2. Under version 1, the total time per large file is makeup of disk seek time (25 msec), disk latency time (8 msec), disk transfer time (1 msec per 1,000 bytes), and operating system overhead (10 msec). The time taken for 4,000 bytes under version 1 can be calculated as follows:\n   No change in disk seek, latency, and transfer times, but an increase in disk block size. Time savings for disk transfer would be approximately 40 msec (since it takes 4,000 bytes * 1 msec/4,000 = 1 msec).\n\n   Sum of total time and disk transfer time saving would mean that in terms of time complexity for version 1 there should be a tradeoff for disk transfer and operating system overhead time saved. \n\nSo let's calculate the change in operating system overhead:\n\n   Time savings for operation system overhead = 1 msec per 1,000 bytes * 4,000 = 4 msec\n\nTherefore, the total time saved by using 4,000-byte blocks under version 2, compared to 1,000-byte blocks under version 1, can be approximated as follows:\n\n   Time required (version 2) - (Version 1 total time + 4 msec) \u2248 Time required (version 2) - (25 msec + 1 msec + 8 msec + 4 msec)\n\n3. If we can replace the actual time values for version 1 with their approximated values, then we have:\n\n   Time required (version 2) - (38 msec + 4 msec) \u2248 Time required (version 2) - 42 msec\n\nNow, let's find the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1:\n\n   (Time required (version 2) / 42 msec) * 100 = (1 - 42 / 42) * 100 = 0.69\n\nThe final letter denoting the answer is:\n\n(B) 1:3.5",
