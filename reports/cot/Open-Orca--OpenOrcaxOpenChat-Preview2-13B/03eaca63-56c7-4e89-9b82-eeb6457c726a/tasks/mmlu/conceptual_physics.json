Draw a force vector with a magnitude of 10 N and an angle of 45\u00b0 with the horizontal as shown below:\n\n   \\/\n\n   The horizontal component is actually a 5 N force that is straight upwards, as shown below:\n\n   \\|\n\n2. The vertical component adds up to the horizontal component being perpendicular to it:\n\n   10 N (10N) = (5 N) /cos(45\u00b0)\n\n3. Calculate the horizontal component:\n\n   Horizontal component = 10 N /cos(45\u00b0)\n\n4. Calculate the cosine value of 45\u00b0:\n\n   cos(45\u00b0) = \u221a1/2\n\n5.

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what is the meaning of \"submerged\" object. An object is said to be submerged when it is completely under water, with its entire volume occupied by water.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Weight of fluid: An object submerged under water does not displace its weight because the weight is solely the property of the object, not the fluid.\n\n(B) Volume of fluid: When an object initially submerges in water it displaces its own volume because the two are now temporarily occupying the same space. So this displacement creates a \"dead\" volume within the fluid whose characteristics are that of the object.\n\n(C) Density of fluid: The density of the fluid does not depend on the object submerged in it. The density of the fluid would be constant regardless of the object.\n\n(D) All of these: While it's true that an object displaces a volume of fluid when submerged, it doesn't displace its own weight or density.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) volume of fluid.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. Let's first consider the angle at which the light is pointed and the properties of water. Light is refracted as it passes from air into water. When light passes from a denser medium to a less dense medium, its speed decreases.\n2. The speed of light in water is slower than its speed in air due to the higher refractive index of water. As a result, the speed of light in water is less than its speed in air.\n3. Therefore, at the boundary between water and air, the change of medium (from water to air, or vice versa) causes the light ray to change direction.\n4. When light is refracted, it can either total internal reflection (TIR) or pass through to the less dense medium.\n5. For total internal reflection to occur, the angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle.\n\nNow, let's think about the angle given, which is 20\u00b0 from the normal.\n\n6. According to Snell's law, the critical angle, \u03b8crit, in water can be calculated with this formula: \u03b8crit = sin-1(n_1 / n_2), where n1 and n2 are the refractive indexes of the two materials (in this case, water and air).\n7. Since diver is pointing the flashlight at 20\u00b0 from the normal, the light's angle of incidence (\u03b81) in water is also 20\u00b0.\n8. Since the flashlight is pointing down (with respect to the surface), the angle of refraction (\u03b82) in the air will also be 20\u00b0.\n9. Since both \u03b81 and \u03b82 are equal, the expression \u03b81 > \u03b8crit does not hold. And thus, total internal reflection does not occur.\n\nSo the beam of light does not (A) totally internally reflect, meaning that the answer is\n\n(B) passes into the air above.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) changes\n\nExplanation: When a voltage is induced in a wire loop, it is because of Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction. According to this law, the voltage induced (V) in the wire loop is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field (B) linked with the loop, hence:\nV = -NdB/dt\n\nWhere N is the number of turns of the loop and dB/dt is the rate of change of B. As you can see, the voltage induced is related to the rate of change of the magnetic field within the loop, which means when the magnetic field within the loop changes, a voltage will be induced. The other options (B, C, and D) are not correct, according to this reasoning.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (A) changes.",
