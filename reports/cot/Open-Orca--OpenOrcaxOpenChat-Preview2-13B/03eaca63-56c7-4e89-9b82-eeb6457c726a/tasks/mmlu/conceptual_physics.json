            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each statement in relation to general relativity.\n\n(A) Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\nGeneral relativity predicts that the path of light is affected by gravity. As light travels away from the Sun, it encounters the Sun's gravitational field, which causes the light to bend. This effect is known as gravitational lensing. So, the correct answer is (A).\n\n(B) Light passing the Sun is deflected.\nGeneral relativity predicts that light passing near a massive object, such as the Sun, will be deflected due to the gravitational field. This effect is known as gravitational lensing. So, the correct answer is (B).\n\n(C) A clock on the Sun's surface runs faster than on Earth.\nGeneral relativity predicts that time passes more slowly for an object in a stronger gravitational field. Since the Sun's gravitational field is stronger than Earth's, a clock on the Sun's surface would indeed run faster than a clock on Earth. So, the correct answer is (C).\n\n(D) All of these.\nSince all three statements are correct according to general relativity, the correct answer is (D).",

When an aircraft breaks the sound barrier, it creates a sonic boom.\n\n(B) Pulling out of a subsonic dive: A subsonic dive is when an aircraft is flying slower than the speed of sound.

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, we need to understand how a barometer works and the properties of water and mercury.\n\nA barometer is a scientific instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. It works by measuring the height to which a column of a specific fluid (usually mercury) rises in a tube. The height of the fluid column is directly proportional to the atmospheric pressure.\n\nNow, let's compare the properties of water and mercury:\n\n1. Density: Mercury is much denser than water.\n2. Viscosity: Water is more viscous than mercury.\n3. Surface tension: Water has a higher surface tension than mercury.\n\nConsidering these properties, we can deduce that a barometer using water instead of mercury would have a higher surface tension and lower viscosity. However, the density of water is lower than that of mercury.\n\nSince the height of the fluid column in a barometer is directly proportional to the atmospheric pressure, a barometer using water would have a lower density and higher surface tension, which would result in a taller column of water compared to a column of mercury of the same height.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) taller",
