            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(C) The initial choice of weights\n\nReasoning:\nThe initial choice of weights in a neural network plays a crucial role in determining the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. When the initial weights are randomly initialized, the network is more likely to underfit the data, as it may not have enough capacity to learn the complex patterns in the training data. On the other hand, if the initial weights are too close to the optimal solution, the network may overfit the data, leading to poor generalization performance.\n\nThe number of hidden nodes (A) and the learning rate (B) can also affect the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting, but they are not as critical as the initial choice of weights. The number of hidden nodes can impact the complexity of the model, but it is not the primary factor that determines the trade-off. The learning rate can also affect the model's ability to learn from the data, but it is more related to the convergence speed and the stability of the training process.\n\nThe use of a constant-term unit input (D) is not a structural assumption that affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. It is a feature of the input layer that can be used to incorporate constant terms in the input data, but it does not directly influence the model's ability to learn from the data or its generalization performance.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of regularization and its effect on the bias and variance of a linear regression model.\n\nRegularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by penalizing the model for having too many parameters. This is done by adding a regularization term to the loss function, which encourages the model to find simpler solutions.\n\nThere are two main types of regularization: L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge). L1 regularization penalizes the absolute value of the weights, while L2 regularization penalizes the squared value of the weights.\n\nNow, let's analyze the effect of increasing the L2 regularization coefficient on the bias and variance of the model.\n\nAs we increase the L2 regularization coefficient, the model will try to find simpler solutions by reducing the squared value of the weights. This will lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the weights, which in turn will reduce the variance of the model.\n\nHowever, the bias of the model will not change significantly. The bias is the average value of the model's predictions, and it is not directly affected by the regularization coefficient.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Bias increase ; Variance decrease",
