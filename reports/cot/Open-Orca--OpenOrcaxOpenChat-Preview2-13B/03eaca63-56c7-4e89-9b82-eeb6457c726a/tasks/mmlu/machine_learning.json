Linear regression minimizes the variance of the estimates, making it the most reliable model among unbiased estimators. \n\nStatement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\nThis is also true because AdaBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that trains an ensemble of decision trees to predict the target value. It uses the error rate of each tree as the stopping condition and updates the weights/coefficients in such a way that the error rate is decreasing. Since the coefficients are used for weighing predictions, it is always beneficial to have positive weights and, therefore, non-negative coefficients in AdaBoost. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(A) True, True",

They are non-linear models that borrow ideas from statistical learning theory and have non-linear decision boundaries. They work by finding the margin boundary where the two classes are most separated, which classifies new samples.\n\nLogistic regression models are a special case of linear models and are not conceptually the same as SVMs. While they too give a probability distribution, the methodology and the details of how they work are fundamentally different from SVMs.\n\nAs a result of this reasoning, Statement 1 is False.\n\nStatement 2:\nThe role of the kernel in SVM is to project the data into a higher dimensional space where a linear decision boundary can be drawn. Kernel functions are used in different settings to generalize the regular linear kernel. These include polynomial kernels which are potentially more powerful than linear kernels.\n\nAs mentioned in Statement 2, we would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to a higher order polynomial kernel. This is because support vectors indicate the decision boundary and the location of these vectors generally don't depend on the kernel function type they are working with. So, as long as the kernel function is continuous, the support vectors would be approximately the same across different kernels.\n\nIn light of this analysis, Statement 2 is True.\n\nThe answer to the question is (A) True, True.

They are suitable for handling the large number of parameters and highly irregular data structures common to image data. CNNs work by defining complex, non-linear feature extraction operations to process the input images. This is achieved by applying multiple layers, each performing a non-linear operation called a \"convolution\" on the input data, followed by a non-linear \"activation\" function. CNNs also contain pooling layers that extract the most important feature maps which are then processed further through other layers.\n\nWhen it comes to classifying high-resolution images, convolutional networks (A) have been proven to be superior to other architectures such as graph networks (B), fully connected networks (C), and RBF networks (D).\n\nAnswer: (A) convolutional networks",

The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a technique for finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of parameters in a probabilistic model. The algorithm involves iterative steps to improve and converge towards a more accurate estimate while working with incomplete data. Each step tends to increase log-likelihood because that's the focus of the EM algorithm.\n\nNow let's analyze Statement 2:\nOne disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\n\nResponse: This statement is false. Q-learning is an RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm that allows agents to learn from interaction with an environment.
