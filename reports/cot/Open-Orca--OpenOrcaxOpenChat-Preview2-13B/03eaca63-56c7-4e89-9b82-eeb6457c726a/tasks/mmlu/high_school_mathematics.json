Joe selects a fruit with equal probabilities (1/3) for each of the three types: an apple, an orange, or a banana.\n\nOn any given day during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he selects one fruit. Since there are three types of fruits, each type has an independent chance (1/3) of being selected.\n\nFor the problem statement, we want to find the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit. To do that, we will express his total combination of selecting a fruit in terms of probability, then solve for the probability of at least two different fruits.\n\n1. We journey through Joe's breakfast and consider the sequence: apple (A), orange (O), or banana (B).\n2. The probabilities of these events occurring are one third or 1/3 for each of the events A, O, or B.\n3. Therefore, the permutations available for Joe to choose O and B are AO, AO B, or AO B. \n4. The same approach is repeated for lunch and dinner. This approach tries to find the total potential outcomes from a repetitive condition (this sequence of fruits).\n\nTo determine the probability of at least two different fruits, we just have to add up the probabilities of all possibilities. We get,\n\nP(Apple OR Orange OR Banana) = P(A) + P(O) + P(B) \n\n= 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3\n\n= (1/3) \u00d7 (1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3)\n\n= 1/3 \u00d7 1\n\n= 1/3\n\nBy simplifying the equation, the probabilities of A, O, B are independent events. We can predict that within each possible selection, the probability of A, O, and B each occurring is equal, making their total probability add up to 1.\n\nAnswer: Given the probability is 1/3, and this is taking place over three instances - breakfast, lunch, and dinner - Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit \n\nThe probability then, would be:\n\n1 - (The probability that he'll eat the same type of fruit three times)\n\nThus, as the probability of choosing the same type of fruit three times is 3 out of 9 possibilities (3/9), that's the same as 1 minus this probability. \n\nSo, (1 - 3/9) = (2/9), simplifying this down by multiplying both sides by 9, we end up with 2.\n\nTherefore the answer is:\n\n(D) \\frac{9}{11}",

To do this, we'll consider the possible behavior of a strictly convex function near the midpoint of the interval $(-2, 2)$, which is the point $(0, f(0))$.\n\nWe're given that $f(x)$ passes through the points $(-2, 5)$ and $(2, 9)$, so we can represent the function as:\n\n$f(x) = (x+2)*(9-5)$\n\nThis means that:\n\n$f(1) = (1+2)*(9-5) = 3*4 = 12$\n\nNow, considering the value at the midpoint of the interval(which is zero in this case), a strictly convex function has the property that from this midpoint, it must decrease monotonically. This means that for values closer to zero, $f(x)$ will decrease to $f(0) = 5$. The graph will then start to increase again at $x=0$ to encompass this behavior.\n\nSo, we expect that:\n\n$f(1) = f(-1) = 5$\n$f(2) = f(0) + f(3) = 5 + 9 = 14$\n$f(x) = (1+2)*(9-5) + 14*(x+2) = 5 + 14*x - 43$\n\nBut we know from the original information that $f(2) = 9$, so we can substitute this into the equation to find:\n\n$f(x) = 3*x - 3$\n\nNow we substitute $x=1$ in the equation to find the value of $f(1)$:\n\n$f(1) = 3*(1) - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0$\n\nSo, $f(1) = 0$.\n\nTo find the interval for all possible values of $f(1)$, we consider its behavior from the value $0$. Since a strictly convex function while strictly increasing from left to right, it will again decrease for negative values of $x$. So, $f(x) < 0$ for $x < 0$. Also, as it is strictly increasing, $f(-1) = 5$ and $f(-2) = 4$. Therefore, the interval containing all possible values for $f(1)$ is:\n\n$(0, 5)$\n\nThus the correct answer is:\n(A) (-inf, 10)",

This is to calculate the number of ways you can pick which two out of the remaining eligible rolls will be 6.\n\nNow, to calculate the probability of picking these specific two rolls, we need to multiply by the possibility of a 6 showing up on each of the 4 chosen rolls. So, it's 4C2 * 1/6 * 1/6.\n\nWe can calculate this probability using the combinations formula, or just by doing the actual multiplication: (4 choose 2) * (1/6)^2\n\n(4 choose 2) is equal to 6, since there are 4 choices to pick the roll on which the 6 will land, and to choose the second 6 roll from the remaining 3.\n\n(1/6)^2 tells us that there's 1 chance to get a 6 for each of the 2 rolls.\n\nSo, probability of getting exactly 2 6s = 6 * (1/6)^2 = 6 * (1/6)$ce) = 6/6 = 1\n\nNow, we want to find how many combinations of rolls that have at least 3 6s out of 5.\n\nThere are C(5, 3) ways to pick 3 non-6's out of the 5 rolls. Then, for each combination of 3 non 6's, all six possible outcomes are equally likely. This means there are a total of 5*6 ways to pick a combination of 3 non-6's and one more 6.\n\nThe probability of a 6 on any of the 5 rolls can be represented by 1/6, as there are 5 possible ways for a 6 to show up and each is equally likely. Therefore, the probability of getting a 6 in a specific roll out of 5 is 1/6.\n\nThe final probability, therefore, includes all the possible combinations of getting a 6 in 3, 4, or 5 rolls rather than just getting a 6 in 1 or 2 rolls.\n\nThus, to find the exact probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls, we need to subtract from this probability the other probabilities of getting a 6 in 3, 4, or 5 rolls:\n\nProbability of not getting at most 2 6s = Probability of getting at most 2 6s - Probability of getting at least 3 6s, or:\n\n(C) 6/6 - [(5*6)/(C(5, 3))] * 1/6^3\n\n=(6/6)-(5*6)\n\nTo find the rest of the work, simplify the expression and add parenthesis around the fractions when needed.\n\nThe answer is (C) \\frac{625}{648}.",
