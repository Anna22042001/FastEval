The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nGiven that the LCM of x and y divided by their GCD is 33, we can write the equation:\n\nLCM(x, y) = GCD(x, y) * 33\n\nSince the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both x and y, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx * y = GCD(x, y) * 33\n\nNow, we know that one of the integers is 45, so we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n45 * y = GCD(45, y) * 33\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest possible value of y. Since the GCD of 45 and y is the largest positive integer that divides both 45 and y without leaving a remainder, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n45 * y = GCD(45, y) * 33\n\nNow, we can factor out the GCD(45, y) from both sides of the equation:\n\nGCD(45, y) * (45 * y) = 33 * GCD(45, y)\n\nSince GCD(45, y) is the largest positive integer that divides both 45 and y without leaving a remainder, it must be a factor of both 45 and y. Therefore, GCD(45, y) must be 1, 3, 5, or 15.\n\nNow, we can substitute each possible value of GCD(45, y) into the equation:\n\n1 * (45 * y) = 33 * 1\n3 * (45 * y) = 33 * 3\n5 * (45 * y) = 33 * 5\n15 * (45 * y) = 33 * 15\n\nWe can see that the only solution is when GCD(45, y) = 3. In this case, y = 15.\n\nSo, the smallest possible value of the other integer (y) is 15.\n\nAnswer: (B) 46",

We can do this by finding the probability of each die showing a specific number and then multiplying the probabilities together:\n\nP(die 1 shows 1) * P(die 2 shows 2) * P(die 3 shows 3) = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216\n\nP(die 1 shows 2) * P(die 2 shows 3) * P(die 3 shows 4) = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216\n\nP(die 1 shows 3) * P(die 2 shows 4) * P(die 3 shows 5) = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216\n\nP(die 1 shows 4) * P(die 2 shows 5) * P(die 3 shows 6) = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216\n\nP(die 1 shows 5) * P(die 2 shows 6) * P(die 3 shows 1) = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216\n\nP(die 1 shows 6) * P(die 2 shows 1) * P(die 3 shows 2) = 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/216\n\nStep 5: Multiply the probabilities together.\nNow we can multiply the probabilities together to find the probability of $abc = 180$:\n\n1/216 * 1/216 * 1/216 * 1/216 * 1/216 * 1/216 * 1/216 = 1/72\n\nSo the probability of $abc = 180$ is:\n\n(B) \\frac{1}{72}",

            "model_answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles.\n2. The two piles had an equal number of pins.\n3. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\n4. John had 66 pins left.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information given:\n\n1. If the two piles had an equal number of pins, then each pile had 66 pins.\n2. John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.\n3. Since each pile had 66 pins, one-half of one pile would be 66/2 = 33 pins.\n4. One-third of one pile would be 33/3 = 11 pins.\n5. John gave his brother 33 - 11 = 22 pins.\n6. After giving away 22 pins, John had 66 - 22 = 44 pins left.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pins John originally had.\n\n7. John had 44 pins left after giving away 22 pins.\n8. To find the total number of pins John originally had, we add the 44 pins he had left to the 22 pins he gave away: 44 + 22 = 66 pins.\n\nSo, John originally had 66 pins. The answer is (B) 66.",
