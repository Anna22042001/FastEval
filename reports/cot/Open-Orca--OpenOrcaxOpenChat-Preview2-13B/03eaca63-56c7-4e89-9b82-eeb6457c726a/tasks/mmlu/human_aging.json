            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The study of older adults and aging is referred to as the multidisciplinary field that focuses on various aspects of older people's lives, such as health, social aspects, and psychological aspects. This field involves multiple disciplines (medicine, psychology, sociology, and demography) which together aim to improve the quality of life of older adults.\n\n1. Comparing the options given we can eliminate the ones that don't focus on the broad scope of the study:\n   (B) Geropsychiatry: focuses on psychiatric aspects in older adults.\n   (D) Gero-education: more focused on education and not the overall gerontological study.\n\n2. Now let's compare the remaining options:\n   (A) Gerontology: is focusing just on the study of aging and not on the multidisciplinary aspect it needs to contain.\n   (C) Geriatrics: focuses specifically on the health and medical aspect of older adults and doesn't cover all aspects like psychological, social, demographic view, etc.\n\n3. Considering the information now and the multidisciplinary nature of the field, the best fit for the study of older adults and aging would be the broader discipline that encompasses multiple aspects to provide a comprehensive outlook.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) Gerontology",

            "model_answer": "The step-by-step reasoning for this question is as follows:\n\n1. The docility hypothesis is a statement about the relationship between capability and environmental demands and their impact on an individual's behavior.\n2. Option (A) states that low-capability individuals are more vulnerable to environmental demands. The hypothesis should describe the vulnerability of those who face high demands, not low capability.\n3. Option (B) contradicts the idea of the docility hypothesis, as it suggests that high environmental demands would make individuals less docile. This statement goes against the main idea of the hypothesis.\n4. Option (C) seems close to the actual hypothesis, as it suggests that individuals who face high environmental demands become less docile because of the challenging conditions.\n5. Option (D) emphasizes the key factor of capability rather than the challenging conditions. However, it contradicts the main idea of the hypothesis as it suggests that less capability equates to less vulnerability.\n\nBased on the preceding reasoning and considering the original hypothesis, the answer to this question is:\n\n(C) Those who experience high environmental demands become less docile",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of these options could potentially improve normal memory, we should consider the evidence for and against each option.\n\n(A) Aerobic exercise:\n1. Studies have shown that regular exercise can improve brain function and cognition.\n2. Aerobic exercise is known to enhance blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain, which can facilitate memory formation and retention.\n3. Brain imaging studies have revealed that regular aerobic exercise leads to increased brain size and improved cognitive performance.\n\n(B) Taking acetylcholine:\n1. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays an essential role in cognitive function and memory processes.\n2. Although it is useful to enhance memory, gaining memory improvement by taking acetylcholine is not the same as enhancing one's normal memory.\n\n(C) Taking gingko:\n1. Ginkgo biloba is an herb that is often taken as a memory-enhancing supplement, but its effectiveness has not been conclusively proven.\n2. A few studies have indicated that gingko can improve cognitive function, but the results are mixed and not conclusive.\n\n(D) Increasing social contacts:\n1. Mental stimulation, social engagement and emotional well-being can support cognitive health and memory function.\n2. Numerous studies have linked social contacts to improved cognitive performance.\n\nAfter examining each option, it's reasonable to conclude that:\n\nThe best option for improving normal memory is:\n(A) Aerobic exercise",

Sociocultural factors, like the values, norms, and technologies that surround us, shape our development. This perspective suggests that development cannot be understood without examining how these sociocultural conditions play a role in shaping us.

The answer \"both play an important role\" is applicable as neither nature nor nurture has a blanket superiority.\n\n(B) Mechanistic vs organismic - In the realm of biology, this framework compares the study of cellular and molecular processes (mechanistic) versus the study of whole organisms (organismic). The answer \"both play an important role\" is not as applicable here, as mechanistic and organismic approaches are typically seen as opposing philosophies.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. discontinuity - In the fields of child development and psychology, continuity refers to the extent to which individual development stay consistent over time, while discontinuity implies a more abrupt change. The answer \"both play an important role\" is not as applicable here, as continuity and discontinuity are often regarded as contrasting ideas.\n\nThus, based on the reasoning above, the answer \"both play an important role\" is applicable to question (A) Nature vs. nurture.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we will go through each option and determine if it is usual as one grows older.\n\n(A) It becomes thicker: This is true, as the lens of the eye becomes thicker with age. This increase in thickness is a natural part of aging and is called presbyopia.\n\n(B) It yellows: This is partially true. The lens of the eye does contain a yellow substance called lipoprotein. However, the term \"yellows\" implies a noticeable change in the color of the lens.\n\n(C) It becomes clouded: This option is true. As one grows older, the lens of the eye may develop cloudy patches due to the accumulation of proteins called cataracts. This is a common effect of aging.\n\n(D) It fills with fluid: This option is not true. The lens is not filled with fluid as one grows older. Instead, its shape and structure change, causing the difficulties in vision we associate with aging.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the answer is:\n\n(B) It yellows",
