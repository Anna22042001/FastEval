            "model_answer": "Step 1: The problem states that Ms. Perez drove 40 miles in 5 days. This means that we need to find the average distance she drove per day. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the total duration in seconds. \nWe know that there are 365 days in a year, so a single day is 24 hours, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, making 3600 seconds in a day. Therefore, there are 365 * 3600 = 1304000 seconds in a year. Since we have 5 days, there are 1304000 / 5 = 260800 seconds in 5 days.\n\nStep 3: Clearly, 40 miles is a countable number, not time. Therefore, this will be 40 miles / 260800 seconds = 0.00015 miles per second, or 0.0015 miles per minute, or 0.015 miles per hour.\n\nStep 4: Now, we convert this into miles per day. \n8760 seconds in a day * 0.015 miles per second * 1 mile/1.609344 kilometers = 8.76 kilometers per day. Since 1 mile is equal to 1.609344 kilometers, Ms. Perez drove 8.76 kilometers per day. \n\nAnswer: (C) 8",
