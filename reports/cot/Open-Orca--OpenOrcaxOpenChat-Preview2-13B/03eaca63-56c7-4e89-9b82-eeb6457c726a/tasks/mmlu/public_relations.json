            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) Interpersonal\n\nInterpersonal communication is the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue. This is because interpersonal communication involves direct, face-to-face interactions between individuals, allowing for immediate feedback, clarification, and understanding. It also allows for the exchange of emotions and nonverbal cues, which can greatly influence the way a message is received and understood.\n\nIn contrast, media communication (B) can be less effective because it often relies on one-way communication, where the message is delivered without immediate feedback or interaction. Group communication (C) can be effective in some cases, but it can also be influenced by group dynamics and biases, which may not always lead to the most accurate or effective understanding of an issue. Public communication (D) can be effective in some cases, but it often relies on mass media and can be less personal and less effective in changing individual predispositions.\n\nAnswer: (A) Interpersonal",
