By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.

On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the context and time frame provided in the passage. The passage refers to Sukarno, an Indonesian leader, addressing the Bandung Conference. \n\nThe question asks us about one of the events Sukarno attempted to maintain a neutral stance in, but did not completely succeed. From the passage, it is clear that Sukarno was mainly focused on peace and urged the unification of Asia and Africa to maintain peace. \n\nConsidering this lead, we look at each of the four events:\n\nA) Arab-Israeli conflict \u2013 Sukarno would likely be involved in maintaining peace in the Middle East, but the text does not contradict that he might have maintained a neutral stance.\n\nB) Korean War \u2013 This a major event in 1950 that involved great regional alliances in Asia. Although the text does not mention the Korean War, it does not argue that Sukarno could not have maintained a neutral stance.\n\nC) The Cold War - This was a global confrontation between the Soviet Union and its satellite states on one side, and the United States and its allies on the other side. Sukarno's focus on maintaining peace and unity in Asia and Africa aligns with the context of the Cold War, but the text does not specifically mention the Cold War as the main focus of his neutral stance ambitions.\n\nD) Vietnam conflicts \u2013 These are a series of events in Vietnam from roughly 1955 to 1975 which were indebted to the global North-South political divides. Being from Asia and addressing the Bandung Conference, which was also an Asian event, Sukarno was likely concerned about preserving peace in Southeast Asia and could maintain a neutral stance here, but the text does not criticize his efforts of maintaining a neutral stance.\n\nBy analyzing each of the options, it becomes clear that the answer has to be (C) the Cold War. Sukarno's main focus in his keynote address at the Bandung Conference, especially in the context of their combined audience of over 1 billion people, was to prevent the Cold War from dominating the direction of developing nations.\n\nAnswer: (C) the Cold War.",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea.

Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
