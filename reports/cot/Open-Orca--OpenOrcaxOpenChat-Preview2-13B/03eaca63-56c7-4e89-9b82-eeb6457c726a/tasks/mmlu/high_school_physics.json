            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D).\n\nWhen the small block is placed on top of the original block, the system undergoes a perturbation. The spring-block oscillator is affected by two masses; m (the original block) and m (the added small block). The forces exerted by the system on these two masses need to be considered.\n\nFirst, let's think about the original (m) mass. The mass of the spring is about to displace back towards its equilibrium position. Since the spring is in compression, it exerts an upward spring force on the mass which can be calculated using Hooke's Law: F = -kx, where x is the displacement from equilibrium position, F is the force, k is the spring constant, and (m) is the mass.\n\nAs the mass moves, it rides on the surface due to the frictional force that limits how fast it can move. This force is given by Frict = \ud835\udf0fN, where N is the normal force to the surface, and \ud835\udf0f is the static friction coefficient.\n\nHowever, the added block (m) will also have an upward force due to the spring acting on it, and this would be equal to F' = -k'x, where the prime indicates the variables associated with the added mass.\n\nBut the key question is when the block is most likely to slide off as the system oscillates. This means the effective displacement of the block where the frictional force is overcome by its weight.\n\nIn this case, the equation of equilibrium will look like this: \nF' + mg = F\nSince mg = -k'x (assuming the spring force is constant, we don't need to add -kA/M in this step)\n\nSo, F' = F = -k'x\n\nAt equilibrium position, the spring is stretched just enough to counteract the force of gravity, F' = F = mg. So, x = (m+m)g/k'\n\nThe force responsible for movement, torque of frictional force and additional mass's upward force would be given by x = (m+m)g/k', x' = mg/k, and x' = x.\n\nCombining these torques, the equation for the relative position of a small mass relative to its equilibrium standpoint would be: (m+m)g/k' - mg/k = 0\n\nSimplifying, the equation can be written as: mg/(k'+k) = 0\n\nSince k' = k, mg/(k'+k) = mg/(k+k) = mg/(2k)\n\nThe probability of the added block sliding off becomes a function of the product of its mass with the spring constant and the gravitational force. Thus, if the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g / (kA), the added block will not slide off when the original block is at equilibrium position, which makes the correct option (D).",
