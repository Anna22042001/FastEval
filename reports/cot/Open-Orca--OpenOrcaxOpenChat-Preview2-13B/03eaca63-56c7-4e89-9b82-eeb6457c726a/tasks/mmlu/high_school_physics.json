            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following statements are true, we need to analyze the motion of the whiffle ball under the influence of air resistance.\n\n1. The ball's speed is zero at the highest point:\nAt the highest point, the ball's velocity is zero because it is at the top of its trajectory and has no horizontal component. However, its speed is not zero because it is still falling downward due to gravity.\n\n2. The ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point:\nAcceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Since the ball's velocity is zero at the highest point, its acceleration is also zero.\n\n3. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down:\nThe time taken for the ball to travel up to the highest point is longer than the time taken to fall back down because the ball has to overcome the force of gravity to reach the highest point. On the way down, gravity is working in the opposite direction, so the ball falls faster.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) I & II only",
