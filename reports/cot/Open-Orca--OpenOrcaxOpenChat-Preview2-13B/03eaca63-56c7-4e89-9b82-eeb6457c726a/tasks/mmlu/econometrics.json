It is a common metric used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasting models. The statement is true because MSE is highly correlated with trading rule profitability, as it penalizes large forecast errors more than small ones.\n\n(B) Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function.\nMean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. It is a simple and easy-to-interpret metric. However, it does not provide a quadratic loss function. The loss function for MAE is linear, as it penalizes both large and small forecast errors equally.\n\n(C) Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts.\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a measure of the average absolute percentage difference between the actual and predicted values. It is a useful metric for evaluating asset return forecasts, as it takes into account the relative size of the errors.\n\n(D) Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors.\nThis statement is true. Mean squared error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
