            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following countries is LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the availability of key resources such as energy, minerals, and water in each country.\n\n(A) United States: The United States has a diverse range of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, and various minerals. It is also a major producer of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric power, wind, and solar energy.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is an island nation with limited natural resources, but it has developed advanced technologies to utilize its resources efficiently. It has a strong focus on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.\n\n(C) France: France has a diverse range of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, and various minerals. It is also a major producer of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric power, wind, and solar energy.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has a diverse range of natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, uranium, and various minerals. It is also a major producer of renewable energy sources like hydroelectric power, wind, and solar energy.\n\nComparing the four countries, it is clear that Japan has the least self-sufficient natural resources for modern industry due to its limited land area and reliance on imported resources.\n\nAnswer: (B) Japan",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, we need to understand the theory and its main points.\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is a development theory that explains how economic growth and development in one region can lead to further growth and development in other regions. The theory is based on the idea that regions with initial advantages can attract labor, capital, and trade, which in turn leads to further growth and prosperity.\n\nNow let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\nThis statement aligns with the idea of regions with initial advantages attracting labor, capital, and trade, which leads to further growth and prosperity.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.\nThis statement contradicts the idea of regions with initial advantages attracting labor, capital, and trade, as it suggests that the core will always dominate the periphery, which is not the case in Myrdal's theory.\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\nThis statement also contradicts the idea of regions with initial advantages attracting labor, capital, and trade, as it suggests that the core's growth and prosperity comes at the expense of the periphery, which is not the case in Myrdal's theory.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\nThis statement aligns with the idea of regions with initial advantages attracting labor, capital, and trade, which leads to further growth and prosperity.\n\nBased on the analysis, the statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is:\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery.",
