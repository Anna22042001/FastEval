            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes are associated with (D) Humanistic Buddhism.\n\nReasoning:\n\n(A) Daoism is associated with the harmonious balance of opposites (like yin and yang) through nature and non-interference in the natural course of things. Although it has some aspects related to natural elements, it focuses mainly on principles governing the movement of the universe, the causes of existence and non-existence.\n\n(B) The Yin-Yang School, like Daoism, is more about balance, patterns, and the understanding of nature, but primarily as a means to achieve harmony and achieve self-cultivation. The school's focus lies more on human capabilities and the capacity for change than natural elements or processes.\n\n(C) Mengzi was a Confucian philosopher, and Confucianism revolves around the human relationship with tradition, behavior, and culture. Natural elements and processes are of lesser importance in Confucianism as compared to human interactions and moral development.\n\n(D) Humanistic Buddhism, on the other hand, is a divine form of Buddhism that strongly emphasizes the individual's connection with nature and the interdependent relationship between humans and the environment. It incorporates the belief of strong connections between humans, their conduct, and the natural ecosystem. This makes it the best fit to be associated with naturalists who concentrated on natural elements and processes.",
