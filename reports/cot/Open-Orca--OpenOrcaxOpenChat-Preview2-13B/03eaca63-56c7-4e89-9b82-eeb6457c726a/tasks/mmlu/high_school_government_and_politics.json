            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is true of appellate courts, let's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n(A) Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\nStare decisis is a legal principle that requires courts to follow precedents set by earlier decisions. Appellate courts do use this principle, as they review decisions made by lower courts and follow the precedents set by those decisions. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(B) Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\nAppellate courts are not involved in trials. They review decisions made by lower courts, which may or may not have involved jury trials. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(C) Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\nAppellate courts do not decide the facts of a case. They review the decisions made by lower courts, which are responsible for deciding the facts of a case. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\nAppellate courts do review decisions made by lower courts. They consider the legal arguments and precedents to determine if the lower court's decision was correct. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nAnswer: (D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.",

            "model_answer": "(B) White House Office\n\nReasoning:\nThe Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248 are both related to the organization and staffing of the executive branch of the United States government. The White House Office is a part of the executive branch and is responsible for supporting the President in their daily duties. Therefore, the President has the authority to select the staff for the White House Office through these two documents. The Peace Corps, Senate Committee on Appropriations, and Cabinet are not directly related to the President's staffing authority.",

Ferguson decision - This decision was in 1896 and upheld racial segregation, which was a result of the Dred Scott decision. So, it did not overturn the Dred Scott decision.\n\n(B) Missouri Compromise - This was a political agreement in 1820, not a legal decision. It was a compromise between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States. It did not overturn the Dred Scott decision.\n\n(C) Jim Crow laws - These were a series of state and local laws in the United States enacted between 1876 and 1965. They enforced racial segregation in public facilities. While they were a result of the Dred Scott decision, they did not overturn it.\n\n(D) Fourteenth Amendment - This amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1868. It granted citizenship to former slaves and their descendants and guaranteed them equal protection under the law. It overturned the Dred Scott decision, which had ruled that African Americans could not be considered citizens and therefore had no rights under the Constitution.\n\nSo, the Dred Scott decision of 1857 was overturned by the:\n\n(D) Fourteenth Amendment",

            "model_answer": "When the federal government provides most of the funding to a project in which multiple levels of government work together, the principle realized is:\n\n(B) Fiscal federalism\n\nReasoning:\nFiscal federalism is a principle that describes the distribution of financial resources and responsibilities between different levels of government. In this case, the federal government is providing most of the funding, which means that the distribution of financial resources is being managed by the federal government. This is in line with the concept of fiscal federalism, as it involves the allocation of financial resources among different levels of government.",
