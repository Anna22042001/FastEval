It suggests that as the working class becomes more affluent, they begin to adopt the cultural and social norms of the middle class. This is in contrast to the other options, which focus on changes in the class structure, the role of capitalists, or the impact of new technologies on the workplace.",

Instrumentally-rational action: This type of action is guided by the pursuit of specific, calculable goals. The actor seeks to maximize the probability of achieving these goals by using the most efficient means possible.\n\n2. Value-rational action: This type of action is guided by the pursuit of values or ideals. The actor seeks to achieve these values or ideals, regardless of the consequences or costs involved.\n\n3. Traditional action: This type of action is guided by the adherence to established customs, traditions, and norms. The actor follows these norms without questioning their validity or seeking to change them.\n\n4. Affectual action: This type of action is guided by emotions and feelings. The actor acts based on their emotional response to a situation, without considering the consequences or rationality of their actions.\n\nThe answer is:\n(B) affective",

However, this concept is not directly related to the proportion of housework men did.\n\n(B) While it is true that nagging from wives might encourage men to do more housework, this factor alone does not explain the greatest proportion of housework done by men.\n\n(C) The invention of exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron might have made housework more appealing to men, but it does not necessarily explain the greatest proportion of housework done by men.\n\n(D) Unemployment or both partners working full time could lead to more housework being done by men, as they have more time available. However, this factor alone does not explain the greatest proportion of housework done by men.\n\nBased on the information provided, the answer is:\n\n(D) they were unemployed or both partners worked full time",
