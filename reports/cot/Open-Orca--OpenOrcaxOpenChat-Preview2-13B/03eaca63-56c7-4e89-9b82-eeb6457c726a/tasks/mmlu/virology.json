            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for (A) Placebo effect.\n\nExplanation:\nRandomization helps to control for the placebo effect because it ensures that the treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of baseline characteristics and potential confounders. This helps to minimize the impact of the placebo effect on the study results.\n\nRecall bias can be controlled by using validated and standardized questionnaires, while non-compliance can be addressed by monitoring adherence to the study protocol and using appropriate statistical methods to account for missing data. Effect modification (interaction) can be controlled by including appropriate covariates in the statistical analysis.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The special feature of adaptive immunity is:\n\n(B) Ability to distinguish self and non self\n\nReasoning:\nAdaptive immunity is a type of immunity that involves the production of antibodies and memory cells. These cells are able to recognize and respond to specific foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. The ability to distinguish self from non-self is crucial for adaptive immunity, as it prevents the immune system from attacking the body's own cells and tissues. This is achieved through the recognition of specific antigens on the surface of foreign substances, which are not present on the body's own cells.\n\nThe other options are not as specific to adaptive immunity:\n(A) Speed of response to a foreign protein - While adaptive immunity is generally faster than innate immunity, this is not a unique feature of adaptive immunity.\n(C) Ability to distinguish viruses and bacteria - While adaptive immunity can distinguish between different types of pathogens, this is not a unique feature of adaptive immunity.\n(D) Short memory - This is not a feature of adaptive immunity, as it is the innate immune system that has a short memory. Adaptive immunity has a long-lasting memory through the formation of memory cells.",
