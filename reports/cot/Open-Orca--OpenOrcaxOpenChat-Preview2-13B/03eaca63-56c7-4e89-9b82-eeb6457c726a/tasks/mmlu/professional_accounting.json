If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "We need to calculate the estimated yearly yield on the limousine investment. To do this, we will calculate the expected hire income and substract the estimated daily expenses to get the net income per day. After that, we will divide the yearly net income by the initial investment in order to get the percentage return.\n\nStep 1: Estimated Hire Income \n- Calculate the hourly income: $245/hour\n- Calculate the daily income: $245 * 2 hours/day = $490\n\nStep 2: Daily Expenses\n- Calculate daily total expenses, including $50 daily costs: $50 + $98,000 = 98,050\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Daily Net Income\n- Calculate the daily net income from the hire income: $490 - $50 = $440\n\nStep 4: Calculate the Annual Net Income\n- Calculate the annual net income by multiplying the daily net income by 365 (days in a year) = $440/day * 365 days = $162,200\n\nStep 5: Calculate the Percentage Return (Yearly Yield)\n- Divide the annual net income by the initial investment: $162,200 / $98,000 = 1.6502\n- Round the result to 4 decimal places: 1.6502 \u2248 1.6498 (using 4 decimal places)\n- Divide the rounded result by 100: 1.6498 \u2248 (B) 1.64%\n\nOutput: (B) 1.64%",

            "question": "Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end. However the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. What effect did the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise have on Arno's balance sheet at year end? Assets Liabilities\n\n(A) No effect No effect\n(B) No effect Understated\n(C) Understated No effect\n(D) Understated Understated",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise will have an understated effect on Arno's balance sheet at year end.\n\nStep 1: At year-end, a physical inventory is taken and counts all of the merchandise in stock. Since the credit purchase was not recorded in the books, the inventory value included in the balance sheet would be lower than the actual value at the cost of the merchandise, resulting in an understated amount.\n\nStep 2: Let's consider the effects on both the assets and liabilities side for better understanding. In this scenario, assets should include the merchandise inventory. Since Arno Co. did not report the purchase in the records, it's undervalued. This understated merchandise will lead to a smaller total value of assets in the balance sheet. On the liabilities side, since the merchandise was not recorded as a purchase, there is no additional liability associated with it.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The effect on the balance sheet due to the omission of the merchandise purchase is understated, both for assets and liabilities. Hence, the final answer is:\n\n(C) Understated No effect",

The question asks about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer.\n2. A confirms that sampling risk arises because of restricting a substantive test to a sample, which could lead to different conclusions.\n3. B mentions nonsampling risk arising from auditor's inability to recognize misstatements, but it is not specific to a nonissuer.\n4.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate procedure, let's consider the role of an auditor and their responsibilities related to subsequent events:\n\n1. Auditors are responsible for obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements due to fraud or error.\n2. Subsequent events are events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end.\n- This could involve assessing whether these inventory items should be included in the year-end inventory or in the subsequent period. Undelivered orders shouldn't affect the year-end financial statements if these inventory items shouldn't be included in the financial statements.\n\n(B) Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate.\n- The auditor's job is to verify if the reported inadequate internal control activities are still a concern. If not, these activities don't qualify as subsequent events. If so, the auditor will check for the effectiveness of implemented corrective actions.\n\n(C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n- The auditor may examine cutoff bank statements if the company has a practice to not include the subsequent period's transactions in the current year's financial statements. This ensures that they include the appropriate statements in their financial analysis.\n\n(D) Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.\n- The auditor compares the latest interim financial statements with the year-end financial statements and evaluates consistency and correctness based on prior period disclosures. This helps identify any material misstatements or discrepancies in the financial statements.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the most appropriate subsequent event-related procedure for an auditor is (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.",

Bond carrying amount: The bond carrying amount is represented by the bond's par value (original face value of the bond) plus the remaining accrued discount (premium) if positive. Since the error is in amortization, the accrued premium would be lower than it should be, resulting in an incorrect bond carrying amount.\n\n2. Retained earnings and earnings: Each coupon payment would affect the retained earnings and earnings similarly.
