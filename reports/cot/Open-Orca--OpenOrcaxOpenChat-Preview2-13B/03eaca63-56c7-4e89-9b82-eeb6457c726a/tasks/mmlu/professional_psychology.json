            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the stages of the Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model proposed by Atkinson, Morten, and Sue (1993).\n\n1. Encounter: In this stage, individuals are exposed to different cultures and begin to recognize their own cultural identity.\n2. Dissonance: In this stage, individuals experience a sense of discomfort or conflict between their own cultural identity and the dominant culture.\n3. Integrative Awareness: In this stage, individuals begin to develop a sense of self-awareness and understanding of their own cultural identity.\n4. Introspection: In this stage, individuals question their rejection of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture.\n5. Immersion/Emersion: In this stage, individuals fully immerse themselves in the dominant culture or embrace their own culture.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Encounter: This stage is about recognizing different cultures, not questioning rejection of the dominant culture.\n(B) Dissonance: This stage is about experiencing discomfort or conflict between one's own cultural identity and the dominant culture, not questioning rejection of the dominant culture.\n(C) Integrative Awareness: This stage is about developing self-awareness and understanding of one's own cultural identity, not questioning rejection of the dominant culture.\n(D) Introspection: This stage is about questioning one's rejection of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Introspection",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to analyze each option and determine which one is the most accurate.\n\n(A) may produce its effects by promoting the release of endogenous opiates-dorphins)\n- This option suggests that electrical stimulation of the brain may release endogenous opiates (such as dorphins) to alleviate chronic pain. This is a plausible explanation, as opiates are known to have analgesic properties.\n\n(B) may produce its effects by promoting the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine\n- This option suggests that electrical stimulation of the brain may release norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter involved in the fight-or-flight response. While norepinephrine can have analgesic properties, it is not the primary neurotransmitter associated with pain relief.\n\n(C) is generally effective, but medically ill-advised because such stimulation has aversive properties\n- This option suggests that electrical stimulation of the brain is generally effective in treating chronic pain but is medically ill-advised due to its aversive properties. This statement is not clear and does not provide enough information to determine the effectiveness of electrical stimulation.\n\n(D) is of no practical significance, since stimulation-produced analgesia has been demonstrated only in rats\n- This option suggests that electrical stimulation of the brain is not practical for treating chronic pain in humans because it has only been demonstrated to work in rats. This statement is not accurate, as electrical stimulation of the brain has been used in humans for various purposes, including pain relief.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most accurate answer is:\n\n(A) may produce its effects by promoting the release of endogenous opiates-dorphins)",
