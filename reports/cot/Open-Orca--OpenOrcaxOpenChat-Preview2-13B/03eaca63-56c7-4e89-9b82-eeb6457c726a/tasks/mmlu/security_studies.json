            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) The responsibility to prevent: This principle refers to taking actions to prevent or avert situations that might lead to large-scale violence against peoples. This is an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(B) The responsibility to react: This principle refers to taking appropriate actions when emergencies or situations of large-scale violence against peoples occur. This is also an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\n(C) The responsibility to remain sovereign: Sovereignty is a principle that states that each nation governs itself and has autonomy over its affairs. This principle is not related to the responsibility to protect, as it emphasizes nation-states' independence, whereas the responsibility to protect interferes in situations that require international intervention. While nation-states are responsible for protecting their people, the sovereignty of the nation should not be a barrier to the responsibility to protect in extreme cases.\n\n(D) The responsibility to rebuild: This principle pertains to rebuilding after situations of large-scale violence against peoples. It is another element of the responsibility to protect.\n\nAnswer: (C)The responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n\nReasoning:\nThe liberal perspective on energy security would likely emphasize the interconnectedness of the global economy, meaning that the well-being of one country is dependent on the well-being of others. Since all core powers have the same interests in maintaining stability and free-market trading, it's unlikely that they would engage in conflict over energy sources.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Human security is neo-colonial: This criticism points out that the human security framework may be biased or serving the interests of certain powerful nations. It suggests that the human security approach, rather than being truly inclusive or universally relevant, may be catering primarily to the needs and priorities of these powerful nations at the expense of weaker or less influential ones.\n\n(B) Human security promotes global capitalism: This criticism argues that the human security concept ultimately serves the interests of global capitalism, in which major issues like poverty, inequality, and environmental destruction that could potentially threaten national and global security are ignored as opportunities for further economic growth.\n\n(C) Human security is too broad: This critique typically comes from those who believe that human security is an overly ambitious and unruly concept due to its broad approach. It may include too many different forms of security (such as individual, community, societal, and even global security). This diversity allows for a variety of interpretations, leading to confusion and greater difficulty in implementing policies.\n\n(D) All of the options: There are valid criticisms of human security that cover aspects of its politics, economic intentions, and theoretical scope.\n\nAfter analyzing and evaluating these options, it can be seen that options (A) and (B) are common criticisms of the human security concept. Option (C) is more of a concern with implementation and understanding of the concept, but is also related to its critique. Human security is a complex and multifaceted concept, so any of these issues could potentially be potential critiques.\n\nSo the answer is (D) All of these options.",

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.
