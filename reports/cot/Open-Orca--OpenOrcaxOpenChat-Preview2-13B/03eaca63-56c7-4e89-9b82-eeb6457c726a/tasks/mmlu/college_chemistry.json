            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider the nuclear shell model. The nuclear shell model is a model that describes the arrangement of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. It is based on the idea that the nucleus can be divided into a series of concentric shells, with each shell having a specific energy level.\n\nThe number of energy levels in a nucleus is determined by the number of protons (Z) and the number of neutrons (N). The total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) is given by the atomic mass number (A).\n\nFor 55Mn, we have:\nZ = 25 (protons)\nN = 30 (neutrons)\nA = 55 (atomic mass number)\n\nNow, we need to find the number of energy levels that can be accommodated by the nucleus. According to the nuclear shell model, the energy levels are given by the following formula:\n\nEnergy levels = (Z^2 - N^2) / 2A\n\nFor 55Mn, we have:\nEnergy levels = (25^2 - 30^2) / 2 * 55\nEnergy levels = (625 - 900) / 110\nEnergy levels = -275 / 110\nEnergy levels = -2.5\n\nSince the energy levels are not whole numbers, we cannot have a complete set of energy levels. Therefore, the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide is:\n\n(A) 3",
