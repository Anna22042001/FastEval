No element (other than the identity) is its own inverse.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of G.\n\nSince G contains a subgroup of order seven, we know that G has a subgroup of size 7. This means that G has at least 7 elements.\n\nHowever, we are also given that no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse. This means that the order of G cannot be a prime number greater than 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of G that are less than or equal to 7:\n\n1. 1 (trivial group)\n2. 2 (cyclic group of order 2)\n3. 3 (cyclic group of order 3)\n4. 4 (cyclic group of order 4)\n5. 5 (cyclic group of order 5)\n6. 6 (cyclic group of order 6)\n7. 7 (cyclic group of order 7)\n\nWe can eliminate the trivial group (order 1) and the cyclic groups of order 2, 3, 4, and 5 because they have elements that are their own inverses.\n\nThis leaves us with the cyclic group of order 6 and 7.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible orders of G that are greater than 7:\n\n8. 8 (cyclic group of order 8)\n9. 9 (cyclic group of order 9)\n10. 10 (cyclic group of order 10)\n11. 11 (cyclic group of order 11)\n12. 12 (cyclic group of order 12)\n13. 13 (cyclic group of order 13)\n14. 14 (cyclic group of order 14)\n15. 15 (cyclic group of order 15)\n16. 16 (cyclic group of order 16)\n17. 17 (cyclic group of order 17)\n18. 18 (cyclic group of order 18)\n19. 19 (cyclic group of order 19)\n20. 20 (cyclic group of order 20)\n21. 21 (cyclic group of order 21)\n22. 22 (cyclic group of order 22)\n23. 23 (cyclic group of order 23)\n24. 24 (cyclic group of order 24)\n25. 25 (cyclic group of order 25)\n26. 26 (cyclic group of order 26)\n27. 27 (cyclic group of order 27)\n28. 28 (cyclic group of order 28)\n29. 29 (cyclic group of order 29)\n30. 30 (cyclic group of order 30)\n31. 31 (cyclic group of order 31)\n32. 32 (cyclic group of order 32)\n33. 33 (cyclic group of order 33)\n34. 34 (cyclic group of order 34)\n35. 35 (cyclic group of order 35)\n36. 36 (cyclic group of order 36)\n37. 37 (cyclic group of order 37)\n38. 38 (cyclic group of order 38)\n39. 39 (cyclic group of order 39)\n40. 40 (cyclic group of order 40)\n41. 41 (cyclic group of order 41)\n42. 42 (cyclic group of order 42)\n43. 43 (cyclic group of order 43)\n44. 44 (cyclic group of order 44)\n45. 45 (cyclic group of order 45)\n46. 46 (cyclic group of order 46)\n47. 47 (cyclic group of order 47)\n48. 48 (cyclic group of order 48)\n49. 49 (cyclic group of order 49)\n50. 50 (cyclic group of order 50)\n51. 51 (cyclic group of order 51)\n52. 52 (cyclic group of order 52)\n53. 53 (cyclic group of order 53)\n54. 54 (cyclic group of order 54)\n55. 55 (cyclic group of order 55)\n56. 56 (cyclic group of order 56)\n57. 57 (cyclic group of order 57)\n58. 58 (cyclic group of order 58)\n59. 59 (cyclic group of order 59)\n60. 60 (cyclic group of order 60)\n61. 61 (cyclic group of order 61)\n62. 62 (cyclic group of order 62)\n63. 63 (cyclic group of order 63)\n64. 64 (cyclic group of order 64)\n65. 65 (cyclic group of order 65)\n66. 66 (cyclic group of order 66)\n67. 67 (cyclic group of order 67)\n68. 68 (cyclic group of order 68)\n69. 69 (cyclic group of order 69)\n70. 70 (cyclic group of order 70)\n71. 71 (cyclic group of order 71)\n72. 72 (cyclic group of order 72)\n73. 73 (cyclic group of order 73)\n74. 74 (cyclic group of order 74)\n75. 75 (cyclic group of order 75)\n76. 76 (cyclic group of order 76)\n77. 77 (cyclic group of order 77)\n78. 78 (cyclic group of order 78)\n79. 79 (cyclic group of order 79)\n80. 80 (cyclic group of order 80)\n81. 81 (cyclic group of order 81)\n82. 82 (cyclic group of order 82)\n83. 83 (cyclic group of order 83)\n84. 84 (cyclic group of order 84)\n85. 85 (cyclic group of order 85)\n86. 86 (cyclic group of order 86)\n87. 87 (cyclic group of order 87)\n88. 88 (cyclic group of order 88)\n89. 89 (cyclic group of order 89)\n90. 90 (cyclic group of order 90)\n91. 91 (cyclic group of order 91)\n92. 92 (cyclic group of order 92)\n93. 93 (cyclic group of order 93)\n94. 94 (cyclic group of order 94)\n95. 95 (cyclic group of order 95)\n96. 96 (cyclic group of order 96)\n97. 97 (cyclic group of order 97)\n98. 98 (cyclic group of order 98)\n99. 99 (cyclic group of order 99)\n100. 100 (cyclic group of order 100)\n101. 101 (cyclic group of order 101)\n102. 102 (cyclic group of order 102)\n103. 103 (cyclic group of order 103)\n104. 104 (cyclic group of order 104)\n105. 105 (cyclic group of order 105)\n106. 106 (cyclic group of order 106)\n107. 107 (cyclic group of order 107)",
