A triangle is composed of 3 interior angles that sum to 180\u00b0. Each interior angle of a triangle is equal to (180-angle between two smaller segments)/2.\n\n3. The angles between two smaller segments, AB, A\"B and A\u00f4leak B\u00f4leak, need to be less than 180\u00b0 so the three smaller segments could form the sides of a triangle.

The probability that none of them is 60\u00b0 is represented by the complement of that event, which is defined by a conditional probability.\n\n6. If no given angle is 60\u00b0, one angle is necessarily less than 60\u00b0 and the other two angles must be greater than 60\u00b0. This means that the opposite angles of the two angles greater than 60\u00b0 have equal angle, which is also between 60\u00b0 and 180\u00b0.\n\n7. Each segment in a triangle forms two angles, so there are six angles to consider. Conditional probability is calculated by dividing the desired event by the total number of possible outcomes.
