            "question": "If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room then\n\n(A) GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.\n(C) GDP is unaffected because it is a second hand sale.\n(D) GI)P decreases because I decreases.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the effect of XYZ Corporation buying an original Matisse painting on GDP, we need to consider the components of GDP:\n\nGDP = C (Consumption) + I (Investment) + G (Government Spending) + (X - M) (Net Exports)\n\nNow let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. XYZ Corporation buys the painting, which is a form of investment (I).\n2. The painting is an original work of art, so it is a durable good.\n3. The painting is bought for the board room, which means it will be used for a long time.\n4. The painting is an asset, so it will be depreciated over time.\n\nSince the painting is an investment and it is a durable good, it will contribute to the GDP. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.",

While recessions can be severe, they are not always as severe as depressions. Depressions are typically more severe and long-lasting than recessions.\n\n(C) are marked by a sustained decline in output: This statement is accurate. Recessions are characterized by a sustained decline in economic output, which can last for several months or even years.\n\n(D) are regular occurrences in capitalist economies: This statement is also accurate. Recessions are a regular occurrence in capitalist economies, as they are part of the business cycle.

This happens because when the government increases its spending, it needs to borrow more money from the private sector. As a result, the demand for loans increases, causing interest rates to rise. This makes it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow money, which can lead to a decrease in private investment and consumption.",
