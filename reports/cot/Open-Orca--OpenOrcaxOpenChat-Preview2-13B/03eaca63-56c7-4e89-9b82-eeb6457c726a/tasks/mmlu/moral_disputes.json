            "model_answer": "Philippa Foot explains the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction by appealing to:\n\n(C) both A and B\n\nReasoning:\nPhilippa Foot's explanation of the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction is based on the idea that there is a difference between actively causing harm (killing) and passively allowing harm to occur (letting die). This distinction is important because it highlights the moral obligations we have towards others.\n\nIn this context, the rights of noninterference (A) and rights to goods and services (B) are both relevant. The rights of noninterference refer to the idea that we should not interfere with the lives of others unless it is necessary to prevent harm. This principle is related to the distinction between killing and letting die, as it suggests that we should not actively cause harm but also should not passively allow harm to occur if we have the ability to prevent it.\n\nOn the other hand, the rights to goods and services (B) are also relevant because they emphasize the importance of providing assistance and support to those in need. This principle is also connected to the distinction between killing and letting die, as it suggests that we should not only refrain from causing harm but also actively work to provide assistance and support to those who are in need.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) both A and B, as both principles are relevant to understanding the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction.",

            "question": " Against Kant's view of sexual objectification, Papadaki argues that\n\n(A) it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity.\n(B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.\n(C) sexual objectification actually enhances humanity.\n(D) Papadaki actually agrees with Kant's view",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand Kant's view of sexual objectification and Papadaki's argument against it.\n\nKant's view of sexual objectification is that it is morally wrong because it treats people as mere objects for sexual pleasure, rather than as autonomous individuals with inherent dignity and worth. This view is based on the idea that human beings have a unique capacity for rationality and moral agency, which should be respected and not exploited for the sake of sexual gratification.\n\nNow, let's examine Papadaki's argument against Kant's view:\n\n(A) Papadaki does not argue that it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity. Instead, she argues against Kant's view that sexual objectification is morally wrong because it treats people as mere objects for sexual pleasure.\n\n(B) Papadaki does not agree with Kant's view that the wrong of sexual objectification should be understood in terms of humanity. Instead, she argues that sexual objectification can be morally wrong for other reasons, such as violating the autonomy and dignity of the individuals involved.\n\n(C) Papadaki does not argue that sexual objectification actually enhances humanity. Instead, she argues that sexual objectification can be morally wrong for reasons other than the degradation of humanity.\n\n(D) Papadaki does not agree with Kant's view. Instead, she argues against it, suggesting that sexual objectification can be morally wrong for reasons other than the degradation of humanity.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Papadaki argues that Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which approach Sandel's case against moral engineering best aligns with, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) A Kantian approach: Immanuel Kant's ethical theory is based on the idea of treating others as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end. It emphasizes the importance of rationality, autonomy, and duty. While Sandel's case against moral engineering may touch upon some of these themes, it does not seem to be primarily focused on Kant's specific ideas.\n\n(B) An application of the ethics of prima facie duty: This approach, developed by W.D. Ross, focuses on the idea that there are certain duties that are prima facie (on the face of it) obligatory, and that these duties can be overridden by other duties. While Sandel's case against moral engineering may involve discussing the potential conflicts between different duties, it does not seem to be primarily focused on this specific approach.\n\n(C) A virtue ethics approach: Virtue ethics, as developed by Aristotle, focuses on the development of virtues (such as courage, justice, and temperance) as the foundation for a good life. While Sandel's case against moral engineering may touch upon some of these themes, it does not seem to be primarily focused on virtue ethics.\n\n(D) A natural law theory approach: Natural law theory, as developed by Thomas Aquinas and others, is based on the idea that there are certain moral principles that are inherent in human nature and can be discovered through reason. While Sandel's case against moral engineering may involve discussing the potential limitations of moral engineering in light of human nature, it does not seem to be primarily focused on natural law theory.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the best approach to consider Sandel's case against moral engineering is:\n\n(C) a virtue ethics approach.",
