            "question": "For Socrates, an unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to _____.\n\n(A) the state\n(B) the justice system\n(C) the body\n(D) the soul",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's dissect Socrates' famous statement: \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" This implies that a life without proper examination and reflection has little value. To understand why an unexamined life is a tragedy, we have to look at Socrates' philosophy of the soul.\n\nSocrates emphasized that humans have an immortal soul, which is separate from the body and separates from it upon death. The role of the soul is to seek for wisdom and virtue. When the soul is engaged in such pursuits, it becomes more likely for humans to achieve a satisfied and peaceful existence in this life and in the afterlife.\n\nNow, considering Socrates' view of the soul, let's analyze the four options for the harm that an unexamined life results in:\n\n(A) the state - the state was never a priority or concern for Socrates. He focused primarily on individual soul development.\n(B) the justice system - Socrates didn't give much attention to the justice system, he was predominantly focused on issues of ethics, virtue, and the importance of an inner examination of oneself.\n(C) the body - While it might be a part of Socrates' life, it doesn't seem to be the main focus or the aspect of harm in an unexamined life.\n(D) the soul - the lack of examined life in Socrates' philosophy directly negatively impacts the soul.\n\nTaking into account Socrates' focus on the soul's need for reflection and examination, it is clear that an unexamined life leads to harm to the soul as it prevents it from achieving its ultimate goal- attaining wisdom and virtue.\n\nAnswer: (D) the soul",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "We want to find out what Plato's view on true beauty is. To do this, we will analyze his views on aesthetics. Plato was a philosopher from ancient Greece who believed in the existence of \"The Forms\" or the Ideal, which according to him is perfect and pure, and forms the basis of our knowledge.\n\nStep 1: Consider Plato's view on form\nPlato believed in \"The Form of Beauty\". He thought there was an Ideal Beauty that exists apart from the everyday things we perceive as beautiful, which are only imperfect reflections of the absolute form of beauty.\n\nStep 2: Compare with the given options\n(A) found in everyday objects: This option contradicts Plato's view, as he believed beauty is an ideal separate from everyday objects.\n(B) nonexistent: This is not likely because Plato believed in the existence of the Ideal.\n(C) everywhere in the natural world: Although Plato did acknowledge the \"divine rows\" of uniforms in nature, he believed beauty can exist only when it mirrors the true form.\n(D) not of this world: The word \"not\" implies the negation of its statement - it seems more fitting to the belief of the Ideal Beauty's existence apart from what we perceive as reality.\n\nStep 3: Output the answer\nThe answer is (D) not of this world.",

This means the individual is lacking the knowledge that their action(s) are against what is morally or ethically correct.\n\nOption B: This option is about both the individual knowing their actions are wrong and acting on them as well. This option has both the elements of knowledge and action despite knowing it's wrong.\n\nOption C: This option mainly talks about the individual knowing their feelings are wrong, but they themselves don't act on their feelings. This confines the 'knowledge' aspect to feelings only and does not involve action.\n\nOption D: This option discusses the right action being taken for the wrong reason. Doing right is there, but the individual's motivation or intention to do so is wrong.\n\nAnswer: Comparing all options with Aristotle's definition of incontinence, it becomes clear that option B matches the criterion best.

This implies that he sees skeptical arguments as being unreasonable, excessive or harsh in their approach.

The answer should also be in line with Socrates' beliefs about the soul.\n\nComparing the given options:\n\n(A) knowledge - According to Socrates, knowledge was integral for the development of virtue and wisdom.

However, he did not view community as necessary for a harmonious and well-developed soul.\n\n(D) courage - Socrates considered courage as one of the virtues that were necessary for an individual to have a harmonious soul.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(A) knowledge",

The Categorical Imperative argues that we should only act in such a way that, if everyone were to follow that same rule, it would still produce a just society. This 'universalizability' test forms the basis of Kant's moral philosophy.
