            "model_answer": "A type-Ia supernova occurs when a white dwarf star pulls in matter from a nearby companion star, such as a normal star or another white dwarf, until it becomes overloaded and explodes.\n\nNow, let's analyze all the options:\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems.\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies.\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts.\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays.\n\nFirst, let's consider binary systems. Type-Ia supernovae do occur in binary systems, but we cannot be 100% sure that they always occur in binary systems because there might be cases where a single stellar system leads to a type-Ia supernova. Therefore, I cannot confidently say that the answer is (A) based on the information given.\n\nThen, let's look at young galaxies. Young galaxies are usually more active due to continuous star formation and other interstellar processes. While it's possible that type-Ia supernovae might occur in young galaxies more frequently due to the higher number of forming stars, the truth is, they can also happen in other, older galaxies. Therefore, we cannot decisively say that the answer is (B), even though it is possible.\n\nNow, regarding gamma-ray bursts, which are the brightest explosions in the universe, it is not true that type-Ia supernovae produce them. On the contrary, gamma-ray bursts can only be produced by the extreme gravitational collapse of massive stars, leaving nothing behind. Thus, the answer cannot be (C).\n\nLastly, consider X-ray production. Type-Ia supernovae are primarily characterized by the emission of more visible light and infrared radiation rather than X-rays. This is because the energy from their explosion comes from the release of light and high-energy particles like gamma rays. Hence, these supernovae tend to emit less in terms of X-rays compared to other methods of producing the frequency. Consequently, the answer cannot be (D).\n\nThus, out of the options A, B, C, and D, none of them satisfactorily answers the question about the true nature of a type-Ia (\"type one-a\") supernova.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, we need to understand what each option means and how it relates to the given information.\n\n(A) Its speed relative to you: Speed refers to how fast an object is moving relative to you. Since we only have information about the object's brightness, we cannot determine its speed.So, the answer is (A) NO.\n\n(B) Its composition: Composition describes the substances or materials that make up an object. Since we are given only the brightness information, we cannot determine the composition of the object. So, the answer is (B) NO.\n\n(C) Its size: Size refers to the extent or magnitude of an object's physical dimensions. Although brightness could be used indirectly to infer the size of an object (brighter objects are usually larger), this information is not sufficient to precisely estimate the size. So, the answer is (C) NO.\n\n(D) Its distance from you: The distance of an object from a certain position is how far it is from that position. By knowing both its apparent brightness and its actual brightness, we can estimate the distance from the observer using the inverse square law. If the actual brightness is known, the object's distance can be calculated by measuring the amount of decrease in brightness due to the inverse square law and the distance can be half of this value (hypotenuse of a right angle triangle). So, the observed brightness (distance-dependent) is lesser than the actual brightness.\n\nAnswer: (D) YES.",

When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue light gets scattered more as it interacts with the particles, making the sky look blue.\n\n(D) The Earth's atmosphere does not preferentially absorb all other colors.

This means that the impact energy equals the change in the Earth's kinetic energy due to the collision, which itself equals the change in the Earth's velocity.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the energy expression derived from Step 2\nSince the comet and the Earth have the same mass (M = m, since they are two objects), the problem simplifies to:\nv\u00b2 = 2*G*M*R / R\n\nStep 4: Simplifying the expression\nThe desired answer should be the energy when expressed in terms of the comet's mass, so when the expression above is looked at, we neglect the mass of the Earth because it is the same as that of the comet. Therefore, the expression reduces to:\nv\u00b2 = G*m*R\n\nStep 5: Noting the impact condition\nIsolate the comet's velocity v from the expression: In order to get minimum kinetic energy from the impact, which implies minimum speed, so the minimum impact speed is calculated as:\nv_{\\rm min} = \\sqrt{G*m*R}\n\nStep 6: Rearranging to properly formulate the answer\nNow, we put v*v = v^2 from Step 3 to the expression above and rearrange the equation:\n(1/2)m*v^2 = (1/2)G*m*R\n\nStep 7: Solving for the energy released\nSince speed is given in terms of volume, change the root:\nE = (1/2)m*(v^2) = (1/2)m*(v*v) = (1/2)m*v^2\n\nStep 8: Output the final answer\n\nThe total energy released in the impact is (1/2)m*v^2.
