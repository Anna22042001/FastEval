How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand how our eyes perceive objects in the sky.\n\nThe angular resolution of our eyes is the smallest angle at which we can distinguish two separate objects. This is determined by the size of our pupils and the density of our retinas.\n\nNow, let's consider the situation where the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes. In this case, our eyes will not be able to distinguish the two stars as separate objects. Instead, they will appear as a single point of light.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.\n\nExplanation:\nEarth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core. The combination of a partially molten metallic core and a reasonably rapid rotation creates a dynamo effect, which generates the strong magnetic field. The other options do not directly relate to the generation of Earth's magnetic field.",

This was because he believed that the planets moved in epicycles, which are smaller circular orbits within larger circular orbits.
