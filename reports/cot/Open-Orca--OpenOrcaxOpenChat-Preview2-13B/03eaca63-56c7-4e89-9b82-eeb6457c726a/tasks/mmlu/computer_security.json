It is not a fuzz testing tool, a map of the Internet, or a suite of tools for scripting attacks. However, it does use probes, constructs, encodes, injects, and waits for responses as part of its scanning process.",

It was not a buffer overflow attack but rather a malware that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook.\n\n(B) SQL Slammer - SQL Slammer was a worm that exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server and caused widespread disruption in January 2003. It was not the first buffer overflow attack, but it was one of the most significant ones.\n\n(C) Morris Worm - The Morris Worm was a computer worm that spread through the Internet in November 1988.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) No string boundary checks in predefined functions\n\nApps developed in languages like C and C++ are prone to buffer overflow because they often use predefined functions that do not perform string boundary checks. This means that when a program tries to store a string into a buffer, it may not check if the buffer is large enough to hold the entire string. If the buffer is too small, the program will attempt to write past the end of the buffer, overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as corrupting data or causing the program to crash.",

            "model_answer": "A buffer overflow occurs when a program attempts to store more data in a buffer than it was allocated to hold. This can happen when a program reads or writes data to a buffer without properly checking its size. When this happens, the extra data can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting important data structures or code.\n\nIn the context of running attacker-injected code, a buffer overflow can be exploited by an attacker to gain control over the program's execution. This is done by overwriting the return address, which is a crucial piece of information that tells the program where to resume execution after it has finished executing a function.\n\nWhen a buffer overflow occurs, the attacker-injected code can overwrite the return address with a value that points to the attacker's code. When the program tries to return from the function, it will instead execute the attacker's code, allowing the attacker to run their code on the target system.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code",
