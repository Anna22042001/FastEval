            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine which fuzzer style is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program, let's examine each style:\n\n(A) Generational: Generational fuzzers focus on creating new offspring by mutating the input and testing it against the program. This can often result in new paths being explored, but there may be some limitations when it comes to covering every line of code. Since the mutations might not consistently cover different parts of the code.\n\n(B) Blackbox: Blackbox fuzzers test by sending random input to the program and check the output. This approach tends to have a wide exploration of input values, thereby covering a significant portion of the program's code. However, a blackbox fuzzer might miss certain edge cases or input combinations that would be easily identifiable by a more targeted approach.\n\n(C) Whitebox: Whitebox fuzzers combine intelligence and knowledge of the program with blackbox fuzzing. They use knowledge of the program's internals to guide the random input generation, which often results in better coverage of the program's code. This style is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program.\n\n(D) Mutation-based: Mutation-based fuzzers focus on finding the boundaries or inputs that cause the most interesting or unexpected behavior in the program. These fuzzers can explore a wide range of inputs but are prone to missing certain types of errors since their focus is on obtaining specific behavior, not on comprehensively testing all possible code paths.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely fuzzer style to explore paths covering every line of code in the program is (C) Whitebox. This is because it uses knowledge of the program internals to guide random input generation, ensuring comprehensive coverage while also benefiting from the wide range of coverage attainable with blackbox fuzzing.\n\nAnswer: (C) Whitebox",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) True, True\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier - TLS protects against this attack by including sequence numbers in the packets and checking that the received sequence number is the next anticipated number in the sequence. If it's not, the packets are dropped, thus protecting against replay attacks.\n\n2. An attacker impersonating the server - TLS establishes a secure connection between the client and the server, authenticating the server by checking its certificate. This in itself prevents an attacker from impersonating the server without being able to correctly forge the identity of the server. Thus, TLS successfully protects against this type of attack.",

            "question": "MIT\u2019s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

The correct answer should involve the server checking the authentication status by interacting with the Kerberos server (KDC) and refusing to authenticate the user if the ticket is not valid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Kerberos server (KDC) is not refusing connections but ensuring that connections are established properly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the time for the client to stay connected is not tied to a ticket's expiration.\n\nOption C is incorrect because this logic would not guarantee that a user cannot connect with an expired ticket. The server would need other forms of authentication methods for users in case the ticket is expired.\n\nOption D is correct because it involves the server verifying the validity of the ticket with the Kerberos KDC server's (KDC) clock before authenticating the user and refusing authentication if the ticket is expired. This process ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket cannot be used to establish authenticated connections.",
