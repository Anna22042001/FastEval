            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen the left ventricle contracts, it pumps blood into the aorta and other major arteries. The blood then flows through these vessels to the rest of the body. However, the contractions of the left ventricle are not continuous. There are brief periods between contractions when the left ventricle relaxes.\n\nDuring these brief periods, the blood continues to flow through the vessels due to the elastic recoil of the arteries. Elastic recoil refers to the ability of the arteries to stretch and then return to their original shape, allowing the blood to continue flowing even when the heart is not contracting.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is true of Graves Disease of the thyroid, let's analyze each option step-by-step.\n\n(A) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. Ophthalmoplegia is a condition characterized by paralysis or weakness of the eye muscles. While Graves' disease can cause eye problems, such as bulging eyes (exophthalmos), it is not a direct cause of ophthalmoplegia.\n\n(B) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. A goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. A multi-nodular goitre is a type of goitre characterized by the presence of multiple nodules within the gland. Graves' disease can cause an enlarged thyroid gland, but it does not specifically cause a large multi-nodular goitre.\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is more common in females than males.\n\n(D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck': Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. Derbyshire Neck, also known as \"bull neck,\" is a condition characterized by a thickening of the neck muscles. Graves' disease can cause an enlarged thyroid gland, which may lead to a swollen neck, but it does not specifically cause Derbyshire Neck.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) It is commoner in males than females.",

These reactions can be divided into three main stages: glycolysis, the conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).\n\n(A) Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration, where glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. Oxygen is not directly involved in this process.\n\n(B) The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA is a part of the second stage of cellular respiration, called the citric acid cycle or Krebs' cycle. Oxygen is not directly involved in this process either.\n\n(C) The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is the third stage of cellular respiration. Oxygen is used in this process to oxidize the acetyl CoA molecules, which are produced in the previous stages, and convert them into carbon dioxide and water.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).",

            "model_answer": "To determine how long it may take for any pressure damage to be visible, we need to consider the time it takes for the pressure to cause damage and the time it takes for the damage to become visible.\n\n1. Time it takes for pressure to cause damage:\nPressure damage occurs when the pressure applied to the skin is greater than the skin's ability to withstand it. The time it takes for this damage to occur depends on the intensity of the pressure and the duration of the pressure. In general, the longer the pressure is applied, the more damage it can cause.\n\n2. Time it takes for damage to become visible:\nOnce the damage is caused, it may take some time for the visible signs of the damage to appear. This depends on factors such as the severity of the damage, the person's skin type, and the individual's healing process.\n\nConsidering these factors, we can estimate that it may take a few hours for the pressure damage to become visible. However, since we are given the time the patient has been on the operating table (4 hours), we cannot determine the exact time it may take for the damage to become visible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) 5 days.",

It can cause various symptoms, including spasticity, which is an increase in muscle tone and stiffness. However, spastic paraplegia is a specific condition characterized by spasticity in the legs, and MS is not the only cause of spastic paraplegia. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\n(B) Proprioceptive loss is a common feature:\nProprioception is the sense of the position and movement of the body in space. Proprioceptive loss refers to a decrease in the ability to sense the position and movement of the body. While proprioceptive loss can be a feature of some neurological conditions, it is not a common feature of spastic paraplegia. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected:\nSpastic paraplegia is a neurological condition characterized by spasticity in the legs, which affects the coordination and control of leg movements. This is because the spasticity causes increased muscle tone and stiffness, making it difficult to move the legs smoothly and efficiently. Therefore, this option is true.\n\n(D) The tone is normal or flaccid:\nSpastic paraplegia is characterized by increased muscle tone and stiffness in the legs, which is the opposite of normal or flaccid muscle tone. Therefore, this option is not true.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected",

It activates enzymes that help in the process of glycogen breakdown, allowing the body to access glucose for energy.\n\nInsulin (A) is involved in the regulation of blood sugar levels, but it does not directly activate glycogen breakdown in exercising muscles.\n\nIncreased pH (C) is not a factor that activates glycogen breakdown in exercising muscles.
