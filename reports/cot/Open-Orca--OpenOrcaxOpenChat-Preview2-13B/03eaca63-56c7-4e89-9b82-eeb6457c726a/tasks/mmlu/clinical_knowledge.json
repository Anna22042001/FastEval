            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate cannula size for a rapid blood transfusion, we need to take into account the patient's age and the blood flow that will be needed in the transfusion process. Cannula size dictates how easy it is to insert the IV catheter and to maintain the blood flow.\n\nGenerally, bigger gauges have larger diameter, which will allow for faster blood flow, but may also be more painful for the patient and potentially cause complications like phlebitis. Smaller gauge sizes are less painful but may not support fast blood flow.\n\nChildren, the elderly, and patients with fragile veins call for smaller size cannulas due to their minimal blood flow and the risk of more extensive tissue damage from a larger cannula.\n\nBased on this information, we would use:\n(A) 18 gauge for an adult patient who needs a rapid blood transfusion as of 2020 medical knowledge.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) Strength: Strength plays a role in marathon running, but it's not the key attribute. Runners need strength in their legs and core to reduce the risk of injury and maintain consistent speed, but other factors play a larger role in determining success.\n\n(B) Power: Power is a crucial aspect of marathon running, but it's not the key attribute. Power enables runners to generate fast speeds and overcome physical obstacles, but without stamina, power on its own can't sustain a high output for the long period required in a marathon.\n\n(C) Stride length: Stride length is a physical characteristic, which can affect a runner's speed. Although it's important, it's not the key attribute. Different runners have different stride lengths, and successful marathon runners typically consist of a wide range off stride lengths.\n\n(D) Stamina: Stamina directly relates to a runner's ability to maintain a fast pace throughout the time-consuming process of a marathon. Runner's stamina allows them to keep going through physical and mental challenges. In marathon running, stamina is crucial for consistent performance and victory.\n\nThus, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\n(D) Stamina.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis, we need to analyze each option separately.\n\n(A) Stridor is a symptom of anaphylaxis, as it is a high-pitched, whistling sound made while breathing, usually a sign of difficulty breathing.\n\n(B) Bradycardia is also a symptom of anaphylaxis, as it refers to a slow heart rate. A slowed heart rate can be a sign of a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze is another symptom of anaphylaxis, as it is a distinctive sound made during breathing, which usually indicates airway constriction or narrowing.\n\n(D) Rash is a symptom of anaphylaxis as well, as it typically appears with hives (urticaria) and sometimes blisters or bruises on the skin. This skin reaction is due to a release of chemicals in the body that affect blood flow and make skin red and bumpy.\n\nAfter evaluating all the options, we can conclude that (D) Rash is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis.

A colostomy bag wouldn't need a closed pouch.\n\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\nA closed pouch could be used in this time frame, but a low profile one would be more appropriate. This is not the only possible situation for closed pouches.\n\n(D) The patient has a urostomy.\nA urostomy is a surgical procedure where the surgeon creates an artificial connection between the urinarybladderandtheabdominalwallforurineoutput. This condition requires an attached bag with a drainage tube and doesn't always apply to closed pouches.\n\nOnly a few ostomy patients might need closed pouches. These are patients with acoleostomy (colostomy with only one stoma, perhaps because of a previous injury or surgery) or because they were emptied too often. This is not a common situation. Thus it could not be ranked higher than (D). \n\nHowever, it's important to note that closed pouches are not always necessary, depending on the patient's needs.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "First, let's examine each option:\n\nA) The anaerobic contribution refers to the work done by the anaerobic energy systems. In sprints, there is an increasing demand for energy, and the anaerobic systems have a shorter time to produce energy (about 10-12 seconds), than the aerobic system, which might take longer minutes minutes to produce substantial amounts of energy. Therefore, an increasing number of sprints would lead to a higher anaerobic contribution since the energy demands increase.\n\nB) The pH of the muscle falls below 6.0 refers to the acidity of the muscle, not the increasing number of sprints.\n\nC) Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L suggests that the body becomes depleted of fuel, but an increasing number of sprints itself wouldn't necessarily lead to this.\n\nD) The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases with an increase in the number of sprints doesn't seem to be true. The point is that the anaerobic system supplies the energy during the sprints. Even if sprints are performed in short intervals with less recovery period, the aerobic metabolism still provides most of the energy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n(A) anaerobic contribution progressively increases.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which of the following is true in diplopia, we should evaluate each statement one by one.\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered:\nFalse. Diplopia (double vision) occurs when both eyes cannot coordinate properly. If one eye is covered, diplopia that originates from that eye will be eliminated, but it does not mean the condition cannot happen at all.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image:\nFalse. The outer image is typically the more focused, accurate image, while the inner image is the blurry, false one. This is not always the case, as sometimes the inner image is more accurate depending on the cause of the diplopia.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards:\nFalse. Fourth nerve palsy generally affects the medial rectus muscle, causing an inward turning of the eye when one side is affected. However, the direction the patient looks does not determine if there's a fourth nerve palsy.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint:\nTrue. A sixth nerve palsy typically affects the lateral rectus muscle, which causes the eye to turn outward.

This can result in an increase in efficiency of muscle contractions, leading to improved running performance.\n\n(B) If Sodium Bicarbonate decreases the pH and reduces the buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, it will allow hydrogen ions to leave muscles at a faster rate. However, this is not consistent with an improved running performance, as a lower pH negatively affects muscle function.\n\n(C) If Sodium Bicarbonate elevates the pH and buffers the extracellular fluid, it will allow hydrogen ions to enter muscles at a faster rate. This would lead to a slower muscle contraction and would not be helpful in improving running performance.\n\n(D) If Sodium Bicarbonate elevates the pre-exercise muscle pH, it may have an effect on overall pH balance, but it does not address the key issue of accelerating the efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\n\nFrom the analysis, option (A) is the most consistent with improved middle distance running performance by elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscles.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

It is formed from fatty acids by the action of enzymes like fatty-acid synthetase and thiolase. Acetyl-CoA is ready to be utilized in the Krebs cycle for energy production.\n\n(D) Carnitine: Carnitine is an organic compound involved in the transport of fatty acids and other long-chain compounds across cellular membranes, not just into the mitochondria. It shuttles the fatty acids (in the form of acylcarnitine) from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix.\n\nSince CoA is the main molecule associated with the transport of fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria, and carnitine plays a role in transporting carboxylated forms of CoA, the answer is:\n\n(B) Coenzyme A (CoA).",
