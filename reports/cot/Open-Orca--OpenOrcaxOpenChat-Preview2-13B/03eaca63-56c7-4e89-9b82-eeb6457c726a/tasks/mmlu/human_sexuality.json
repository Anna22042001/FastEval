            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of these breast cancer detection methods involves exposure to radiation, we must first examine each method individually.\n\n(A) Needle aspiration: This is a method involving a fine needle inserted into the breast to extract a tissue sample, which is then examined microscopically. It does not involve any radiation.\n\n(B) Mammography: Mammography is a way of discovering breast cancer through a high-resolution X-ray image. It does involve radiation.\n\n(C) Mastectomy: Mastectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the breast(s) due to cancer. It does not involve any radiation in and of itself. However, it may sometimes be necessary after an image-guided biopsy, which uses X-ray imaging.\n\n(D) Lumpectomy: A lumpectomy is a procedure to remove the cancerous mass, or lumpectomy, from the breast. It is a surgical procedure and does not involve any radiation.\n\nThe method that involves exposure to radiation is:\n\n(B) Mammography",

Because it can be highly subjective, we cannot rule it out.\n\n(B) varies for women during the menstrual cycle: Some might think women have different sensitivities during their menstrual cycle, but it is also subjective to the individual's body and hormonal changes, making this statement possible but not universally true.\n\n(C) mainly on the lower portion of the body: This statement might be more common, as many people report their sensitive regions on the lower part of their body, but it is still not accurate for everyone.\n\nFinally, it would be wise to consider that sexual excitement can vary for each individual, based on their preferences and body structure.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n(D) all of the above",

            "model_answer": "First let's identify the answer step-by-step:\n\n(A) states that gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. True. Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection treatable with antibiotics.\n\n(B) states that gonorrhea has a high risk of infection with a single exposure. True. Direct contact with an infected person's body fluids is enough to transmit gonorrhea.\n\n(C) states that gonorrhea is asymptomatic, or without symptoms, in only a small percentage of those infected. True. Approximately 20-40% of males and up to 80% of females with gonorrhea are asymptomatic.\n\n(D) states that infections are limited to genital areas. False. While gonorrhea is often associated with the genital area, it can also infect other areas such as the rectum, throat, and eyes.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer that is true of gonorrhea is (A) can be treated with antibiotics, (B) has a high risk of infection with a single exposure, and (C) is asymptomatic (without symptoms) in only a small percentage of those infected.

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most dominant force in this situation, let's analyze the Freudian model of personality, particularly the id, ego, superego, and the Oedipus complex:\n\n1. The Id: It is the part of the personality that is unconscious and contains the instincts and drive-based behavior, such as aggression, sexual impulses, and the desire for pleasure. The id operates for immediate sexual and self-gratification with little to no consideration of social norms or external consequences.\n\n2. The Ego: It is the part of the personality that mediates between the id and the superego. It has two main functions:\n   a. Reality Testing Function: The ego examines reality by taking into account the external world and internally generated ideas, sensations, and feelings.\n   b. Adaptive Function: The ego decides which impulses from the id can be satisfied and to what extent, in order to find a balance between the demands of the id and the constraints and limits imposed by the superego.\n\n3. The Superego: It is the part of the personality that is concerned with societal values, moral standards, and internalized social rules. The superego informs us about right and wrong behavior, obligations and duties, and internalizes the standards from the parents and significant others in our environment.\n\n4. The Oedipus Complex: it is a phase in psychoanalytic theory postulated by Sigmund Freud. It is experienced by young boys when they develop a sexual and emotional attachment to the same-sex parent, and a rivalry toward the opposite-sex parent, in an effort to replace the same-sex parent and gain control over them. The Oedipus Complex can later develop into the Electra Complex in girls.\n\nConsidering your situation: you were led by your lusty urges and the allure of instant gratification (the id), and overcame the slight hesitation of studying for a test (the ego). You ultimately gave in to the temptation of spending time with your friend Jacques (the id), even if it meant defying your conscience or your internalized moral standards (the superego). \n\nThus, the id was the most dominant force in your decision-making process.\n\nAnswer: (A) the id",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Answer:\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli\n\nExplanation:\n\nStep 1: Understand the issue\nSociobiologists want to explain the imbalance in male and female occurrence of paraphilias, which are \"abnormal or extreme sexual desires.\"\n\nStep 2: Eliminate unrelated answers\n(A) paraphilias guarantee survival of the species - The question is about gender differences, not survival.\n(C) of left brain/right brain differences between the genders - The question is about sociobiological reasons, not the brain development's contributing factors.\n(D) male brains are better developed than are female brains -This answer is mere speculation, and it doesn't address the sociobiological viewpoint.\n\nStep 3: Consider the remaining answer\n(B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli - This answer takes into account sociobiology's focus on evolutionary selection and how it favors behaviors that may aid a species' survival. The development of novel sexual responses in males may enhance the likelihood of mating with novel individuals, which in turn favors genetic diversity and the survival of the species. This explanation connects the evolutionary process to the statistics observed in paraphiliacs.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, the correct answer is B.",

Helen appears to be put off by Joe's desperate advances.\n3. This is typical of Joe's relationships with women.\n\nNow let's analyze each option and its relevance according to attachment theory:\n\n(A) a secure lover\n- A secure lover is someone who can comfortably maintain closeness in relationships without fear of being rejected or needing constant reassurance.\n- Since Joe's desperate advances and being put off by women don't fit the secure lover criteria, this option is not suitable.\n\n(B) an avoidant lover\n- An avoidant lover maintains a sense of emotional separation even in close relationships and may have difficulties with intimacy. This could describe Joe as he appears to be trying to avoid getting emotionally close to Helen.\n- This option aligns with Joe's behavior and relationships. It's a probable answer.\n\n(C) an anxious-ambivalent lover\n- An anxious-ambivalent lover tends to crave closeness and affection but also fears intimacy and rejection, leading to mixed feelings and mixed signals. This option doesn't clearly describe Joe's behavior as he seems to want a close relationship with Helen but his advances are desperate.\n- This option isn't applicable due to unclear description and mixed feelings.\n\n(D) a passionate lover\n- A passionate lover is someone who has a high level of intensity in their relationships and emotions. This option doesn't align with Joe's behavior since his desperate advances don't point to passionate love.\n- This option is not suitable as it doesn't directly connect to Joe's attachment style.\n\nBased on the analysis, Joe would best be described as:\n\n(B) an avoidant lover",

            "model_answer": "Before answering, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) This option suggests that Bruce might have participated in more female-typical play as a child, and this is often true for homosexual children because they might explore and embrace their homosexual identity at an early stage. However, this does not apply to Bruce if we were to observe them as children prior to Bruce identifying as homosexual.\n\n(B) This is likely the correct option because it states that Bruce might have participated in more male-typical play than Chuck as a child, due to Bruce's homosexual orientation. This suggests that Bruce's play or interests might be more influenced by or related to characteristics of males compared to Chuck's.\n\n(C) This option states that both Bruce and Chuck likely participated in more male-typical play than female-typical play, though it doesn't specify which option this would be compared to. Since Bruce is homosexual and Chuck is heterosexual, this is not an accurate statement.\n\n(D) It is not possible to determine someone's sexual orientation solely by observing their father's tendencies or behavior.
