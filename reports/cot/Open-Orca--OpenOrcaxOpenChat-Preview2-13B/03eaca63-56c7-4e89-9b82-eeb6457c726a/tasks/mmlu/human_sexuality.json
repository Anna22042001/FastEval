            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Hormones secreted by the Mother's ovaries: Ovaries are responsible for producing eggs and hormones related to the menstrual cycle, but not directly related to the onset of labor.\n\n(B) Hormones secreted by the Mother's hypothalamus: The hypothalamus is a part of the brain that regulates various bodily functions, including the release of hormones. However, it is not the primary trigger for the onset of labor.\n\n(C) Hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland: The adrenal gland is responsible for producing hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which help the body respond to stress. However, it is not directly involved in the onset of labor.\n\n(D) The placenta and uterus secretion of prostaglandins: Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that help to soften and dilate the cervix, which is a crucial step in the onset of labor.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) the placenta and uterus secretion of prostaglandins",

            "model_answer": "To determine which theory uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior, we need to analyze each option:\n\n(A) Sociobiology: Sociobiology is a branch of biology that studies the social behavior of animals, including humans. It does not focus on the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(B) Psychoanalytic theory: Psychoanalytic theory, developed by Sigmund Freud, focuses on the unconscious mind and the influence of childhood experiences on adult behavior. It does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(C) Script theory: Script theory is a communication theory that focuses on the role of scripts in shaping human behavior. It does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(D) Social learning theory: Social learning theory, developed by Albert Bandura, focuses on the learning of new behaviors through observation, imitation, and modeling. It explains how individuals learn new behaviors, including those related to sexual behavior, by observing and imitating others.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n(D) Social learning theory",

            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the terms mentioned in the question.\n\n(A) Menstruation: This is the monthly discharge of blood and tissue from the lining of the uterus, which occurs when an egg is not fertilized.\n\n(B) Ovulation: This is the release of an egg from the ovary, which occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle.\n\n(C) The luteal phase: This is the phase of the menstrual cycle that occurs after ovulation and before menstruation. During this phase, the body prepares for a possible pregnancy.\n\n(D) The follicular phase: This is the phase of the menstrual cycle that occurs before ovulation. During this phase, the body prepares for ovulation by producing hormones and growing follicles.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question: \"__________ is a shedding of the inner lining of the uterus.\"\n\nSince the question is asking about a shedding of the inner lining of the uterus, we can eliminate options (B) Ovulation and (D) The follicular phase, as these are not related to the shedding of the uterine lining.\n\nBetween options (A) Menstruation and (C) The luteal phase, menstruation is the correct answer.

Proliferation: This is the phase of the menstrual cycle when the uterine lining is building up, and sperm survival and movement are not a primary concern.\n\n3. Ovulation: This is the phase when the egg is released from the follicle and sperm are most likely to encounter the egg. The environment is more hospitable for sperm passage during this phase.\n\n4.
