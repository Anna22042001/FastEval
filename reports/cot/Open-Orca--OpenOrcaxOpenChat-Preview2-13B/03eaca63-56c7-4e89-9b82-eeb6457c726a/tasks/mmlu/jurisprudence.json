This implies that there should be a clear and definitive answer to each legal question.\n\n(A) and (B) both involve the consideration of rights in legal decisions, which is consistent with Dworkin's claim.\n\n(C) Inconsistent with Dworkin's claim, as strong discretion implies that judges have the freedom to make decisions based on their personal beliefs and interpretations, rather than a single right answer.\n\n(D) This option is also consistent with Dworkin's claim, as seeking the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history implies that there is a clear and definitive answer to be found within the legal framework.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Greek Thinking\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe idea of 'natural law' first appeared in Greek Thinking. This concept was developed by philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, who believed in the existence of universal principles that governed the natural world. These principles were considered to be objective and unchanging, and they provided a basis for understanding the nature of justice and morality.\n\nWhile the concept of natural law was later adopted and expanded upon by other philosophers and legal systems, its origins can be traced back to Greek Thinking. The other options, such as the French Revolution, American War of Independence, and Roman Law, are not directly related to the development of the concept of natural law.",

This standard is used to determine whether a defendant's actions were negligent or not.\n\n(A) is incorrect because the reasonable person standard is a universal standard, not varying from person to person.\n(B) is incorrect because the reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's behavior, not their subjective mental state.\n(D) is incorrect because the reasonable person standard is not based on the defendant's mental disability, but rather on the behavior expected of a reasonable person in the same situation.\n\nAnswer: (C) A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.",

However, the formula only includes responsibility and harm.\n\n(B) Extent of responsibility multiplied by actual harm done: This option combines the extent of responsibility (which is already included in the formula) with the actual harm done. This option aligns with the formula r x H.\n\n(C) Risk of violence multiplied by degree of humility of offender: This option introduces new concepts (risk of violence and degree of humility) that are not mentioned in the formula.\n\n(D) Recidivism multiplied by defendant's history: This option introduces the concept of recidivism (which is not mentioned in the formula) and the defendant's history.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Extent of responsibility multiplied by actual harm done.",
