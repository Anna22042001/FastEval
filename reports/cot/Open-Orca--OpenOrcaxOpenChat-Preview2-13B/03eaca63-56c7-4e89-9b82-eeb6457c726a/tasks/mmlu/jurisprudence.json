            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) It demonstrates the difference between the internal and the external aspect of a rule.\n\nHart's distinction between 'being obliged' and 'having an obligation' is primarily focused on explaining the inner workings of a rule, which can be understood at the level of actions and practices. When someone is obliged by a rule, they have a direct compulsion to abide by the rule. Rules with obligations involve a moral or legal mandate that carries a sense of responsibility, even if the consequences of following or not following the rules aren't immediate. \n\nTherefore, the aim of this distinction is to show the difference between the internal aspect of a rule that matters to the individuals who are 'being obliged', and the external aspect of a rule that mandates people to act in a certain way, irrespective of the consciousness and will involved in acting upon it.",

In what way?\n\n(B) His concept of status is misrepresented.\n\nThis phrase is about the changing nature of societal relationships and organizational structures, shifting from a more in-person, obligation-based system (status) to a contract-based system where agreements are formalized and often more legally-oriented. However, Maine's idea of status being an idea rooted in in-person relationships and obligations is often misrepresented or misunderstood, with some people thinking that status only includes hierarchical or legal systems. As a result, it obscures the full meaning and concept behind Maine's aphorism.",

            "question": "Which of the following factors contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century?\n\n(A) Depression of the 1930\n(B) The rise of Fascism\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution",

            "model_answer": "To determine which factor contributed significantly to the revival of natural law in the 20th century, let us examine each option:\n\n(A) Depression of the 1930s: While the Great Depression had a significant impact on the economy and politics of the time, it is unlikely to have directly contributed to the revival of natural law.\n\n(B) The rise of Fascism: The rise of Fascism actually undermined human rights and natural law, implemented by regimes like Nazi Germany, which did not uphold natural rights.\n\n(C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II: This option is the most plausible one. The United Nations was founded as a result of World War II and promotes human rights globally. This shift in focus likely inspired renewed interest in natural law as a philosophical foundation for human rights.\n\n(D) The Bolshevik Revolution: The Bolshevik Revolution, led by the Communist Party, was not a direct factor in the revival of natural law, as it did not promote natural rights or natural law principles. Instead, it led to the rise of communist regimes that sought to replace natural law with Marxist principles.\n\nFinal answer: (C) The international recognition of human rights after World War II",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Let's analyze each criticism step-by-step:\n\n(A) This statement says there is no distinction between the two forms of legal reasoning. Llewellyn himself creates this distinction, so it is clear that there is a distinction for him. This option is, therefore, not compelling to support a criticism on his distinction.\n\n(B) Although this point is true in the sense that judges interpret the law, it does not criticize Llewellyn's distinction. It merely reiterates the role of judges.\n\n(C) This criticism highlights the restrictive nature of pigeonholing judges. Judges apply different styles of legal reasoning based on different circumstances. It is not a constant practice that they stick to one style irrespective of the situation. It could be that assigning judges particular styles is unhelpful and might affect their ability to handle complex and subtle cases in different situations. This criticism is a bit closer to being compelling compared to the others.\n\n(D) This option claims that judicial reasoning has a constant form - the formal one. While some argue that judicial reasoning is, they also claim that reasoning changes based on the context in each case.\n\nFrom these analyses, the most compelling criticism of Llewellyn's distinction between the grand and formal styles of legal reasoning is:\n\n(C) It is misleading to pigeon-hole judges in this way.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) The POP will choose equality over power.\n\nThis option is the most consistent with Rawls's claims about the POP primarily because the POP is basically an imaginary person representing the least advantaged members of society. The primary focus of the social primary goods, in his claim, is the well-being and fair distribution of goods, which can ultimately lead to a society that protects ordinary citizens from the harsh effects of despotic power.\n\nThus, to ensure social justice and a fair distribution of social primary goods, the made-up person (POP) would choose equality over power. This could also be seen as a slight generalization, but in Rawls' conception, the POP is generally defined as someone who would prioritize social justice over selfish individual interests. By prioritizing a more equal society, they are protecting those who are less advantaged or are unable to claim or protect their interests.\n\nThe other options (A, C, and D) do not align as accurately with Rawls' claim about the POP's social primary goods preferences. While option (C) - being unselfish - might be associated with the POP's general moral character, it doesn't directly connect to their preference for specific social goods. Option (A) contradicts the POP's focus on social justice by claiming they would choose wealth over a compassionate society. Option (D) seems to focus on the POP's consideration of specific vulnerable groups, but it's not primarily about the broader social distribution of primary goods.",

A command can include a sanction, and if we follow Austin's argument, the sanction should be the smallest chance of incurring the smallest evil.\n\n(B) This statement also follows logically from Austin's argument. It explains that since a sanction generally follows disobedience to a command, it's expected that the concept of a command contains a probability of encountering a sanction.\n\n(C) This statement doesn't seem to directly follow Austin's argument. It mentions the relationship between a command and a sanction, but the presence of a sanction is not directly related to whether the command contains the power to change one's legal status. This statement does not address the sanction's size.\n\n(D) This statement is the least likely to follow logically from Austin's argument. It doesn't directly address the relationship between a command and a sanction, focusing instead on the legal consequences of a command.\n\nAnswer: (D) A command confers power to change one's legal status.",
