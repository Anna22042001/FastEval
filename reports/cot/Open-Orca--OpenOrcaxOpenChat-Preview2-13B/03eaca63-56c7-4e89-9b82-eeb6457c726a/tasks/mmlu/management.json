            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Examine each option and its meaning.\n\nA) Bargaining - The process of discussing and making deals to reach an agreement. It refers to a situation specifically focused on getting the best possible outcome for a single party.\n\nB) Satisficing - A concept in decision-making in which an individual won't settle for the best possible outcome, but rather decides to accept an outcome that is considered satisfactory or just acceptable.\n\nC) Accepting - The act of believing or affirming a proposed idea or aim. It doesn't necessarily imply reaching a sub-optimal or compromise.\n\nD) Compromising - A negotiation approach where two parties agree to a solution that partially resolves their differences. It means neither party gets exactly what they want.\n\nStep 2: Compare the meanings with the given context about the term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome.\n\nOption (B) matches the context of a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome. It doesn't describe the negotiation process itself but focuses on the acceptance of an outcome deemed acceptable.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question.\n\n(B) Satisficing",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Heuristics\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making refers to a mental shortcut or a simplified method of making a decision, which can lead to biases in the decision-making process. Among the given options, (A) Framing bias, (B) Hindsight bias, and (C) Over-confidence bias are all specific types of biases.\n\n(A) Framing bias refers to the situation where people make decisions based on the way information is presented to them, rather than on the substance of the information itself.\n\n(B) Hindsight bias is a cognitive bias that causes people to mistakenly believe that they could have predicted an event after it has already occurred, just because they now have more information about the event.\n\n(C) Over-confidence bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when people have unjustifiably high or excessive confidence in their judgment, resulting in potentially biased decisions.\n\n(D) Heuristics is a broader term that refers to making decisions using mental shortcuts or simplified methods, and hence it is the best option that defines the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which one of the following political leaders could not be termed a 'transformational' leader, we will examine each leader's impact on their nations during their tenure as political leaders.\n\n(A) Margaret Thatcher was a British stateswoman, serving as the Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990. She implemented significant economic policies, like privatization and deregulation, which transformed Britain's economy, often referred to as 'Thatcherism.' Given the substantial impact of these policies, she could be considered a transformational leader.\n\n(B) Mikhail Gorbachev was the final leader of the Soviet Union. One of his signature policies was 'Glasnost' (openness) and 'Perestroika' (restructuring), which aimed to reform and modernize the Soviet Union. Although these reforms did not fully lead to the desired outcome, Gorbachev pursued transformational change.\n\n(C) Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. His mandate led to democratic reforms, racial reconciliation, and the end of the apartheid system. Given these significant changes, Nelson Mandela is considered a transformational leader.\n\n(D) Bill Clinton served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Clinton implemented economic reforms, including budget deficit reduction and welfare reform, and also addressed social issues like LGBTQ+ rights and racial equality. Given these transformative actions, he could also be seen as a transformational leader.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the provided options entirely cannot be considered a 'transformational' leader. All three leaders, Thatcher, Gorbachev, and Mandela, pursued transformational policies in their countries. Clinton, although not fully achieving transformative objectives, still implemented multiple significant changes. However, to answer in a singular letter without context of the political landscape or impacts of each leader, we can choose:\n\n(C) Nelson Mandela",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A Gantt chart is a type of Work schedule design.\n\nThe reason for this is that a Gantt chart is a project management tool, typically used to illustrate the tasks and milestones, which are part of a project schedule. It provides a visual representation of the planned work, generally showing the start and end dates of tasks, as well as their duration, and it allows for easy tracking of progress and foresight into potential delays. This directly relates to the creation of schedules for managing and organizing work, hence the answer is (B) Work schedule design.",

It does not necessarily convey power derived from status or position.\n\n(C) Reward - Although this term can be related to power in the sense that a person may seek power or status to achieve rewards, it is usually associated much more closely with gains and incentives. \n\n(D) Legitimate - This term refers to something that is recognized as being true, appropriate or well-founded. While it can signify a sense of order in an organization, it does not specifically point to power derived from status or position.\n\nAfter evaluating these options, it is clear that the term for power derived from status or position in an organization is:\n\n(D) Legitimate",

He is a German sociologist, economist, and political philosopher who is famous for his works on bureaucratic structures and the relationship between certain aspects of life, such as politics, economy, and society. He is particularly known for his concept of \"bureaucratic polity\" and the development of the bureaucratic model in his iron cage theory. This concept is considered the corner stone of classical and modern public administration and management theories.\n\nAlthough Henry Fayol, Adam Smith, and Mary Parker Follett are also associated with important management concepts and theories, their work does not serve as the foundation for study of bureaucratic structures.\n\nThus, the most appropriate answer is:\n(B) Max Weber",
