            "question": "A 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination. The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1\n\nReasoning:\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and the sacroiliac joints. The most common treatment for this condition is with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\n\nIn this case, the patient has already tried conventional NSAIDs and sulfasalazine, which is another DMARD, but with no improvement. Therefore, the next step in treatment should be a drug that targets a different aspect of the inflammatory process.\n\nTumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis. Inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 can help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms in patients with this condition.\n\nThus, the most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient would be to administer a drug that inhibits TNF-\u03b1.",

            "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) res ipsa loquitur\n\nThe legal concept invoked by the patient is res ipsa loquitur, which means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" In this case, the presence of a surgical sponge in the patient's pelvis after a hysterectomy is evidence of negligence on the part of the medical professionals involved in the surgery. The sponge could not have been left in the patient's body without negligence, and the fact that it was found after a CT scan supports the idea that the injury was not a result of the patient's own actions or pre-existing conditions.",

The patient's symptoms include confusion, lethargy, and muscle rigidity, which are not consistent with amphetamine intoxication.\n\n(B) Bacterial meningitis: Bacterial meningitis is characterized by fever, headache, and neck stiffness. The patient's symptoms do not include fever or neck stiffness, and the fever he has is not high enough to be consistent with bacterial meningitis.\n\n(C) Delirium tremens: Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that presents with symptoms such as confusion, hallucinations, and seizures. The patient's history of excessive drinking and recent psychiatric treatment for hearing voices suggest a possible alcohol withdrawal. The patient's symptoms, including confusion, lethargy, and muscle rigidity, are consistent with delirium tremens.\n\n(D) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but life-threatening complication of antipsychotic medication use, characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status.

            "model_answer": "(C) Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive\n\nReasoning:\nThe patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which was treated with diazepam. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can cause respiratory depression, which is a decrease in the rate or depth of breathing. In this case, the patient's respiratory rate was 10/min and shallow, which indicates that her respiratory drive was suppressed. This suppression of the central respiratory drive is most likely due to the medication (diazepam) rather than other causes like airway occlusion, encephalitis, or meningitis.",
