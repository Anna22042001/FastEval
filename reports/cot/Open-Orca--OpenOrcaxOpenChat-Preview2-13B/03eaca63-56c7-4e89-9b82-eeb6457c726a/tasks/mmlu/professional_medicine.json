            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

The other answer choices do not provide a direct or reasonable connection to this sensation problem the patient had.",

The patient and his family immigrated to the United States 2 months ago and he has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years. He has been generally healthy. Medical history is significant for pneumonia at age 3 years. He takes no medications. He is at the 25th percentile for height, weight, and BMI. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 82/min, respirations 20/min, and blood pressure 112/74 mm Hg. Cardiac examination discloses a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. Femoral pulses are weak and brachial pulses are strong; there is a radiofemoral delay. Chest xray discloses mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy.

The patient has a history of pneumonia at age 3 years and a significant heart murmur at age 9. This suggests a possible congenital heart disease.\n2. Cardiac examination reveals mild cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence.\n3. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. This suggests an overworked heart, likely due to a heart condition or increased blood pressure.\n\nTaking these points into account, we can now determine which complication the patient is at greatest risk for.\n\n(A) Atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm and is not necessarily related to cardiomegaly or left ventricular hypertrophy.\n(B) Cor pulmonale is a condition where the right side of the heart enlarges due to chronic pulmonary hypertension, which is not directly related to the information provided in the case.\n(C) Systemic hypertension is not the main concern in this patient's case, as the ECG reveals left ventricular hypertrophy, indicating that the overworked heart is due to other factors than increased blood pressure.\n(D) Tricuspid valve regurgitation is a condition that can accompany left ventricular hypertrophy but is not the main complication the patient is at greatest risk for based on the given information.\n\nThe excessive workload on the left ventricle, which causes left ventricular hypertrophy, puts the patient at greatest risk for (B) Cor pulmonale. If the condition is allowed to progress, this can lead to right-sided heart failure.",

It is not directly associated with the ring and small fingers.\n- Musculocutaneous nerve: This nerve mainly innervates the arm and shoulder muscles, and it is unlikely to cause numbness in the hand's fingers.\n- Radial nerve: This nerve supplies the arm, parts of the forearm, and most of the fingers, except the index and small fingers, which are not impacted.\n- Ulnar nerve: This nerve extends from the medial side of the upper and lower arm and innervates the fingers at the buttocks motor and radicular areas associated with the ring and little fingers.\n\nGiven the location of the numbness and the severity of the pain upon palpation of the right elbow, the most likely cause is the entrapment of the Ulnar nerve at the elbow.\n\nAnswer: (D) Ulnar nerve at the elbow",

Malonyl-CoA is an important molecule involved in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis and inhibition of carboxylation reactions. \n\nWhen there is an increased concentration of malonyl-CoA, it binds to carboxylase enzymes which are required for the conversion of certain molecules into their &#945;-keto forms. This inhibits the carboxylation reactions and thus affects the process of fatty acid oxidation, energy production from fatty acids, and synthesis of some amino acids.\n\nConsidering the provided information and the role of malonyl-CoA, the process that is most likely directly inhibited by the increased concentration of malonyl-CoA is:\n\n(A) Fatty acid oxidation",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most appropriate lymph node to evaluate first for evidence of metastasis in a patient with a tongue mass, it is crucial to consider the location and characteristics of the primary site and lymphatic drainage pattern.\n\nIn this case, the patient has a 1.5-cm mass at the apex of the tongue, which is squamous cell carcinoma. Pathologically, squamous cell carcinoma typically originates from the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx.\n\nThe oral cavity includes several regions, such as the lips, oral floor, buccal mucosa, palate, and alveolar process. Furthermore, the tongue is divided into two primary regions, the anterior and posterior parts. The larynx, hypopharynx, and oropharynx follow the pharyngeal walls.\n\nOral squamous cell carcinomas usually spread to lymph nodes via several pathways: through cervical lymph nodes of the tonsil and tongue, via lingual and hypopharyngeal nodes, and through the pharyngeal nodes. In particular, the superior deep neck nodes (located along the internal jugular veins) and prelaryngeal nodes (located above the larynx) are mostly involved as these nodes abut the oropharynx and hypopharynx regions.\n\nConsidering this information, I will now analyze each of the given options:\n\n(A) Inferior deep cervical nodes: These nodes are part of the lymphatic drainage system of the superior cervical and pharyngeal lymph nodes. In our case, the primary tumor is in the posterior tongue and not in the oropharynx. Therefore, these nodes do not seem to be the most appropriate to evaluate first.\n\n(B) Parotid nodes: These nodes are located within the parotid gland, which is the major salivary gland for the oral and facial region. The parotid regions mainly drain into the upper deep cervical lymph nodes and do not directly drain the tongue. Thus, these nodes are not the most appropriate ones to evaluate first.\n\n(C) Retropharyngeal nodes: These nodes are located in the back of the neck and are associated with the retropharyngeal spaces. They can also receive drainage from the oral cavity, including the tongue area. Although they might contain some relationship with tongue cancers, these nodes are not the most proximal anatomically related to the primary tongue mass.\n\n(D) Submental nodes: These nodes are part of the submandibular group and contain lymphatic drainage for the mandible, face and mouth region. They are mostly related to the anterior part of the tongue and can play a role in the lymphatic drainage of tongue cancers.\n\nConsidering the patient's history, the tumor's location and characteristics, and the lymphatic drainage pattern, the most appropriate lymph node to evaluate first for evidence of metastasis in this patient is the submental nodes (D).",
