            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the context of the question. The question is about which State exercises jurisdiction in crimes committed on board vessels.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options.\nA. The coastal State: This implies the state bordering the sea or ocean where the crimes are committed.\nB. The flag State: This is the state whose nationality is flown or exhibited on the vessel.\nC. All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This means multiple states can exercise jurisdiction in such cases.\nD. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: This is a tribunal set up to resolve disputes related to the maritime law, not a state.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options based on the context of the question.\nThe coastal state, flag state, and the international tribunal don't meet the criteria as those entities are not states. The question is asking for the state that has jurisdiction, so any states can't be the answer.\n\nStep 4: Conclude based on the analysis and provide the answer.\nBased on the analysis, the answer is (B) The flag State.\n\nAnswer: B",

            "model_answer": "(A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders\n\nJusticiability is a concept that deals with the legal ability of a dispute to be resolved by a court. In this context, it focuses on whether a particular right or claim can be enforced by the relevant rights holders. The term itself does not encompass the just nature or cause of a right (option B), nor does it refer to the courts' assessment of non-enforcement (option C), or the obligation of a state to enforce a particular right (option D). Instead, justiciability aims to determine whether a legal dispute is amenable to a legal solution through a court, considering both procedural and substantive aspects.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "R2P is different from humanitarian intervention in the following way.\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn this context, R2P (Responsibility to Protect) is a principle that emphasizes the international community's responsibility to prevent and halt genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It is built on the idea that sovereign states have a responsibility to protect their populations from these abuses. In contrast, humanitarian intervention refers to direct involvement in another state's internal affairs for the purpose of alleviating human suffering caused by conflicts, natural disasters, or other events, without necessarily focusing on preventing larger human rights abuses.\n\nThe key difference between R2P and humanitarian intervention is that R2P is more focused on preventing and stopping the large-scale abuses mentioned above, while humanitarian intervention is broader in its scope and more generally aims to reduce human suffering. Additionally, R2P often requires the involvement of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) before taking action, whereas humanitarian intervention can be carried out without the approval of the UNSC. This adds an additional layer of accountability and legitimacy to R2P, which is important for its successful implementation.",

Instead, it is comprised of various sources such as Acts of Parliament, previous legal rulings, conventions, and some guidance from the British Monarchy. Therefore, statement (C) best describes the UK Constitution as an uncodified constitution with multiple sources.",

The Committee of Ministers is responsible for hearing \"admissibility\" cases, and they are not changed from a three-judge to a one-judge formation under Protocol 14.\n\n(B) Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility: This statement is false. While Protocol 14 introduced some changes and streamlined the admissibility mechanism, it did not add a completely new criterion.\n\n(C) Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights: This statement is false. The abolishment of the Commission of Human Rights occurred much earlier, in 2007, with the establishment of the European Union Human Rights Office under Protocol 12.\n\n(D) Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights: This statement is false. The term of office for judges at the European Court of Human Rights was not extended with the introduction of Protocol 14.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",
