            "model_answer": "To find the answer, we need to consider the number of households in the United States and the average number of movies watched per household per year.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 126.2 million households in the United States in 2020.\n\nThe average number of movies watched per household per year is difficult to determine, as it can vary greatly depending on factors such as income, age, and location. However, we can use a conservative estimate to get a rough idea.\n\nLet's assume that the average household watches 10 movies per year.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year:\n\n126.2 million households * 10 movies per household per year = 1,262,000,000 movies\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(B) 2,000,000,000",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the energy content of ice and the amount of ice that is wasted each year.\n\nStep 1: Determine the energy content of ice\nThe energy content of ice is equal to the energy required to melt it. The specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.09 J/g. The density of ice is approximately 0.917 g/cm\u00b3. Therefore, the energy content of ice can be calculated as:\n\nEnergy content of ice = specific heat capacity * density * mass\nEnergy content of ice = 2.09 J/g * 0.917 g/cm\u00b3 * (1 cm\u00b3/1000 cm\u00b3)\nEnergy content of ice \u2248 1.88 J/cm\u00b3\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of ice wasted each year\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, Americans throw away approximately 25,000,000,000 pounds (11,339,819,032 kg) of ice each year.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the energy wasted\nNow that we have the energy content of ice and the amount of ice wasted each year, we can calculate the total energy wasted:\n\nEnergy wasted = energy content of ice * amount of ice wasted\nEnergy wasted \u2248 1.88 J/cm\u00b3 * 11,339,819,032 kg\nEnergy wasted \u2248 21,333,333,333,333 J\n\nStep 4: Convert the energy to the appropriate unit\nTo convert the energy to the unit given in the question, we need to convert Joules to Joules per second (J/s).\n\n1 Joule = 1 J/s\n\nStep 5: Calculate the energy wasted in the given unit\nEnergy wasted = 21,333,333,333,333 J * (1 J/s) / (1 J/s)\nEnergy wasted \u2248 21,333,333,333,333 J/s\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nThe answer is (A) 6*10^8 J.",
