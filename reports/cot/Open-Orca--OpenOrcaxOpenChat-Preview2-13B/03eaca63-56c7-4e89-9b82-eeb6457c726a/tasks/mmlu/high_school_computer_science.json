            "model_answer": "To find the value of x << 3 in Python 3, we will first convert the \"<<\" to its numeric value and then perform the operation on x once it's converted to integer type.\n\nStep 1: Convert \"<<\" to its numeric value.\nIn Python 3, the left shift operator (<<) means moving all the bits to the left. Since the left shift operator counts from the most significant bit side, it will count the number of zero pad bits. We know x = 1, so the left shift operator will count 0 zeros, making \"right shift by 3\".\n\nStep 2: Convert x to an integer type.\nSince x is a integer, no further conversion is needed.\n\nStep 3: Perform the operation.\n1 >> 3 is equivalent to 1 / 2 because when we move all the bits to the right three places, we would get 0.\n\n(1 >> 3) will produce a 0 as a result since 1 divided by 2 equals 0. 0 is essentially the same outcome as 1 right shifted by 3.\n\nOutput: (A) 0",
