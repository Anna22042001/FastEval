It is not an \"ad populum\" fallacy.\n\n(B) suppressed evidence: This fallacy involves withholding or distorting evidence to support one's argument. It is not an \"ad populum\" fallacy.\n\n(C) appeal to pride: This fallacy involves appealing to a person's sense of pride or self-importance to persuade them. It is not an \"ad populum\" fallacy.\n\n(D) appeal to the people: This option is the correct answer. \"Ad populum\" refers to an argument that appeals to the emotions or desires of the people, rather than using logical reasoning or evidence.\n\nAnswer: (D) appeal to the people",

A syllogism is formally invalid if the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) cannot be materially true: This statement is incorrect because a formally invalid syllogism can still be materially true.
