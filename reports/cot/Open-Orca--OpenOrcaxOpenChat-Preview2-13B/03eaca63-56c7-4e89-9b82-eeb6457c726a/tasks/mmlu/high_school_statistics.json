            "model_answer": "To determine the most appropriate statement, we need to understand the information given and how to interpret it.\n\n1. The average donation is $155 with a standard deviation of $32.\n2. The standard deviation is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of values.\n3. The 95% confidence interval is a range of values that contains the true average value of a population with 95% certainty.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n(A) This November, the average donation is $155.\nThis statement is true, as the average donation is given as $155.\n\n(B) 50% of all donations this November are more than $155.\nTo determine if this statement is true, we need to find the value at which 50% of the donations fall. Since the average donation is $155, we can say that 50% of the donations are less than $155.\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval, we need to use the formula:\nLower limit = average - (standard deviation * z-score)\nUpper limit = average + (standard deviation * z-score)\n\nwhere z-score = 1.96 (for 95% confidence)\n\nUsing the given information, we can calculate the 95% confidence interval:\n\nLower limit = $155 - (32 * 1.96) = $155 - $64.88 = $90.12\nUpper limit = $155 + (32 * 1.96) = $155 + $64.88 = $219.88\n\nThe 95% confidence interval is between about $90.12 and $219.88.\n\n(D) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $149 and $161.\nThis statement is incorrect, as the calculated 95% confidence interval is between $90.12 and $219.88, not between $149 and $161.\n\nSo, the most appropriate statement is:\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.",

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible.

            "model_answer": "The teachers' union would most likely quote (D) The median of all the salaries during negotiations.\n\nReasoning:\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries: The mean is the average of all the salaries, which may not be the most relevant information for the teachers' union, as it could be skewed by the high salaries of a few administrators.\n\n(B) The mode of all the salaries: The mode is the most common value in a data set, which may not be helpful in negotiations, as it does not provide information about the average salary of the teachers.\n\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries: The standard deviation measures the spread of the data, but it does not provide information about the average salary of the teachers.\n\n(D) The median of all the salaries: The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in ascending order. It is a more appropriate statistic for the teachers' union to quote during negotiations, as it provides a better representation of the average salary of the teachers, without being influenced by the high salaries of a few administrators.",
