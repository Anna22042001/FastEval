The military was formed as a result of social complexity and the need for defense and expansion.\n\n(B) the state: The state is a broader concept that encompasses various institutions, including the military, economy, and religion. The state itself did not exist before the advent of social complexity, as it is a product of social organization and governance.\n\n(C) the temple: Temples were important religious and cultural centers in Mesopotamia. They were places where people gathered to worship, perform rituals, and seek guidance from the gods. Temples were often associated with the ruling elite and played a significant role in the political and social life of the community. However, temples were not set apart and had powers before the advent of social complexity.\n\n(D) the hunting association: Hunting associations were groups of people who came together to hunt and provide food for their communities.

This is a plausible idea, as tool making and language both require complex cognitive processes and may have evolved together.\n\n(B) The hypothesis states that tool making requires cooperation that can only exist with language. While cooperation is essential for tool making, it is not exclusive to language. Cooperation can also be achieved through non-verbal communication and other forms of social interaction.\n\n(C) The hypothesis claims that tool making originated millions of years after language evolved. This is a widely accepted theory, as the archaeological record shows that stone tools appeared much later than the earliest evidence of language.\n\n(D) The hypothesis suggests that connections made between the brain and bipedal locomotion prepared the hands for tool making. While bipedal locomotion is an essential aspect of human evolution, it is not directly related to tool making. The development of hands and the ability to make tools are separate evolutionary adaptations.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible hypothesis is (A), as it connects tool making and language in a way that is consistent with the available evidence.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
