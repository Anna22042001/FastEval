            "model_answer": "In a Robertsonian translocation, fusion occurs at the chromosome ends. Robertsonian translocations are characterized by the fusion of two non-sister chromatids at the ends of the long arms, which results in the formation of a ring chromosome. This occurs at the points where the non-sister chromatids are joined, which can be understood as the ends of the long arms.\n\nSince translocation involves the breaking-and- rejoining of chromosomes, the fusion does not occur at the telomeres (point of chromosome ends), centromeres (point of attachment of chromatids), or histones (proteins associated with chromosomes).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) ends of the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the expected frequency of affected females, we should first recall the genetic information of X-linked recessive conditions. X-linked recessive conditions are caused by mutations in a gene located on the X chromosome. Male offspring inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father, while female offspring inherit an X chromosome from both parents. Since the Y chromosome does not carry any genes involved in the condition, males who inherit the mutated X chromosome from their mother are affected, while females who inherit the mutated X chromosome from their mother and a non-mutated one from their father are also affected.\n\nThe probability of a male inheriting the mutated X chromosome is equal to the probability of a female inheriting the mutated X chromosome. Since there is a 10% chance of a male being affected, there must also be an equal 10% chance that a female is affected. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females should be double the frequency of affected males.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(C) 0.02",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia) is a severe, life-threatening reaction to certain anesthetics and muscle relaxants during general anesthesia. It has a clear predominance in people of Northern European ancestry and does not follow the predictable patterns of a single recessive or dominant gene mutation. Since the consequences of Malignant hyperthermia can have severe outcomes, genetic testing for the causative mutation for the condition is expected to reveal that the mutation is present in the individual or family member who developed the condition. \n\nA detailed explanation of autosomal dominant inheritance, autosomal recessive inheritance, x-linked dominant inheritance, and x-linked recessive inheritance:\n\nA) Autosomal dominant inheritance occurs when an individual inherits a mutated or altered gene from one of their parents. The mutation is typically dominant, and a person with the mutation has a 50% chance of passing the mutation onto their children. In this mode of inheritance, a person with a disease-causing gene can produce an affected child even if both their partner and they themselves do not have the disease. In this scenario, only one copy of the mutated gene is needed for the phenotypic expression of the condition.\n\nB) Autosomal recessive inheritance is characterized by inheriting two mutated genes, one from each parent. A person with an autosomal recessive trait will only develop the trait if they inherit a copy of the mutated gene from both parents.\n\nC) X-linked dominant inheritance occurs when a mutated gene is located on the X chromosome. In this type of inheritance, males are more likely to exhibit the phenotype than females, as females have an extra X chromosome and generally only one of the X chromosomes carries the affected gene. Females who inherit one affected chromosome from their parent and one normal chromosome from their other parent may be carriers, but females who inherit two affected chromosomes are likely to exhibit the phenotype as well. Males, on the other hand, would only require one mutated gene to exhibit the phenotype, making them more likely to develop the condition.\n\nD) X-linked recessive inheritance is when a mutated gene is located on the X chromosome and requires the individual to have two copies of the mutated gene to express the phenotype. Males are more severely affected by x-linked recessive inheritance due to their lack of a second X chromosome, and the severity of the effects links to the location of the mutation and the number of normal X chromosomes inherited.\n\nAs the mode of inheritance of malignant hyperthermia is not classically categorized into any of the mentioned modes, taking into account the fact that it is more prevalent in certain populations, but not clearly following a specific mode, it can be inferred that the inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia is not clear-cut and may involve a more complex and variant inheritance pattern.\n\nAnswer: (X)",

Mapping Human chromosomes includes the entire set of human chromosome which includes both sex and non-sex chromosomes.\n\nB) This option states that mapping human chromosomes has been much more successful due to the availability of large numbers of DNA markers. In reality, mapping the human genome was a sequencing project, which determines the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. This process had a higher success rate due to improved technologies developed in the human genome project.\n\nC) This option mentions that mapping human chromosomes has determined the number of linkage groups to be about twice of the number of chromosomes. This statement is incorrect because linkage groups are an observed grouping of genes that are inherited together, and the concept of linkage groups is not applicable to the human chromosome sequencing strategy.\n\nD) This option implies that mapping human chromosomes have demonstrated that almost all of the DNA is involved in coding for genes. Even though it is true that the majority of the human genome consists of coding regions, it does not fully represent the entirety of the mapping process.\n\nFrom the given options, none of them fully represent the process or conclusion of the mapping of human chromosomes.
