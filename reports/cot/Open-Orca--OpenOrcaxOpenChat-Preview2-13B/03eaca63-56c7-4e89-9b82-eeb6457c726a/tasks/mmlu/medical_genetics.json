            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of:\n\n(C) a substitution.\n\nReasoning:\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation is a deletion of a single nucleotide, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508del). This mutation leads to the production of a defective CFTR protein, which impairs the function of the protein and causes the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Since the mutation involves the deletion of a single nucleotide, it is a substitution mutation.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria, we need to understand what phenylketonuria is and how it affects the child.\n\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. This disorder can lead to a buildup of phenylalanine in the body, which can cause severe intellectual disability and other health problems if not treated.\n\nThe risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria depends on the severity of the mother's condition and the level of phenylalanine in her blood. If the mother's phenylalanine levels are not well-controlled, the risk of abnormality in the child is higher.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) 1%\n(B) 10%\n(C) 25%\n(D) Almost 100%\n\n(A) 1%: This is a very low risk, and it is unlikely that the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria would have a 1% chance of abnormality.\n\n(B) 10%: This is a higher risk, but still relatively low compared to the other options. It is possible that the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria could have a 10% chance of abnormality.\n\n(C) 25%: This is a higher risk, but still relatively low compared to the other options.

However, without specific data on the mother's phenylalanine levels and the severity of her condition, it is impossible to determine the exact risk.\n\nAnswer: (B) 10%",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what the inbreeding coefficient (F) is and how it affects a population.\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient (F) is a measure of the probability of two individuals in a population being more closely related than the average. It is calculated as the probability of inheriting two identical alleles from a single parent.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population:\nWhen there is an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, the probability of inheriting two identical alleles from a single parent increases. This results in a higher proportion of homozygous individuals in the population. Since heterozygotes have one dominant and one recessive allele, their frequency will decrease with an increase in F.\n\n(B) Higher proportion of genes that show linkage:\nLinkage refers to the phenomenon where two or more genes are located close together on the same chromosome. When there is an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, the probability of inheriting two identical alleles from a single parent increases. This results in a higher proportion of homozygous individuals in the population. Since homozygous individuals have two identical alleles, the genes that are linked to each other will be inherited together more often.\n\n(C) Higher proportion of genes with introns:\nIntrons are non-coding regions of DNA that are removed during the process of RNA splicing. The presence of introns is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient.\n\n(D) Higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells:\nThe inbreeding coefficient does not directly affect the level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population",
