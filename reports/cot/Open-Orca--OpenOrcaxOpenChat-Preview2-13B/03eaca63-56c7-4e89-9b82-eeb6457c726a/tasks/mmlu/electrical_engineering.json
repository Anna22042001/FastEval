This means that the heat is produced by the flow of electrical current in a conducting material. The material does not need to be magnetic, but it must be conductive. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.",

This can lead to uneven heating and poor quality of the final product. By using a low frequency supply, the electromagnetic forces are reduced, resulting in a more stable and controlled heating process.\n\n(B) Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor at high frequencies. This means that the energy transfer between the coil and the molten metal is inefficient, leading to less effective heating. By using a low frequency supply, the magnetic coupling is improved, allowing for more efficient energy transfer and better heating of the molten metal.\n\nSo, the answer is (C) Both A and B.",
