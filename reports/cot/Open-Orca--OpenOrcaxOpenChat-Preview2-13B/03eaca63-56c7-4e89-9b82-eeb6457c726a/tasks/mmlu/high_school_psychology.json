            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(B) Schachter-Singer\n\nThe Schachter-Singer theory of emotions best explains this fact. According to this theory, emotions are a result of two factors: physiological arousal (heart racing) and cognitive labeling (recognizing the situation as a surprise party). In this case, Antoinette's heart continues to race after recognizing her friends, but she experiences happiness because she cognitively labels the situation as a surprise party. The other theories do not account for the cognitive labeling aspect of emotions.",
