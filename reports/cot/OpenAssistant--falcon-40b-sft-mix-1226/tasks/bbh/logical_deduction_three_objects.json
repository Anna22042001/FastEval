If the blue jay were the second from the left, then the quail would be to its left, which doesn't make sense with the information we have.\n\n(B) The quail is the second from the left.\nThis statement could be true because we know that the blue jay is to the right of the quail. If the quail were the second from the left, then the blue jay would be to its left, which is consistent with the information we have.\n\n(C) The falcon is the second from the left.\nThis statement could also be true because we know that the blue jay is to the right of the falcon. If the falcon were the second from the left, then the blue jay would be to its right, which is consistent with the information we have.\n\nBased on the information we have, the falcon could be the second from the left or the quail could be the second from the left, but the blue jay couldn't be.
