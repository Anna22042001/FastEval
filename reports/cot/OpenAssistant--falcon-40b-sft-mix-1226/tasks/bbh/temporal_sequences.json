            "model_answer": "Let's start by identifying the possible times when Jessica could have been at the basketball court:\n\n(A) 6pm to 9pm: This option includes the time when Sarah saw Jessica near the Statue of Liberty, so it is a possible time when Jessica could have gone to the basketball court.\n\n(B) 5am to 6am: This option includes the time when Michael saw Jessica buying clothes at the mall, but not the time when she was seen at the bike shop or train station. It is possible that she went to the basketball court during this time, but we cannot confirm it based on the information given.\n\n(C) 9pm to 10pm: This option includes the time when the basketball court was closed, so it is not possible for Jessica to have gone there during this time.\n\n(D) 2pm to 6pm: This option includes the time when Elizabeth saw Jessica taking photos near the Eiffel Tower and the time when Sean saw her waiting at the train station. It is possible that Jessica went to the basketball court during this time, but we cannot confirm it based on the information given.\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, we can conclude that the possible times when Jessica could have gone to the basketball court are (A) and (D).\n\nAnswer: (A) 6pm to 9pm and (D) 2pm to 6pm",

            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "(A) 8am to 9am looks like the best answer as Richard saw Jessica at the electronic store from 12pm to 3pm and Sarah saw them at the water park from 7pm to 10pm so 10pm - 7pm = 3 hours left in the day\n9am - 2pm = 7 hours in total that could have been used for the beach\n2pm - 5am = 19 hours in total that could have been used for the beach\n3pm - 1pm = 2 hours in total that could have been used for the beach\n3pm - 2pm = 1 hour left in the day\n(B) 12pm to 3pm, 2pm - 5am, and 3pm - 1pm all represent 2 hours each which could not possibly have been the times when Jessica went to the beach because the beach was closed at 10pm and they used 2 hours driving to get to the water park so there are only 2 hours left for actually visiting the beach.",

            "correct_answer": "(D)",
            "model_answer": "To determine the possible times Ashley could have been at the bookstore, we need to work backwards from the bookstore's closing time at 6pm. We know that the bookstore was closed before 6pm, so we can eliminate option (D) - 5am to 11am.\n\nBased on the information provided, we have three separate time ranges - Emily's sighting at 1pm to 3pm, Kim's sighting at 3pm to 6pm, and Jason's sighting at 11am to 1pm. Option (A) and (C) would overlap with these time ranges, so they can be eliminated.\n\nThat leaves us with only option (B) - between 11am to 1pm. During this time, Ashley was not sighted anywhere else, so they could have potentially gone to the bookstore. Since we only have one time range that covers the bookstore's closing time, we conclude that Ashley could have gone to the bookstore between 11am to 1pm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",
