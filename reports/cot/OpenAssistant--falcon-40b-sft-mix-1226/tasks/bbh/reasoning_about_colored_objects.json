Therefore, the purple stress ball must be on the right-hand side of the row.\n\nNow let's look for the thing that is to the left of the burgundy sunglasses. It cannot be the green pen or the purple stress ball (which are to their right), so it must be one of the other colors.\n\nThe only colors that we have not yet eliminated are grey, magenta, and silver. These colors could potentially be to the left of the burgundy sunglasses.\n\nLet's eliminate some of these options. We know that the pen is green, so if the thing to the left of the burgundy sunglasses were silver, this would create two green items in a row, which doesn't seem likely. Similarly, if the thing to the left of the burgundy sunglasses were grey, this would create a run of three grey items in a row, which is also unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option is magenta.
