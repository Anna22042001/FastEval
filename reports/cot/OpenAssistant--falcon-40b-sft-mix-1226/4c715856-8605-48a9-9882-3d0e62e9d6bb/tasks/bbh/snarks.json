            "model_answer": "(A) Her wheel wobbling several millimeters in either direction wasn't enough to suggest that the bike was unsafe\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement (A) is sarcastic because it suggests that a small amount of wobbling in the wheel is not a significant issue, even though it could potentially indicate a problem with the bike's safety. The use of the word \"unsafe\" in the statement is exaggerated and meant to convey a sense of disbelief or irony.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

In this case, the statement (B) is sarcastic because it is saying the opposite of what it actually means. The statement is implying that the person in question is not brilliant for leaving useless space junk in orbit, but rather the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "(A) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be easy is sarcastic.\n\nReasoning:\n\nSarcasm is a form of verbal irony in which the intended meaning of a statement is opposite to its literal meaning. In this case, the literal meaning of the statement is that sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband is going to be easy. However, the intended meaning is that it is going to be very difficult or impossible.\n\nThe use of the word \"easy\" in the statement is what makes it sarcastic. The word \"easy\" is often used to describe something that is simple or straightforward, but in this context, it is used to convey the opposite meaning.\n\nTherefore, (A) Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be easy is the sarcastic statement.",

            "model_answer": "The statement that is sarcastic is (A) Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe statement (A) is sarcastic because it suggests that building carriages instead of trams is a backward step, implying that trams are a more advanced and efficient form of transportation. The use of the word \"yeah\" at the beginning of the statement also adds to the sarcastic tone, as it suggests that the speaker is not actually in favor of the idea being proposed.\n\nThe statement (B) is not sarcastic because it suggests a genuine proposal to replace trams with lightrail, which is a type of modern tram system that operates on dedicated tracks and has the potential to be more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional trams.",

            "model_answer": "(A) Assuming the country that historically is constantly over throwing its government doesn't like their government is an unreasonable assumption is a sarcastic statement.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe statement (A) is sarcastic because it is making a statement that is opposite to what is expected. The statement is suggesting that it is unreasonable to assume that a country that has a history of overthrowing its government would not like its current government.
