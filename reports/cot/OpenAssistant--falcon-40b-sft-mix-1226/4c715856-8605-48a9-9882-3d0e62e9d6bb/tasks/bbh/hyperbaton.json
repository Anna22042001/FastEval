The order of adjectives is determined by their type and function.\n\nIn the sentence (A), \"enormous\" is an adjective describing the size of the monkey, while \"yellow\" and \"Egyptian\" are adjectives describing the color and origin of the monkey, respectively. The order of these adjectives is correct because they are all describing the same noun (monkey) and are in order of size, color, and origin.\n\nIn the sentence (B), \"Egyptian\" is an adjective describing the origin of the monkey, while \"yellow\" and \"enormous\" are adjectives describing the color and size of the monkey, respectively. The order of these adjectives is incorrect because \"enormous\" should come before \"yellow\" since it is describing the size of the monkey.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) enormous yellow Egyptian monkey.",

The order of adjectives in English is generally determined by their type. In this case, we have a color adjective (grey) and a nationality adjective (Chinese).\n4. The general rule for ordering adjectives is to place the color adjective before the nationality adjective. Therefore, the correct order is \"grey Chinese.\"\n5.

A descriptive adjective describes the noun, while a limiting adjective restricts or limits the meaning of the noun.\n3. In option (A), \"fiberglass\" is a descriptive adjective that describes the type of surfboard. However, \"old\" is a limiting adjective that restricts the meaning of the noun \"surfboard\" to a specific age. Therefore, the correct order would be \"old fiberglass surfboard.\"\n4. In option (B), \"old\" is a descriptive adjective that describes the age of the surfboard, while \"fiberglass\" is a limiting adjective that restricts the type of surfboard to fiberglass.

The next step is to determine the correct order of the adjectives. In English, adjectives are typically placed in a specific order, with the most important or descriptive adjective coming first. In this case, \"obnoxious\" is the most important adjective, as it describes the ship's behavior. Therefore, it should come first.\n3. Next, we can place \"small\" and \"spherical\" together, as they both describe the size and shape of the ship. \"Small\" should come first, as it is a more specific adjective.\n4. \"Red\" and \"American\" are both descriptive adjectives, but \"red\" is more specific and should come first.\n5.

In option (B), the adjectives are \"red rubber\", \"repulsive\", \"new\", \"rectangular\", and \"large\".\n2. The next step is to determine the correct order of the adjectives. In English, adjectives are typically placed in a specific order, with the most important or descriptive adjective coming first. In this case, \"red rubber\" is the most important adjective because it describes the type of material the sweater is made of. Therefore, it should come first.\n3. Next, we can place \"repulsive\" and \"new\" in any order, as they are both equally important. However, it is common to place adjectives of similar meaning together, so we can put \"repulsive\" and \"new\" together after \"red rubber\".\n4.

The adjective \"new\" comes before \"big\" because it is a more specific adjective that describes the chair.
