This means that the shape has a downward slope from left to right.\n\nThe next point is at (38.00,60.00), which is above and to the right of the first point. This means that the shape has an upward slope from bottom to top.\n\nThe next point is at (73.00,48.00), which is below and to the right of the first point.
