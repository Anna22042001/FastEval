On a branch, there are seven birds: a hawk, a raven, a hummingbird, a falcon, an owl, a quail, and a cardinal. The quail is to the left of the hummingbird. The raven is to the right of the hummingbird. The cardinal is the second from the left. The owl is to the left of the cardinal. The raven is the third from the right.

The cardinal is the second from the left.\n4. The owl is to the left of the cardinal.\n5. The raven is the third from the right.\n6. The falcon is the rightmost.\n\nBased on this information, we can create a diagram to represent the arrangement of the birds:\n```lua\nHummingbird -> Quail -> Cardinal -> Owl -> Raven -> Falcon\n```\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n(A) The hawk is the rightmost: This option is not mentioned in the paragraph, so it can be eliminated.\n\n(B) The raven is the rightmost: This option is not consistent with the information given in the paragraph. The raven is to the right of the hummingbird, but not the rightmost bird.\n\n(C) The hummingbird is the rightmost: This option is not consistent with the information given in the paragraph. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail, so it cannot be the rightmost bird.\n\n(D) The falcon is the rightmost: This option is consistent with the information given in the paragraph. The falcon is the rightmost bird.\n\n(E) The owl is the rightmost: This option is not consistent with the information given in the paragraph. The owl is to the left of the cardinal, so it cannot be the rightmost bird.\n\n(F) The quail is the rightmost: This option is not consistent with the information given in the paragraph. The quail is to the left of the hummingbird, so it cannot be the rightmost bird.\n\n(G) The cardinal is the rightmost: This option is consistent with the information given in the paragraph. The cardinal is the second from the left, so it must be the rightmost bird.\n\nTherefore, the rightmost bird is the Cardinal.\n```\nCardinal\n```",
