            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of international legal personality and its scope.\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the capacity of an entity to have legal rights and obligations under international law. States and international organizations are generally recognized as having international legal personality, which allows them to enter into international agreements, participate in international organizations, and bring claims before international courts.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited: This option suggests that individuals do have some international legal personality, but it is limited in some way. However, it is not clear what this limitation might be.\n\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality: This option suggests that individuals have the same level of international legal personality as States and international organizations. This would mean that individuals have the same rights and obligations under international law.\n\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality: This option suggests that individuals do not have any international legal personality and are not recognized as having any rights or obligations under international law.\n\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts: This option suggests that individuals can only bring claims before international courts, but it does not address the question of whether they have international legal personality.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality. This option recognizes that individuals have the same level of international legal personality as States and international organizations, which is consistent with the principle of equality before the law.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) Collective rights belong to distinct groups of people.\n\nCollective rights are those rights that are held by a group of people rather than by individuals. These rights can be held by a variety of groups, such as ethnic groups, religious groups, or other types of groups. Collective rights can include things like the right to practice a particular religion, the right to use a particular language, or the right to maintain a particular culture. These rights are often protected by laws and policies that aim to ensure that the rights of minority groups are respected and upheld.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The fundamental premise of monism theory is that (B) international and domestic law are part of the same legal order.\n\nExplanation:\n\nMonism theory is a theory in international law that holds that there is only one legal order, and that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. This means that international law is not superior to domestic law, as in (A), nor is domestic law superior to international law, as in (C). Instead, both types of law are part of the same legal system and must be interpreted and applied in a way that is consistent with each other.\n\nMonism theory is based on the idea that there is a single source of law, which is international law, and that domestic law is derived from international law. This means that domestic law must be interpreted and applied in a way that is consistent with international law, and that international law must be given effect in domestic courts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' is a doctrine used by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to ensure that the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms remains relevant and effective in changing circumstances. This principle allows the Court to interpret the Convention in light of current social, cultural, and political developments.\n\nTo determine which case best illustrates the living instrument principle, we need to analyze the facts and the Court's reasoning in each case.\n\nIn (A) Golder v UK (1978), the Court held that the United Kingdom's failure to provide a prompt and effective remedy for the deprivation of liberty of a mentally ill person violated Article 5 of the Convention. The Court's reasoning was based on the specific circumstances of the case and the Convention's text and purpose.\n\nIn (B) A v UK (2009), the Court held that the United Kingdom's retention of DNA samples and fingerprints of individuals who were not convicted of any offense violated Article 8 of the Convention. The Court's reasoning was based on the evolving nature of technology and its impact on privacy rights.\n\nIn (C) Goodwin v UK (2002), the Court held that the United Kingdom's failure to provide a mechanism for the compensation of victims of unlawful killings by the police violated Article 2 of the Convention. The Court's reasoning was based on the need to ensure effective remedies for violations of the Convention.\n\nIn (D) Osman v UK (1998), the Court held that the United Kingdom's failure to provide a legal framework for the investigation of suspicious deaths violated Article 2 of the Convention. The Court's reasoning was based on the need to ensure effective remedies for violations of the Convention.\n\nBased on the above analysis, (B) A v UK (2009) best illustrates the living instrument principle. The case involved the application of the Convention to new circumstances, namely the use of DNA technology, and the Court's reasoning was based on the evolving nature of technology and its impact on privacy rights. This case demonstrates the Court's willingness to adapt the Convention to changing circumstances and to ensure that the Convention remains an effective tool for protecting human rights.",

This means that an entity with international legal personality can sue and be sued in international courts, enter into international agreements, and participate in international organizations.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because international legal personality is not limited to States. Non-State entities such as international organizations, corporations, and individuals can also have international legal personality.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because challenging the authority of States is not a part of the definition of international legal personality.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the term \"international legal personality\" is used to denote legal persons under international law, not physical persons.",

            "model_answer": "The Kadi judgment introduced a new dimension with respect to the incorporation of UN Security Council resolutions by requiring that important UNSC resolutions be transformed and not merely incorporated.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Kadi judgment was a landmark decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2014 that dealt with the relationship between European Union (EU) law and United Nations (UN) Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. The case involved a challenge to an EU regulation that implemented a UNSC sanctions regime targeting a person named Kadi. The ECJ ruled that the regulation was invalid because it failed to provide sufficient safeguards for the rights of individuals affected by the sanctions.\n\nThe Kadi judgment did not demand that UNSC resolutions be construed in accordance with human rights (A) or that all UNSC resolutions be incorporated without any further implementing legislation (B). Instead, it focused on the need to ensure that important UNSC resolutions are transformed and not merely incorporated into EU law. This means that EU law must take into account the specific context and purpose of each UNSC resolution and ensure that it is implemented in a way that is consistent with EU values and principles, including the protection of human rights.\n\nThe Kadi judgment also did not claim that UNSC resolutions are not binding if they violate human rights (D). Instead, it emphasized the importance of ensuring that EU law is consistent with international law, including UNSC resolutions, and that the rights of individuals are protected in the implementation of these resolutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) The Kadi judgment required that important UNSC resolutions be transformed and not merely incorporated.",
