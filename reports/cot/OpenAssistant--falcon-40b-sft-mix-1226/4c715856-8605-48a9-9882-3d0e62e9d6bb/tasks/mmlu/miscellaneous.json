            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year. We can start by considering the population of the United States and the number of people who watch movies at home.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the population of the United States in 2021 was approximately 331 million people. We can assume that a significant portion of the population watches movies at home.\n\nNext, we need to consider the number of movies watched per person. According to a report by the Motion Picture Association of America, the average moviegoer in the United States watches 4.7 movies per year in theaters. However, this number does not include movies watched at home.\n\nTo estimate the number of movies watched at home, we can consider the number of households in the United States and the number of movies watched per household. According to the US Census Bureau, there were approximately 128 million households in the United States in 2021.\n\nAssuming that each household watches an average of 2 movies per week, we can estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year as follows:\n\nNumber of movies watched per week per household = 2\nNumber of movies watched per year per household = 2 * 52 = 104\nNumber of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year = 128 million households * 104 movies per household = 13.2 billion movies\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 200,000,000,000.",

            "model_answer": "The task that is best targeted at teaching students to compare quantities is (B) having students put one apple in the middle of the place mat on their desks.\n\nExplanation:\n\n(A) Having students count all the apples in the basket is not necessarily a task that focuses on comparing quantities, as it simply involves counting the total number of apples in the basket.\n\n(C) Having students make a Venn diagram for the color of the apples is not a task that focuses on comparing quantities, as it involves categorizing the apples based on their color rather than comparing the quantities of red and yellow apples.\n\n(D) Having students determine whether the numbers of red and yellow apples are equal is not necessarily a task that focuses on comparing quantities, as it involves simply checking whether the number of apples of each color is the same or not.\n\nTherefore, (B) having students put one apple in the middle of the place mat on their desks is the best task for teaching students to compare quantities, as it involves placing one apple in the middle and comparing it to the number of apples in the basket, which helps students understand the concept of more and less.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the amount of ice that is wasted in drinks each year in the United States. We can then convert this amount to energy to find the answer.\n\nAccording to a study by the National Resources Defense Council, Americans throw out about 1.3 billion pounds of ice each year. This is equivalent to about 590,000 tons of ice.\n\nNow, we need to convert this amount of ice to energy. One ton of ice is equivalent to about 3.6*10^6 J of energy. Therefore, the total amount of energy wasted by throwing out ice in drinks each year in the United States is:\n\n590,000 tons of ice * 3.6*10^6 J/ton of ice = 2.1*10^12 J\n\nThe answer is (B) 6*10^11 J.",
