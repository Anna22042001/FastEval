            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given statements are true, we need to consider the motion of a whiffle ball that is tossed straight up and falls back down under the influence of air resistance.\n\nI. The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point:\nFalse. At the highest point, the ball has reached its maximum height and is momentarily stationary. However, its speed is not necessarily zero, as it still has some horizontal velocity component.\n\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point:\nTrue. At the highest point, the net force acting on the ball is zero, as the gravitational force pulling it down is balanced by the air resistance force acting in the opposite direction. Therefore, the ball's acceleration is zero at the highest point.\n\nIII. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down:\nTrue. Since the net force acting on the ball is zero at the highest point, its velocity must also be zero. Therefore, it takes longer for the ball to reach its maximum height than it does to fall back down under the influence of gravity.\n\nAnswer: (C) I & II only.",

We are also given that the particles are 4 m apart, so r = 4 m.\n\nNow we need to find the constant of proportionality, k. The value of k depends on the units we use. In SI units, k = 1 / (4 * \u03c0 * \u03b50), where \u03b50 is the electric constant.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nF = k * (2Q * Q) / (4 m)^2\n\nNow we need to find the ratio of the electric force on A to that on B.

We also know that the magnetic force on a charged particle is proportional to the product of the charge, velocity, and magnetic field strength.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the velocity from meters per second to nanometers per second, since the radius of the circle will be given in nanometers. We can do this by multiplying the velocity by the conversion factor 1 nm/ns, where ns is nanosecond.\n\nv = 10^7 m/s * 1 nm/ns = 1 nm/ns\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula for the magnetic force:\n\nF = q(v x B)\n\nF = (1.6 \u00d7 10^-19 C)(1 nm/ns \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T)\n\nF = 8 \u00d7 10^-24 N\n\nNow, we need to calculate the radius of the circle.

The charge on an oil drop is a very small value, so any measurement with a large error margin should be rejected.\n2. The charge on an oil drop is proportional to the number of electrons it contains, so any measurement that deviates significantly from the expected number of electrons should be rejected.\n3. The charge on an oil drop can be affected by external factors such as the presence of impurities or the electric field in the laboratory, so any measurement that is inconsistent with other measurements or with theoretical predictions should be rejected.\n\nBased on these steps, we can eliminate the following measurements as highly unlikely to be correct:\n\n(A) 6.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C: This measurement is within the expected range, so it is unlikely to be incorrect.\n\n(B) 8.0 \u00d7 10^-19 C: This measurement is within the expected range, so it is unlikely to be incorrect.\n\n(C) 4.8 \u00d7 10^-19 C: This measurement is within the expected range, so it is unlikely to be incorrect.\n\n(D) 2.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C: This measurement is significantly smaller than the expected value, so it is likely to be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 2.4 \u00d7 10^-19 C.",
