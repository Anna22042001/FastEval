            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "NGS is most often used to identify quasi species viruses.\n\nExplanation:\n\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool that allows for the rapid sequencing of large amounts of DNA or RNA. It is often used to identify genetic variations, mutations, and other changes in the genome.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because NGS is not typically used to identify a newly discovered virus. While NGS can be used to sequence the genome of a virus, it is not the primary method for discovering a new virus.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because NGS is not typically used to search for drug-resistant mutants. While NGS can be used to identify mutations that confer resistance to drugs, it is not the primary method for this purpose.\n\nOption (C) is correct because NGS is most often used to identify quasi species viruses. Quasi species are groups of closely related viruses that have a high degree of genetic diversity within the group. NGS can be used to sequence the genomes of many individuals within a quasi species, allowing researchers to identify patterns of genetic variation and evolution within the group.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because NGS can be used for a variety of purposes. While it may not be suitable for some applications, it is a versatile tool that is widely used in many areas of biology and medicine.",

            "question": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for which of the following?\n\n(A) Placebo effect\n(B) Recall bias\n(C) Non-compliance\n(D) Effect modification (interaction)",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the purpose of randomization in a clinical trial. Randomization is used to assign study subjects to different groups (intervention or control) in a way that is unbiased and ensures that the groups are similar in terms of known and unknown factors that may affect the outcome of the study. This helps to control for confounding variables and reduce the risk of selection bias.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Placebo effect: Randomization does not control for the placebo effect, which is the psychological or physiological response to a placebo treatment. The placebo effect can be controlled for by using a double-blind study design, where neither the study subjects nor the researchers know which group the subjects are assigned to.\n\n(B) Recall bias: Randomization can help to control for recall bias, which is the tendency of study subjects to remember information differently based on their group assignment. By randomizing study subjects, the groups are balanced in terms of recall bias, and any differences in recall can be attributed to the intervention.\n\n(C) Non-compliance: Randomization does not control for non-compliance, which is the failure of study subjects to follow the study protocol. Non-compliance can be controlled for by using measures such as pill counts, electronic monitoring, or regular follow-up visits.\n\n(D) Effect modification (interaction): Randomization is used to control for effect modification or interaction, which is the effect of one factor (e.g., age, gender, or co-morbidities) on the effect of the intervention. By randomizing study subjects, the groups are balanced in terms of interaction, and any differences in the effect of the intervention can be attributed to the intervention itself.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is (D) Effect modification (interaction). Randomization is most helpful for controlling for effect modification or interaction in a clinical trial.",

            "correct_answer": 3,

The study design does not involve any treatment or intervention, and the participants are not blinded to the exposure.\n\nClinical trials are studies that test the effectiveness and safety of medical treatments or interventions.\n\nDouble-blind studies are studies in which neither the participants nor the researchers know which participants are receiving the treatment or placebo.\n\nLongitudinal studies are studies that follow participants over time to examine changes in a particular outcome.\n\nProspective cohort studies are a type of longitudinal study that follows a group of people over time to examine the relationship between an exposure and an outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Longitudinal.",

It has caused thousands of deaths around the world, particularly in the Middle East. MERS is considered an 'emergent' virus because it is a new virus that has emerged in recent years and has the potential to cause significant public health impact.\n\nThe other options, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), OC43, and HKU1, are all coronaviruses that have been known for many years and have not caused thousands of deaths around the world as an emergent virus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) MERS.",

This is a special feature of the rabies vaccine because it allows for the production of a safe and effective vaccine without the use of live animals.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The special feature of adaptive immunity is the ability to distinguish self and non-self.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAdaptive immunity is a type of immunity that is specific to a particular pathogen and is acquired through exposure to that pathogen. It involves the activation of B and T cells, which are lymphocytes that recognize and bind to specific antigens on the surface of pathogens. Once activated, these cells undergo clonal expansion and differentiation to produce effector cells, such as B cells that produce antibodies or T cells that can directly kill infected cells or activate other immune cells.\n\nThe ability to distinguish self and non-self is a key feature of adaptive immunity because it allows the immune system to mount an immune response against foreign pathogens while avoiding attacking the body's own cells and tissues. This is achieved through a process called central tolerance, in which developing T and B cells that recognize self-antigens are eliminated or inactivated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non-self.",

Spread by the faecal-oral route and aerosol droplet transmission are not exceptions, as they are included in the definition of MERS.\n3.

            "model_answer": "The scenario described is an example of confounding.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the scenario, the researchers conducted a case-control study to assess the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer. The study results showed a strong association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer (OR = 2.5). However, when the researchers divided the study subjects into two groups (smokers and non-smokers) and conducted subsequent statistical analysis, they did not find any association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer within either group.\n\nThis scenario is an example of confounding because the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer was initially observed in the overall study population, but it disappeared when the researchers controlled for smoking status in the subsequent analysis. This suggests that smoking status is a confounding variable that is affecting the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer.\n\nIn other words, smoking status is a variable that is associated with both alcohol consumption and lung cancer, and it is also associated with the outcome (lung cancer). When smoking status is not controlled for, it appears that alcohol consumption is associated with lung cancer, but when smoking status is controlled for, the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer disappears, indicating that smoking status is confounding the association between alcohol consumption and lung cancer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Confounding.",
