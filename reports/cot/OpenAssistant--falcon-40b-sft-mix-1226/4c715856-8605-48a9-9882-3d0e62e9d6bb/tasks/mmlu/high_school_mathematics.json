            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the area of the rectangle. We can do this by finding the length and width of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 3 units, and the width is 2 units. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 3 * 2 = 6 square units.\n\nNext, we need to determine the probability that a randomly picked point lies inside the rectangle. We can do this by finding the area of the rectangle and the area of the point. The area of the point is given by the formula for the area of a circle, which is A = \u03c0r^2. Since the radius of the circle is 1 unit, the area of the point is \u03c0 * 1^2 = \u03c0.\n\nNow, we need to determine the probability that the x-coordinate of the point is less than the y-coordinate. We can do this by finding the area of the region where the x-coordinate is less than the y-coordinate. This region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), and (x,y).\n\nTo find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is A = (b * h) / 2, where b is the base and h is the height. In this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between (0,0) and (3,0), which is 3 units. The height of the triangle is the distance between (3,0) and (x,y), which is y - x.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is (3 * y) / 2 - (x * y) / 2.\n\nNow, we need to determine the probability that the x-coordinate is less than the y-coordinate. This probability is equal to the area of the triangle divided by the area of the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the probability that x < y is (3 * y) / 2 - (x * y) / 2 / 6 = (3 - x) / 6.\n\nFinally, we can output the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else. The answer is (D) \\frac{1}{3}.",

We can do this by using trigonometry to calculate the angle of rotation.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the degrees to radians. There are 360 degrees in a full circle, and 2\u03c0 radians in a full circle. Therefore, 2250 degrees * (\u03c0/180) = 125\u03c0 radians.\n\nNext, we need to determine the direction of the spin. Since the skater is facing north when she begins to spin, we can assume that the initial direction of the spin is 0 degrees.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the angle of rotation, which is given by:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c9t\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle of rotation, \u03c9 is the angular velocity (in radians per second), and t is the time (in seconds).\n\nWe know that the angular velocity is 125\u03c0 radians per second, and we need to find the time it takes for the skater to complete her spin.
