            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which form of communication is most effective in forming or changing predispositions toward an issue, we need to consider several factors.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the type of issue being communicated. Some issues may be more complex or controversial than others, and may require more in-depth analysis and discussion. In these cases, interpersonal communication may be more effective, as it allows for more nuanced and personalized discussions.\n\nSecond, we need to consider the audience being targeted. Different audiences may respond better to different forms of communication. For example, younger audiences may be more likely to engage with social media or online content, while older audiences may prefer traditional media such as newspapers or television.\n\nThird, we need to consider the goals of the communication. If the goal is to simply raise awareness of an issue, then mass media such as television or social media may be more effective, as it can reach a large audience quickly. However, if the goal is to change attitudes or behaviors, then interpersonal communication may be more effective, as it allows for more targeted and personalized messaging.\n\nBased on these factors, I would say that interpersonal communication is the most effective form of communication for forming or changing predispositions toward an issue. This is because it allows for more nuanced and personalized discussions, and can be tailored to the specific needs and concerns of the audience.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of publics in relation to an organization. According to Esman (1972), publics are groups that have an interest in or are affected by an organization's activities. These groups can help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\n(A) Enabling publics are those that provide resources or services that are necessary for an organization's survival, such as suppliers or vendors. While they are important for an organization's success, they do not necessarily lend authority or assistance.\n\n(B) Functional publics are those that perform specific functions or services for an organization, such as employees or consultants. While they are essential for an organization's operations, they do not necessarily lend authority or assistance.\n\n(C) Normative publics are those that establish and enforce norms or standards that are important for an organization's success, such as industry associations or regulatory bodies. While they are influential, they do not necessarily lend authority or assistance.\n\n(D) Diffused publics are those that have a general interest in an organization's activities but do not have a direct relationship with it, such as the general public or media. While they can influence an organization's reputation, they do not necessarily lend authority or assistance.\n\nBased on the information provided, the answer is (C) Normative publics. Normative publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance through establishing and enforcing norms or standards that are important for its success.",

Givenchy and Lacroix are not known for having a reputation for stealing designs, so they can be eliminated as options.\n2. Chanel is known for its iconic designs and has a strong reputation, so it is unlikely to sue for damages to its reputation.\n3.

Dialogic communication is a type of communication that involves a back-and-forth exchange of ideas and perspectives, rather than a one-way transmission of information.\n3. Dialogic communication allows for a more comprehensive understanding of an issue, as it takes into account multiple perspectives and encourages critical thinking.\n4.

            "model_answer": "The main purpose of licensing public relations practitioners is to (D) achieve better wages for licensed practitioners.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLicensing public relations practitioners is a process by which individuals who meet certain qualifications and standards are granted permission to practice in the field. This process is typically designed to ensure that practitioners have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively and ethically.\n\nWhile licensing may have some impact on regulating access to posts in the field and preserving the well-being of society, these are not the primary goals of licensing public relations practitioners. Instead, the main purpose of licensing is to improve the quality of services provided by practitioners and to protect the interests of clients and the public.\n\nBy requiring practitioners to meet certain standards and to maintain their licenses through ongoing education and training, licensing can help to ensure that practitioners have the necessary skills and knowledge to provide high-quality services. This can lead to better outcomes for clients and the public, as well as improved wages for licensed practitioners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) to achieve better wages for licensed practitioners.",
