The statement mentions that most arguments for psychological egoism are nonempirical in character.\n2. This suggests that the arguments are not based on empirical evidence or scientific studies.\n3. Therefore, it is likely that the arguments are based on philosophical reasoning or other non-scientific methods.\n4. Therefore, option (D) is the most likely correct answer.\n\nThe final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else: (D)",

The categorical imperative is a synthetic a priori principle, meaning it is not derived from experience but is necessary for experience to be possible.\n\nAnalytic a priori principles, such as the principle of non-contradiction, are true by definition and do not add any new knowledge. Synthetic a posteriori principles, such as scientific laws, are based on empirical evidence and are true only insofar as they are supported by evidence.\n\nSynthetic a priori principles, such as the categorical imperative, are true independently of experience and are necessary for experience to be possible.

This is because it is natural to feel sadness and loss when a loved one passes away, but the stoic philosophy teaches that one should not let these emotions consume them or prevent them from living a virtuous life.
