            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, it seems that Brown & Harris (1978) found that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support (A).\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The study found that self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent (B).\n2. However, this finding does not necessarily mean that men and women have different levels of diagnosed depression, as the study did not directly compare the rates of diagnosed depression between men and women.\n3. Therefore, we can eliminate options C and D as they are not supported by the information provided.\n4. Option A, which states that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support, is the only remaining option that is directly supported by the information provided.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

This type of community has emerged in recent years as a result of the increasing visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n(C) sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers, is not a new form of community.

This is in contrast to the traditional Marxist view that the working class and the middle class are distinct social classes with different interests and values.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it suggests that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority, which is not necessarily related to the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because it suggests that white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace, which is not necessarily related to the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because it suggests that the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes, which is not necessarily related to the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",

This definition is consistent with Weber's broader sociological theory, which emphasizes the role of social class and status in shaping individuals' experiences and opportunities in society.\n\nOption (A) refers to the exploitation of the working class by their capitalist employers, which is a specific aspect of class relations but not the same as a class situation.\n\nOption (C) refers to a person's position in the capital, product, and labour markets, based on their economic resources.

This can be problematic from an ethical standpoint because it involves deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence. By not being upfront about your research intentions, you are violating the principle of informed consent, which is a fundamental ethical principle in research.

Leading questions are questions that suggest a certain answer or bias the respondent's response. They can be phrased in a way that prompts the respondent to answer in a particular way, which can skew the results of the survey.\n\nFor example, a leading question might be: \"Don't you think that our product is the best on the market?\" This question suggests that the product is the best and may prompt the respondent to agree, even if they don't truly believe it.\n\nTo avoid leading questions, it is important to ask open-ended questions that allow respondents to provide their own opinions and perspectives. These questions should be neutral and unbiased, and should not suggest a particular answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (C) leading questions.",
