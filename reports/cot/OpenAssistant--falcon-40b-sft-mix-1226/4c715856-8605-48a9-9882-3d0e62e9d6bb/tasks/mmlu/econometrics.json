            "model_answer": "To determine which of the given options is a plausible response to a finding of residual non-normality, we need to consider the characteristics of non-normality and the potential causes of non-normality.\n\nResidual non-normality refers to the presence of non-constant variance in the residuals of a regression model. This can result in poor model fit and inaccurate predictions. Non-normality can be caused by several factors, including heteroscedasticity, non-linear relationships between the variables, and autocorrelation.\n\nOption (A) suggests using a logarithmic functional form instead of a linear one. This option is not likely to be a plausible response to residual non-normality, as it does not address the underlying causes of non-normality.\n\nOption (B) suggests adding lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model. This option can be effective in addressing non-normality caused by autocorrelation, as it allows for the inclusion of past values of the dependent variable and the explanatory variables in the regression model. However, it may not be effective in addressing non-normality caused by heteroscedasticity or non-linear relationships.\n\nOption (C) suggests estimating the model in first differenced form. This option can be effective in addressing non-normality caused by non-linear relationships between the variables, as it removes the trend and seasonality from the data. However, it may not be effective in addressing non-normality caused by heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation.\n\nOption (D) suggests removing any large outliers from the data. This option can be effective in addressing non-normality caused by extreme values, but it may not be effective in addressing non-normality caused by heteroscedasticity or non-linear relationships.\n\nBased on the information provided, the most plausible response to residual non-normality is (B) adding lags of the variables on the right-hand side of the regression model. This option can address non-normality caused by autocorrelation, which is a common cause of non-normality in time series data.

It is often used as a loss function in regression analysis and is a popular choice for evaluating the performance of trading rules. Trading rules are strategies that use historical data to make predictions about future asset prices, and their profitability is typically measured using the MSE.\n\nThe MSE is highly correlated with trading rule profitability because it takes into account both the magnitude and the frequency of errors. A trading rule that makes frequent small errors will have a high MSE, while a trading rule that makes infrequent large errors will have a lower MSE. This means that the MSE is a good measure of the overall performance of a trading rule, as it takes into account both the accuracy and the consistency of the predictions.\n\nIn conclusion, (A) is true.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a GARCH(1,1) model is and what it can capture in financial asset return time-series.\n\nA GARCH(1,1) model is a type of volatility model used to analyze financial asset returns. It is an extension of the ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model, which is used to model the volatility of a time series. The GARCH model allows for the volatility of the returns to be modeled as a function of the past squared errors of the returns and a parameter that captures the persistence of the volatility.\n\nNow, let's consider the features of financial asset return time-series that can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution: A fat tail in a return distribution refers to the phenomenon where the probability of extreme returns is higher than what would be predicted by a normal distribution. A GARCH(1,1) model can capture this feature by allowing the volatility of the returns to be modeled as a function of the past squared errors of the returns. However, it is important to note that the GARCH model does not explicitly model the shape of the return distribution, so it may not be able to fully capture the fat tail feature.\n\nii) Leverage effects: Leverage effects refer to the phenomenon where the volatility of a financial asset's returns increases with the level of debt or leverage in the asset. A GARCH(1,1) model can capture this feature by allowing the volatility of the returns to be modeled as a function of the past squared errors of the returns and a parameter that captures the persistence of the volatility. However, the GARCH model does not explicitly model the level of leverage in the asset, so it may not be able to fully capture the leverage effects.\n\niii) Volatility clustering: Volatility clustering refers to the phenomenon where the volatility of a financial asset's returns is higher during certain periods of time than during others. A GARCH(1,1) model can capture this feature by allowing the volatility of the returns to be modeled as a function of the past squared errors of the returns and a parameter that captures the persistence of the volatility. However, the GARCH model does not explicitly model the clustering of volatility, so it may not be able to fully capture the volatility clustering feature.\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns: Volatility affecting returns refers to the phenomenon where the volatility of a financial asset's returns has a direct impact on the returns themselves. A GARCH(1,1) model can capture this feature by allowing the volatility of the returns to be modeled as a function of the past squared errors of the returns and a parameter that captures the persistence of the volatility. However, the GARCH model does not explicitly model the relationship between volatility and returns, so it may not be able to fully capture the volatility affecting returns feature.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) only",
