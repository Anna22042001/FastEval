            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to calculate the z-score for the average donation of $155. The formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (x - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nwhere x is the value we want to find the z-score for, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, x = 155, \u03bc = 155, and \u03c3 = 32.\n\nSo, z = (155 - 155) / 32 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the normal distribution curve to the left of the z-score. We can do this by using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator. The area to the left of z = 0 is approximately 0.6826.\n\nSo, the most appropriate statement is:\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.\n\nThis statement gives the range of values that includes the true mean with 95% confidence.",

It is less affected by outliers than the mean and mode, and is therefore a more accurate representation of the typical salary among teachers.\n\nThe mean (A) and mode (B) can be influenced by a few very high salaries, which may not be representative of the salaries of most teachers.\n\nThe standard deviation (C) is a measure of dispersion that represents the spread of data around the mean. It is not directly related to the typical salary among teachers.\n\nTherefore, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries to represent the typical salary among teachers and to support their argument for a salary increase.",
