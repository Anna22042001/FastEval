            "model_answer": "(B) prognathous.\n\nExplanation:\n\nPrognathism is a condition in which the lower jaw extends forward beyond the upper jaw. This can result in a forward-thrusting lower face. The other options (A) arboreal, (C) diastema, and (D) mandible are not related to the forward-thrusting lower face.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nExplanation:\n\nLevallois technology is a method of stone tool production that involves the creation of flakes from cores. This technology was developed by early humans during the Middle Paleolithic period and is characterized by the production of large, symmetrical flakes with a distinctive bulb of percussion.\n\nThe shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes is what distinguishes Levallois technology from other stone tool production methods. This shift allowed for the creation of more efficient and versatile tools, as well as the production of a wider variety of tool types.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The subfield of anthropology that aims to better understand the nearest living relatives of humans is (C) primatology.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Paleoanthropology is the study of human evolution through the analysis of fossil remains. While it can provide insights into the evolutionary history of humans and their closest living relatives, it does not focus specifically on understanding the behavior and characteristics of living primates.\n2. Archaeology is the study of past human cultures through the analysis of material culture and environmental data. While it can provide insights into the evolution of human societies, it does not focus specifically on understanding the behavior and characteristics of living primates.\n3. Primatology is the study of primates, including their behavior, ecology, and evolutionary history. This subfield of anthropology focuses specifically on understanding the behavior and characteristics of living primates, including our closest living relatives, the great apes.\n4. Linguistics is the study of language, including its structure, development, and use. While it can provide insights into the cognitive abilities of humans and other animals, it does not focus specifically on understanding the behavior and characteristics of living primates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) primatology.",

Instead, the Maya had a system of local rulers who were responsible for governing their communities. By 1900 B.P., the central elements of Mayan culture were already in place, including their religious beliefs, art, architecture, and social structure. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would have developed a stratified society ruled by kings at this time.\n\nOption (A) is correct.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The wild progenitor of maize is (C) teosinte.\n\nReasoning:\n\nMaize, also known as corn, is a domesticated crop plant that is derived from a wild grass species. The wild progenitor of maize is believed to be teosinte, a grass species native to Mexico.\n\nTeosinte has a number of characteristics that are similar to maize, including the presence of a cob-like structure and kernels. However, teosinte is a much smaller plant than maize, with smaller ears and kernels.\n\nOver time, through selective breeding and genetic modification, maize has been developed into the large, productive crop that it is today. The process of domestication has resulted in maize plants that are much larger and more productive than their wild ancestors, and that have a much higher yield of edible kernels.\n\nTherefore, the wild progenitor of maize is (C) teosinte.",

This cooling event is believed to have caused the retreat of glaciers in North America and Europe, leading to the expansion of ice sheets and the formation of the Younger Dryas boundary.\n\nThe Younger Dryas is also known as a period of environmental change that caused significant disruptions to human societies in the Northern Hemisphere. The cooling temperatures and changing climate patterns are believed to have led to the abandonment of some settlements and the decline of others.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",
