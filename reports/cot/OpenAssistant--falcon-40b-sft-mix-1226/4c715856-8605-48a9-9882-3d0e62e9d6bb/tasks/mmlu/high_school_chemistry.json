The pKa value is a measure of the strength of an acid and is defined as the negative logarithm of the dissociation constant of the acid.\n\nThe dissociation constant of an acid is the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the acid into its constituent ions in water. A lower pKa value indicates a stronger acid, as the acid is more likely to dissociate into its constituent ions in water.\n\nBased on the pKa values of the given acids, we can rank them in order of increasing strength as follows:\n\nHClO < HBrO < H2SeO3 < H2SO3\n\nExplanation:\n\nHClO has the lowest pKa value of the given acids, which indicates that it is the strongest acid. HBrO has a slightly higher pKa value than HClO, but it is still a strong acid. H2SeO3 has a higher pKa value than HBrO, indicating that it is a weaker acid.
