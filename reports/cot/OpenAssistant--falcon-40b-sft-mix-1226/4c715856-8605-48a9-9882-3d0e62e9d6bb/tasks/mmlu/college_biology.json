            "model_answer": "The complementary sequence to 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 is 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find the complementary sequence, we need to follow the rules of base pairing. In DNA, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).\n\nLooking at the first base in the given sequence, C pairs with G. Moving to the second base, G pairs with C. And finally, A pairs with T.\n\nNow, we can write the complementary sequence by replacing each base in the given sequence with its complementary base.\n\nThe complementary base for C is G, the complementary base for G is C, and the complementary base for A is T. Therefore, the complementary sequence to 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032 is 5\u2032 GCU AAC 3\u2032.",

            "model_answer": "The benefit that mycorrhizal fungi confer to many plants is (C) providing access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n\nReasoning:\n\nA) Protecting plant roots from desiccation in extremely dry habitats is not a benefit that is specific to mycorrhizal fungi, as many other organisms can also provide this protection.\n\nB) Fixing nitrogen is a benefit that some mycorrhizal fungi can provide, but it is not a benefit that is shared by all mycorrhizal fungi. Some mycorrhizal fungi do not fix nitrogen at all.\n\nD) Providing carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen is a benefit that some mycorrhizal fungi can provide, but it is not a benefit that is shared by all mycorrhizal fungi. Some mycorrhizal fungi do not engage in this type of symbiosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) providing access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.

            "model_answer": "(A) is incorrect because the Golgi apparatus is not oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. The cis face of the Golgi apparatus faces the endoplasmic reticulum, but it is not necessarily closest to it.\n\n(B) is incorrect because the small secretory vesicles are not typically associated with the cis face of the Golgi apparatus. They are located near the trans face, where they receive proteins and lipids from the Golgi apparatus.\n\n(C) is correct because the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are continuous with one another. The cisternae are connected by small tubules, allowing materials to move between them.\n\n(D) is incorrect because glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs after they enter the lumen of the Golgi apparatus.
