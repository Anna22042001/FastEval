            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between dietary fat, blood lipid metabolism, and the statements provided.\n\nFirst, we know that dietary fat can influence blood lipid metabolism. Saturated fatty acids, for example, have been shown to increase LDL cholesterol levels, while unsaturated fatty acids, such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to have a more neutral or beneficial effect on blood lipids.\n\nStatement (A) suggests that replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. This statement is consistent with the known effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on blood lipids, as they have been shown to lower triglyceride levels.\n\nStatement (B) suggests that replacing saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. This statement is not consistent with the known effects of monounsaturated fatty acids on blood lipids, as they have been shown to have a neutral or beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nStatement (C) suggests that consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. This statement is not consistent with the known effects of these dietary components, as soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nStatement (D) suggests that replacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations. This statement is not consistent with the known effects of carbohydrates on blood lipids, as carbohydrates have been shown to have a variable effect on blood lipids, depending on the type and amount consumed.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is (B).",

            "model_answer": "(A) The amount of oxygen available in the headspace of canned food is kept at a high level so as to limit losses of vitamin C is the correct statement.\n\nExplanation:\n\nVitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that is sensitive to oxidation. Canned foods are sterilized by heating them in a sealed container, which creates a high-pressure environment that prevents the growth of microorganisms. However, this process also causes some loss of vitamin C due to oxidation. To limit this loss, canned food manufacturers typically add a small amount of oxygen to the headspace of the can before sealing it. This oxygen helps to maintain the vitamin C content of the food by preventing oxidation.\n\nReheating canned vegetables before serving only causes small losses of vitamin C (B) is incorrect because reheating can actually cause significant losses of vitamin C, especially if the vegetables are overcooked.\n\nLosses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables (C) is incorrect because losses of vitamin C can vary depending on the type of food and the processing method used. Some canned fruits may have higher losses of vitamin C than canned vegetables, but this is not always the case.\n\nLosses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small (D) is incorrect because losses of vitamin C can occur during storage at ambient temperature, especially if the cans are not properly sealed or if they are exposed to light.",

Aspartate is another non-essential amino acid that is synthesized in the body and plays a role in various metabolic processes, including the production of neurotransmitters and the synthesis of proteins and other molecules.\n3.

It is also involved in the synthesis of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant.\n4. Alanine is a non-essential amino acid that is synthesized in the body, but it can also be obtained from dietary sources.

This process is facilitated by specific transporter proteins located on the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nOne of the key factors that influences the absorption of glucose is the presence of sodium ions. Sodium ions are actively transported into the intestinal epithelial cells along with glucose, creating a concentration gradient that drives the absorption of glucose. This process is known as active transport and is facilitated by the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) located on the brush border membrane.\n\nTherefore, statement (A) is the most correct statement about the absorption of glucose from the GI tract.",
