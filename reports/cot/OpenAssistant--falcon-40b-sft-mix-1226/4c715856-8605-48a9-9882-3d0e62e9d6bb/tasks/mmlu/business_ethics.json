            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Predatory pricing is a pricing strategy used by a dominant firm to drive out competitors from the market. The idea is to set prices below cost in order to force smaller competitors out of business. Once the competitors are eliminated, the dominant firm can then raise prices to recoup its losses and earn higher profits.\n\nTo determine the best answer, we need to consider the different types of predatory pricing. The most common type is \"loss leader pricing,\" where a firm sets prices below cost for a popular product in order to attract customers to its store. Once customers are in the store, they may be tempted to buy other products at regular prices, allowing the firm to recoup its losses.\n\nAnother type of predatory pricing is \"predatory discounting,\" where a firm offers deep discounts on a product in order to drive out competitors. The idea is that the competitors cannot afford to match the discounts and will eventually go out of business.\n\nBased on the information provided, the best answer is (A) 1,2,4. This option includes both loss leader pricing and predatory discounting, which are the two most common types of predatory pricing.",
