            "question": "If XYZ Corporation buys an original Matisse painting to hang in its board room then\n\n(A) GDP decreases by the amount of the purchase because C decreases.\n(B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.\n(C) GDP is unaffected because it is a second hand sale.\n(D) GI)P decreases because I decreases.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The purchase of an original Matisse painting by XYZ Corporation would not affect GDP because it is a second-hand sale.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGDP (gross domestic product) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. When a company buys an asset, such as a painting, from another company or individual, it is a second-hand sale and does not contribute to GDP because no new production has occurred.\n\nIn this case, XYZ Corporation is buying an original Matisse painting from an individual or company, so it is a second-hand sale. Therefore, the purchase of the painting would not affect GDP because no new production has occurred.\n\nAnswer: (C) GDP is unaffected because it is a second-hand sale.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The government collects money from taxes and spends money on various programs and services. If the government collects more money in net taxes than it spends, it means that it has a budget surplus. This is because the government has more money coming in than going out.\n\nA current account deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports. A trade surplus occurs when a country exports more goods and services than it imports. A budget deficit occurs when a government spends more money than it collects in taxes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) a budget surplus.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be (D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA negative supply shock occurs when there is a sudden decrease in the availability or increase in the price of inputs used in production, which leads to a decrease in the quantity of output produced. This type of shock can have a significant impact on the economy, as it can cause prices to rise and lead to a decrease in economic growth.\n\nOf the given options, (D) unexpectedly higher resource prices is the best example of a negative supply shock. This occurs when the prices of inputs such as oil, gas, or other raw materials increase unexpectedly, which can make it more expensive for firms to produce goods and services. This can lead to a decrease in the quantity of output produced and an increase in prices, which can have a negative impact on the economy.\n\nOption (A) is not a good example of a negative supply shock, as a decrease in government spending can have a negative impact on the economy, but it is not a supply shock. Option (B) is also not a good example, as a decrease in the real interest rate can have an impact on investment and consumption, but it is not a supply shock. Option (C) is not a good example, as an increase in the money supply can have an impact on inflation and economic growth, but it is not a supply shock.\n\nTherefore, the best example of a negative supply shock to the economy would be (D) unexpectedly higher resource prices.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine which of the lists contains only Fed actions that will increase the money supply, we need to understand how each action affects the money supply.\n\nRaising reserve requirements means that banks must hold a higher percentage of their deposits as reserves, reducing the amount of money available for lending. This action tends to decrease the money supply.\n\nLowering the discount rate means that banks can borrow money from the Fed at a lower interest rate, encouraging them to lend more money to borrowers. This action tends to increase the money supply.\n\nSelling bonds means that the Fed is withdrawing money from the banking system, reducing the money supply.\n\nBuying bonds means that the Fed is injecting money into the banking system, increasing the money supply.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate (A) and (C) as options, as they both involve actions that tend to decrease the money supply.\n\nOption (B) involves both increasing the discount rate and buying bonds, which have opposite effects on the money supply. Therefore, we cannot determine whether this option would increase or decrease the money supply based on the information provided.\n\nOption (D) involves both lowering the discount rate and buying bonds, which would both tend to increase the money supply. Therefore, this option is the most likely to contain only Fed actions that will increase the money supply.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Tariffs and quotas are trade policies that can affect domestic prices.\n\nTariffs are taxes on imports, which can increase the price of imported goods. When the price of imported goods goes up, domestic producers can sell their goods at a higher price without losing customers to foreign competition. This can lead to higher domestic prices.\n\nQuotas, on the other hand, limit the amount of a good that can be imported. When the supply of a good is restricted, its price can increase. However, the effect of quotas on domestic prices is not as straightforward as that of tariffs. If the quota is set below the level of demand, domestic prices may actually decrease because consumers will have to pay less for the limited supply of the good.\n\nIn summary, tariffs can increase domestic prices, while quotas can have a more complex effect on domestic prices, depending on whether the quota is set above or below the level of demand.",

The question asks us to determine which of the following statements is true when real GDP increases:\n\n(A) prices are higher\n(B) employment is higher\n(C) production is higher\n(D) prices and/or output is higher\n\nWe can eliminate (A) and (B) right away because they are not directly related to real GDP. Real GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced in an economy, so it does not necessarily imply that prices are higher or that employment is higher.\n\nNow let's consider (C) and (D). When real GDP increases, it is likely that production has also increased. This is because higher output implies that more goods and services are being produced in the economy. Therefore, we can conclude that (C) is true.\n\nHowever, (D) is a bit more tricky. We cannot say for sure that prices and/or output are higher when real GDP increases. It is possible that prices have remained the same or even decreased, while output has increased. Alternatively, output could have increased while prices have also increased.
