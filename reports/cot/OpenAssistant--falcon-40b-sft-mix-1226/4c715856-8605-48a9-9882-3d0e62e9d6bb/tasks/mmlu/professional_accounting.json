            "model_answer": "(A) Acceptance of a client relationship.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice are designed to ensure that audits are conducted in accordance with professional standards and regulations. One of the key elements of these policies and procedures is the acceptance of a client relationship.\n\nAcceptance of a client relationship involves the initial evaluation of a potential client and the decision to accept or reject the engagement. This process includes assessing the risks associated with the engagement, determining the firm's ability to perform the engagement, and considering any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nProfessional skepticism of management is an important aspect of auditing, but it is not a specific policy or procedure that is included in a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures. Instead, it is a general principle that guides the conduct of audits.\n\nComputer information processing and efficiency of organizational structures are also important aspects of a CPA firm's operations, but they are not directly related to the firm's auditing practice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Acceptance of a client relationship.",

In most jurisdictions, this right is not absolute and is subject to certain conditions.\n\nOne of the conditions that may apply is the requirement that the demanding shareholder own a certain amount of stock in the corporation. This is known as the \"inspection threshold\" or \"minimum ownership requirement.\" The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that only shareholders with a significant financial stake in the corporation have the right to inspect its books and records.\n\nIn the given options, option (B) is the correct answer.

The positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is also included in comprehensive income, so we can ignore it.\n\nThe $3,000 unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities is not included in comprehensive income, as it is a temporary decline in the value of an investment that has not yet been realized.\n\nThe positive $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment is included in comprehensive income, as it represents a gain or loss on foreign currency transactions that have been translated into the company's functional currency.\n\nFinally, the $6,000 increase in common stock is not included in comprehensive income, as it is a change in equity resulting from an investment by owners.\n\nTherefore, Palmyra's comprehensive income is $11,000 + $2,000 = $13,000.\n\nThe answer is (C) $11,000.",

We can do this by first calculating the interest expense on the loan, then adding the commitment fee to the interest expense to get the effective annual interest cost.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the interest expense on the loan. We can do this by multiplying the loan amount by the interest rate:\n\nInterest expense = $200,000 * 0.1 = $20,000\n\nNext, we need to calculate the compensating balance. We can do this by multiplying the loan amount by the compensating balance rate:\n\nCompensating balance = $200,000 * 0.15 = $30,000\n\nNow we need to add the commitment fee to the interest expense to get the effective annual interest cost. We can do this by multiplying the interest expense by the commitment fee rate:\n\nCommitment fee = $200,000 * 0.01 = $2,000\n\nEffective annual interest cost = Interest expense + Commitment fee = $20,000 + $2,000 = $22,000\n\nNow we need to compare the effective annual interest cost to the given answer choices to determine which one is closest.\n\nAnswer choice A is 11.5 percent, which is less than the effective annual interest cost of $22,000.\n\nAnswer choice B is 15 percent, which is greater than the effective annual interest cost of $22,000.\n\nAnswer choice C is 26.5 percent, which is greater than the effective annual interest cost of $22,000.\n\nAnswer choice D is 13.53 percent, which is closest to the effective annual interest cost of $22,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 13.53 percent.",
