            "model_answer": "The AIDA model stands for awareness, interest, desire, and action.\n\nThe first step in the AIDA model is to create awareness of a product or service. This can be done through advertising, marketing, or other forms of communication.\n\nOnce a person is aware of a product or service, they may become interested in it. This is the second step in the AIDA model. Interest can be generated through product demonstrations, testimonials, or other forms of communication that highlight the benefits and features of the product or service.\n\nThe third step in the AIDA model is to create a desire for the product or service. This can be done by highlighting the unique selling points of the product or service and emphasizing how it can meet the needs or wants of the target audience.\n\nFinally, the fourth step in the AIDA model is to take action.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The importance and significance of customer experience to both individuals and society is referred to as the \"Experience Economy.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe term \"Experience Economy\" was coined by Pine and Gilmore in their book of the same name, published in 1999. The authors argue that the shift from a goods-based economy to a service-based economy to an experience-based economy is the next logical step in the evolution of economic value.\n\nIn a goods-based economy, the focus is on the production and sale of physical products. In a service-based economy, the focus shifts to the delivery of services, which are intangible and often involve interactions between people. In an experience-based economy, the focus is on creating memorable and meaningful experiences for customers.\n\nThe importance and significance of customer experience to both individuals and society can be seen in several ways:\n\n1. Customer satisfaction: A positive customer experience can lead to increased customer satisfaction, which can result in increased loyalty and repeat business.\n2. Brand reputation: A positive customer experience can enhance a company's reputation and image, leading to increased brand value and market share.\n3. Economic growth: The experience economy can drive economic growth by creating new jobs and opportunities in the service sector, as well as by stimulating demand for goods and services.\n4. Social impact: A positive customer experience can have a positive impact on society by promoting social interaction, community building, and personal growth.\n\nBased on the above, the answer to the question is (C) Experience economy.",
