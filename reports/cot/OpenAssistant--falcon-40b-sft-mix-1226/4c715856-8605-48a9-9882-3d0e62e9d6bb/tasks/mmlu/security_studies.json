            "question": "What are the themes that make post-structuralism a different field of study and why is it criticized?\n\n(A) One of the founding assumptions of Critical Security Studies is that theories about the world constitute that world and thus that theory, including security theory, has political effects. The consequence is that theory is the product of the system, and that analyses of the agent of security and the referent object is produced by its own practices.\n(B) Central to the political and critical nature of post-structural literature is the idea of fostering an ethos of democracy and an ethos of critique which is finite and attainable. It is to this end that we must strive, but one that can only be met under the conditions prescribed, that of true democracy.\n(C) A central notion of critique is to provide an answer to the problem of what it means to be critical. This invariably raises the question of revealing the interest behind knowledge claims with the goal of social change, what is accepted as the end of theory: that the practical and contextual understandings inform to whom knowledge claims serve.\n(D) Poststructuralism accepts the form and foundations for knowledge claims that dominate the security studies debate. This has brought it into confrontation with the critical studies community, having little to contribute to the understanding of the ways in which knowledge is constructed.",

            "question": "Since the end of the Cold War, how has the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers changed?\n\n(A) Coercive diplomacy has proven a successful policy tool and one that is integral to conflict management. The successes of the past policy initiatives in the post-9/11 community have reinforced the trend toward coercive diplomacy by increasing American political will to counter mass casualty terrorism in failing states.\n(B) The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.\n(C) The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat. Risk of uncontrollable escalation still remains but in a different form; mass casualty terrorism, contagion from failing states and non-state actors seeking to acquire WMD are the primary concern of states and require responses in the form of military intervention.\n(D) The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.",

Based on the statements provided, the following can be said:\n\n(A) The international system is shaped through colonised discourse that establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others.\nThis statement is true within the postcolonial approach. The postcolonial approach argues that the international system is shaped by the power dynamics between colonizers and colonized, and that the discourse of colonialism has established a hierarchy of states, with the colonizers at the top and the colonized at the bottom. This hierarchy continues to shape international relations today.\n\n(B) European practices of free trade and democracy are best suited to creating a peaceful and stable international system.\nThis statement is not necessarily true within the postcolonial approach. While the postcolonial approach recognizes the importance of free trade and democracy, it also recognizes that these practices have been used as tools of colonialism and imperialism in the past.

While the end of the Second World War and the dissolution of the British Empire marked the end of formal colonialism, the postcolonial approach argues that the legacy of colonialism continues to shape international relations today. The postcolonial approach emphasizes the need to address the ongoing effects of colonialism, such as economic inequality and cultural imperialism.\n\n(D) Colonial power exists only through the military actions of occupying states.\nThis statement is not necessarily true within the postcolonial approach.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe liberalist approach, also known as liberal internationalism, is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the importance of cooperation, diplomacy, and international institutions in maintaining peace and stability. It is based on the idea that states should work together to resolve conflicts and promote common interests, rather than resorting to force or unilateral action.\n\nThe purported limitations of the liberalist approach include:\n\nA. Liberalism poses great difficulty in defining when the use of force would be justified or necessary. This is because liberalism emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and negotiation, and it can be difficult to determine when force is necessary to protect vital interests.\n\nB. Liberalism is often internally inconsistent, limiting its applicability for use as a guide. This is because liberalism emphasizes the importance of individual rights and freedoms, but it can be difficult to reconcile these values with the need to maintain order and security in the international system.\n\nC. A failure to address the importance of a wide range of actors in the decision-making processes of the international system. This is because liberalism focuses on the role of states in international relations, and it can be difficult to incorporate the perspectives of non-state actors, such as international organizations and non-governmental organizations, into the decision-making process.\n\nD. Liberalist influence merely reflects Western dominance, potentially undermining its relevance in the future. This is not a limitation of the liberalist approach itself, but rather a criticism of its historical context and application.
