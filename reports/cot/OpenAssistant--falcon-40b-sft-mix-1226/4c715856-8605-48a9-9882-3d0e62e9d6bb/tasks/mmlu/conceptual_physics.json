            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(D) All of these.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Albert Einstein. It predicts that the presence of matter and energy causes a curvature in the fabric of spacetime, which in turn affects the motion of objects within it.\n\nLight is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and it is affected by gravity according to general relativity. When light passes near a massive object like the Sun, its path is curved by the curvature of spacetime. This is known as gravitational lensing.\n\nIn addition, the speed of light is affected by the presence of matter and energy. According to general relativity, the speed of light is reduced when it passes through a region of spacetime with a high energy density, such as near the Sun. This is known as the gravitational redshift.\n\nFinally, general relativity predicts that time runs slower in the vicinity of a massive object like the Sun. This is due to the fact that time is affected by the curvature of spacetime, and the curvature is greater near the Sun.\n\nTherefore, all of the options (A), (B), (C) are correct predictions of general relativity.",

This current creates a voltage across the loop, which is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field.\n\nThe electric field is created by the moving charges in the wire, which are induced by the changing magnetic field. This electric field interacts with the charges, causing them to move and creating a current.\n\nSo, in summary, when you change the magnetic field in a closed loop of wire, it creates a current, a voltage, and an electric field.",

The color wheel is a visual representation of the relationships between colors. It shows how colors can be combined to create different shades and tones.\n\nBlue is a primary color, which means it cannot be created by mixing other colors. The complementary color of blue is therefore not a mixture of other colors, but a pure color that is opposite to blue on the color wheel.\n\nThe complementary color of blue is cyan. Cyan is a mixture of blue and green, which are the two colors that are opposite to each other on the color wheel. When blue and green are mixed in equal amounts, they create cyan.\n\nTherefore, the complementary color of blue is (C) cyan.",

            "model_answer": "The color of light that we see when we look at the red petals of a rose is (C) white minus red.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe color of an object is determined by the wavelengths of light that it absorbs and reflects. When we look at a red rose, we see the color red because the rose is absorbing all the colors of light except for red, which it reflects back to our eyes.\n\nThe color of light that is reflected back to our eyes is called the complementary color of the color that is absorbed. In the case of a red rose, the complementary color is green. However, the color that we see is not actually green, but rather a combination of all the colors in the visible spectrum minus the red. This is known as white minus red, or simply white.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) white minus red.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) flying faster than sound.\n\nReasoning:\n\nA sonic boom is created when an object travels faster than the speed of sound, which is approximately 343 meters per second (m/s) at sea level. When an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound, it creates a shock wave that travels ahead of the aircraft and can be heard as a loud boom on the ground.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because breaking the sound barrier refers to the moment when an object travels faster than the speed of sound, not the time when it is producing a sonic boom.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because a subsonic dive is when an aircraft descends at a speed slower than the speed of sound.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because all of the options listed can produce a sonic boom.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "A barometer that uses water instead of mercury will be (C) equal in height.\n\nReasoning:\n\nA barometer is a device used to measure atmospheric pressure. It typically consists of a glass tube filled with a liquid, such as mercury or water, and a scale to indicate the pressure. The height of the liquid in the tube is proportional to the pressure, so the higher the liquid level, the higher the pressure.\n\nIf a barometer uses water instead of mercury, the height of the liquid in the tube will be the same as if it used mercury, as long as the density of the water is the same as the density of mercury. Water has a density of about 1 g/cm^3, which is similar to the density of mercury (about 1.4 g/cm^3). Therefore, the height of the liquid in the tube will be the same, and the barometer will be the same height regardless of which liquid is used.\n\nAnswer: (C) equal in height.",

This reaction is a series of nuclear reactions that occur in the sun and other stars, and it is responsible for producing most of the energy released by these stars.\n\nIn the proton-proton chain reaction, two protons fuse together to form a deuteron, which is a nucleus of a hydrogen isotope with one proton and one neutron. The deuteron then undergoes a beta decay, in which the neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron, and the electron is emitted from the nucleus. This process releases a gamma ray, which is a type of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) gamma radiation.",

            "model_answer": "(C) appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nGravitational force on satellites in circular Earth orbit is weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface because the satellite is moving at a constant speed and is constantly falling towards Earth, but due to its circular motion, it misses the Earth and continues to fall towards the center of the Earth. This means that the gravitational force is constantly pulling the satellite towards the Earth, but the satellite is constantly moving away from the Earth, so the net force on the satellite is much weaker than if it were stationary on the Earth\u2019s surface.",
