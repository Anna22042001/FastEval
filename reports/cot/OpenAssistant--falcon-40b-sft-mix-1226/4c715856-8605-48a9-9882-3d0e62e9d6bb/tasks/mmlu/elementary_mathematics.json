We can do this by finding the time when Bus A has traveled 15 minutes, which is the same distance as Bus B's route.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of times Bus A leaves the station in an hour. We can do this by dividing the number of minutes in an hour (60) by the time interval between Bus A's departures (75 minutes):\n\nNumber of times Bus A leaves in an hour = 60 minutes / 75 minutes = 0.8 times/hour\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of times Bus B leaves the station in an hour. We can do this by dividing the number of minutes in an hour (60) by the time interval between Bus B's departures (15 minutes):\n\nNumber of times Bus B leaves in an hour = 60 minutes / 15 minutes = 4 times/hour\n\nNow, we need to find the time when Bus A has traveled 15 minutes, which is the same distance as Bus B's route. We can do this by dividing the distance Bus A travels in 15 minutes (0.8 times/hour * 15 minutes/time) by the distance Bus B travels in 15 minutes (15 minutes/time):\n\nDistance Bus A travels in 15 minutes = 0.8 times/hour * 15 minutes/time = 1.2 times/hour\n\nDistance Bus B travels in 15 minutes = 15 minutes/time\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion to find the time when Bus A and Bus B will leave the station at the same time:\n\n1.2 times/hour / 15 minutes/time = 0.08 times/hour\n\nSolving for time, we get:\n\nTime = 0.08 times/hour * 60 minutes/time = 4.8 minutes\n\nSince the answer choices are in hours, we need to convert the time to hours. One hour is equal to 60 minutes, so we can divide the time in minutes by 60 to find the time in hours:\n\nTime in hours = 4.8 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.08 hours\n\nThe next time Bus A and Bus B will leave the station at the same time is:\n\nAnswer: (B) 7:15 a.m.",
