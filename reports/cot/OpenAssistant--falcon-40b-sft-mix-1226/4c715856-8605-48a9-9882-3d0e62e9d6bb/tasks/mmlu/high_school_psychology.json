Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The James-Lange theory of emotions best explains this fact. According to this theory, emotions are the result of physiological arousal and the interpretation of that arousal. In this case, Antoinette's heart begins to race when she is surprised by her friends, which is the physiological arousal. Her interpretation of this arousal as a sign of danger leads to her experiencing fear. Once she realizes that the surprise is not a threat, her interpretation of the arousal changes to happiness, and she experiences the emotion of happiness.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "(A) dilation of the pupils is not a characteristic of physiological arousal.\n\nDilation of the pupils is a characteristic of the fight or flight response, which is a type of physiological arousal. However, physiological arousal can occur in response to a variety of stimuli, and not all stimuli that elicit physiological arousal will also cause dilation of the pupils. For example, exposure to bright light can cause dilation of the pupils, but it is not a type of physiological arousal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

(A) no parent would permit a child to participate in such a study is not a valid reason because the study could be conducted with the consent of the parents.\n2. (C) babies are too young to fear small animals is not a valid reason because babies can be conditioned to fear small animals at a young age.\n3. (D) conditioning experiments are no longer done is not a valid reason because conditioning experiments are still conducted in psychology research.\n4.

Curriculum-based assessments are used to evaluate a student's progress in specific academic areas.\n\nEcological assessments, on the other hand, attempt to understand the complex interactions between an individual and their environment. This type of assessment looks at the various factors that may be contributing to a behavioral problem, such as family dynamics, social relationships, and physical environment. By doing so, it aims to identify the most pressing behavioral problem and possible ways to alleviate it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Ecological.",

The reciprocity norm is a social norm that suggests people feel obligated to return favors or gifts they have received. In this case, Brittany felt obligated to send a donation to the organization that sent her address stickers because she had received a gift from them. This is consistent with the reciprocity norm, which suggests that people feel a sense of obligation to return favors or gifts they have received.

According to this theory, the most important part of the brain in the experience of emotion is the limbic system, which includes several structures such as the amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus.\n\nThe amygdala is involved in the processing of emotional information, particularly fear and aggression.

The somatosensory cortex (A) is responsible for processing sensory information from the body, including touch, pressure, and pain. The medulla oblongata (C) is a part of the brainstem that controls essential functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.
