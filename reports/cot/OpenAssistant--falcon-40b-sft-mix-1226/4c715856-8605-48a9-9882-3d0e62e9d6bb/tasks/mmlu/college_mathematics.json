To integrate the force vector along this path, we can use the formula for the work done by a force:\n\nW = F * d\n\nwhere W is the work done, F is the force vector, and d is the displacement vector.\n\nTo find the displacement vector, we can differentiate the path of the particle with respect to time:\n\nd = (1, 2t, 3t^2)\n\nNow we can plug in the components of the force vector and the displacement vector to find the work done by F:\n\nW = (-1, 0, 1) * (1, 2t, 3t^2)\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can use the chain rule and the product rule:\n\nW = (-1 * 1) + (0 * 2t) + (1 * 3t^2)\n\nW = -1 + 0 + 3t^2\n\nNow we can evaluate this expression at time t=1:\n\nW = -1 + 0 + 3(1)^2\n\nW = -1 + 0 + 3\n\nThe work done by F on the particle is 3.\n\nThe answer is (D) sqrt(2).",

Then, we can write P = I * k, where k is a scalar. Substituting this into P^2 = P, we get I^2 = k^2 * I, which implies that k^2 = 1.

If P is diagonalizable, then it has a diagonal matrix representation with non-zero diagonal entries. Substituting this into P^2 = P, we get (diag(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n))^2 = (diag(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)) for some non-zero scalars a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
