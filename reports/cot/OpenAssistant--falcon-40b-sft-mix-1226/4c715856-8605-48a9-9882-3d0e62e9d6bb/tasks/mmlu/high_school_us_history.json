            "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nAt a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nThe perspective of the passage above would most directly support which of the following political goals?\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n(B) Trust-busting\n(C) Greater rights for unions\n(D) Weakening political machines",

            "model_answer": "The passage describes the establishment of a boarding club for working girls who were participating in a strike at a shoe factory. The club was established to provide a safe and supportive environment for these women, who were particularly vulnerable to being intimidated into returning to work. This suggests that the political goal most directly supported by the passage is:\n\n(A) Women's suffrage\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe passage does not mention anything about trust-busting, greater rights for unions, or weakening political machines. Therefore, these options can be eliminated.\n\nOption (B) is also not supported by the passage. While the boarding club may have provided some economic benefits to the women involved, it was primarily established to provide a safe and supportive environment for them during the strike.\n\nOption (C) is somewhat supported by the passage, as the boarding club was established to help the women stand up for their rights and negotiate better working conditions. However, the focus of the passage is on the establishment of the boarding club itself, rather than on the broader labor movement.\n\nOption (D) is not supported by the passage. The establishment of the boarding club was not specifically aimed at weakening political machines, and there is no indication that it had any impact on the political power of these machines.\n\nTherefore, the most direct political goal supported by the passage is:\n\n(A) Women's suffrage",

This option is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention any government involvement in the development of the rail system.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the entire national rail system was planned before the first railway was constructed.

This is a time of challenge to our interests and our values and it's a time that tests our wisdom and skills.\nAt this time in Iran, 50 Americans are still held captive, innocent victims of terrorism and anarchy. Also at this moment, massive Soviet troops are attempting to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of Afghanistan. These two acts\u2014one of international terrorism and one of military aggression\u2014present a serious challenge to the United States of America and indeed to all the nations of the world. Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right.

However, the passage does not mention any direct military intervention by the United States in the Middle East or any other region.\n\nFurthermore, the passage mentions that Carter faced these challenges \"squarely and courageously\" and that he was determined to meet them with \"the best that is in us.\" This suggests that Carter was able to successfully address these challenges and maintain his popularity with the American public, which ultimately led to his victory in the 1980 presidential election.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome of the situation described by Carter was his victory in the next presidential election, rather than any of the other options listed.",

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it.

This policy was likely the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which was signed in 1868 and guaranteed Indian possession of lands west of the Mississippi River. However, the Treaty of Fort Laramie did not involve the tribes of the Southeast, and it was not a negotiated settlement between the tribes and the U.S. government.\n\nThe policy described in the passage most closely matches the policy of the Indian Removal Act, which was passed by Congress in 1830 and forced the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole tribes to move west of the Mississippi River. This policy was intended to open up land in the Southeast for white settlement and was met with resistance from the tribes, who were not represented in Congress and did not consent to the removal.

Ferguson, which upheld the constitutionality of segregation laws. The case involved a challenge to a Louisiana law that required separate railway cars for black and white passengers. The Court ruled that segregation was constitutional as long as the facilities were equal in quality. This decision became the legal foundation for segregation in the United States and remained in effect until it was overturned by the Supreme Court in Brown v.
