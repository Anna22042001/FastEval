            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This mutation is known as \u0394F508 and is found in approximately 70% of cystic fibrosis patients.\n\nExplanation:\n\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein. The most common mutation, \u0394F508, is a deletion of three nucleotides in exon 10 of the CFTR gene, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 in the CFTR protein. This mutation is associated with reduced or absent CFTR protein function, leading to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis, including thickened mucus in the lungs and digestive system, and impaired pancreatic function.\n\nThe other options (A) a duplication, (B) a substitution, and (D) an insertion) are not the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, as they do not result in the loss of a phenylalanine residue in the CFTR protein.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To solve this question, we need to understand the concept of heritability and how it is calculated. Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance (the total variation in a trait) that is due to genetic factors. In other words, it measures the extent to which genetic differences between individuals explain the differences in the trait.\n\nIn twin and family studies, heritability is typically estimated using the variance component method, which involves comparing the phenotypic variance between identical (monozygotic) twins and non-identical (dizygotic) twins. The difference in phenotypic variance between the two groups is attributed to genetic factors.\n\nNow, let's consider genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These studies examine the association between genetic variants (SNPs) and a trait. The SNPs that are significantly associated with the trait are then used to predict an individual's risk of developing the trait.\n\nHowever, the SNPs identified in GWAS only explain a small proportion of the heritability of the trait. This is known as the \"missing heritability\" problem. The reason for this is that most genetic variants have a very small effect on the trait, and these small effects are difficult to detect in GWAS.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) as they are too low. Option (C) is also incorrect as it is too high. Therefore, the correct answer must be (D) less than 2%.",

If left untreated, high levels of phenylalanine can cause brain damage and intellectual disability.\n\nIf a mother with PKU becomes pregnant, her unborn child has a high risk of developing PKU and other birth defects. The risk of having a child with PKU is about 1 in 10 if both parents have PKU. If only one parent has PKU, the risk is about 1 in 100.\n\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is 25%, which is option (C).",

LDL is a type of cholesterol that can build up in the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nThe gene responsible for Familial hypercholesterolaemia is the gene that encodes HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver. Mutations in this gene can cause the enzyme to be overactive, leading to an increase in cholesterol production and a subsequent increase in LDL levels.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) HMG-CoA reductase.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what QTL analysis is and what it is used for.\n\nQTL analysis, or quantitative trait locus analysis, is a method used in genetics to identify the genetic loci responsible for a complex trait in a population. A complex trait is a trait that is influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors, such as height, weight, or disease susceptibility.\n\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\n\n(A) identify chromosome regions associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross: This is the correct answer. QTL analysis is used to identify the chromosomal regions that are associated with a complex trait in a genetic cross. In a genetic cross, two individuals with different alleles for a particular gene are crossed, and their offspring are analyzed for the expression of the trait. By analyzing the offspring, we can identify the chromosomal regions that are associated with the expression of the trait.\n\n(B) determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage: This is not the correct answer. QTL analysis is not used to determine which genes are expressed at a developmental stage.\n\n(C) map genes in bacterial viruses: This is not the correct answer. QTL analysis is not used to map genes in bacterial viruses.\n\n(D) identify RNA polymerase binding sites: This is not the correct answer. QTL analysis is not used to identify RNA polymerase binding sites.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

It is typically derived from yeast or bacteria, but it is not a bacterial chromosome.\n\nBacterial chromosomes contain genes that are specific to bacteria, and they do not typically contain human genes.\n\nThe F factor is a type of plasmid that is commonly found in bacteria. It contains genes that are involved in conjugation, which is the process by which bacteria transfer DNA to one another.\n\nTherefore, the Hfr strain of E. coli contains a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted, which allows it to transfer DNA to other bacteria.",

It is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited from the mother.\n\nMitochondria are organelles found in cells that are responsible for producing energy for the cell. They have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus of the cell. Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA can cause a variety of disorders, including LHOA.\n\nChromosomes 12, 18, and 21 are located in the nucleus of the cell and are not involved in LHOA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) mitochondrial DNA.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\n\nExplanation:\n\nInbreeding is the mating of individuals that are closely related, such as siblings or cousins. This increases the likelihood of homozygosity, or the presence of two identical alleles, in the offspring. When two individuals are inbred, they share a larger proportion of their genes, which can result in a higher frequency of homozygous genotypes.\n\nHeterozygotes are individuals that have two different alleles for a particular gene. In a population with high levels of inbreeding, the frequency of heterozygotes is reduced because the individuals are more likely to be homozygous for a particular gene. This is because inbreeding increases the likelihood of homozygosity, which reduces genetic diversity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",

            "model_answer": "The common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia consists of a deletion.\n\nExplanation:\n\u03b1-Thalassemia is a group of genetic blood disorders caused by mutations in the \u03b1-globin gene cluster on chromosome 16. The most common type of \u03b1-thalassemia is caused by a deletion of one or more \u03b1-globin genes, resulting in reduced or absent production of \u03b1-globin chains.

A duplication would result in an excess of \u03b1-globin genes, while an insertion would add extra DNA to the gene cluster. A point mutation would change a single nucleotide in the \u03b1-globin gene, but this is not a common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) a deletion.",
