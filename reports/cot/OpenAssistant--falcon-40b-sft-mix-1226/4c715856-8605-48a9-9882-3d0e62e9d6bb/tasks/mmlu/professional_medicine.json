            "question": "A 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis comes to the office for a follow-up examination. The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient with active ankylosing spondylitis would be administration of a drug that inhibits interleukin-1 (IL-1).\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sulfasalazine are commonly used to manage the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, but in this case, they have been ineffective.\n\nCytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that is used to treat certain types of cancer. It works by blocking the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligands, which can enhance the immune response against cancer cells. However, CTLA-4 is not involved in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis, so its inhibition would not be effective in treating this condition.\n\nEpidermal growth factor (EGF) is a growth factor that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and repair. While EGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis, its inhibition would not be the most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient.\n\nTumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a cytokine that is involved in the inflammatory response. Inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1, such as adalimumab and etanercept, are used to treat ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory conditions. However, in this case, the patient has already been treated with sulfasalazine, which is a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, without improvement. Therefore, another TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor is unlikely to be effective.\n\nInterleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory response. Inhibitors of IL-1, such as anakinra and canakinumab, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, administration of a drug that inhibits IL-1 would be the most appropriate next step in treatment for this patient.",
