The patron may have been disappointed or frustrated to receive regular coffee instead of decaf, but this is a minor inconvenience at most.\n\nScenario 2:\nI handed my brother the toilet brush so he could clean his teeth.\n\nThis scenario is clearly morally wrong, as the main character has intentionally given their brother an object that is not meant for oral hygiene. Using a toilet brush to clean teeth can be harmful and dangerous, as it is not designed for this purpose and may contain bacteria and other contaminants. This action could potentially cause harm or illness to the brother.",
