            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The United Kingdom is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe United States has abundant natural resources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and minerals, which make it relatively self-sufficient in the resources needed for modern industry.\n\nJapan has limited natural resources, but it has developed a highly efficient and technologically advanced economy that relies heavily on imports of raw materials and energy. However, it has a strong manufacturing sector and is a major exporter of high-tech products.\n\nFrance has a relatively balanced mix of natural resources and a strong industrial base, making it somewhat self-sufficient in the resources needed for modern industry.\n\nThe United Kingdom, on the other hand, has limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports of raw materials and energy. It has a strong service sector, but its manufacturing sector is relatively small and less developed compared to the other countries. Therefore, the United Kingdom is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process by which a new fashion design is introduced globally is called (A) contagious diffusion.\n\nExplanation:\n\nContagious diffusion is a process in which a new idea, trend, or innovation spreads rapidly and spontaneously from person to person or group to group within a social network. This type of diffusion is often seen in the fashion industry, where a new design or style can quickly become popular and spread across the globe through social media, fashion blogs, and other online platforms.\n\nRelocation diffusion is the process of an innovation spreading from one region to another through migration of people. (B)\n\nInnovative diffusion is the process by which an innovation is adopted by a small number of people or organizations, who then serve as models for others to follow. (C)\n\nHierarchical diffusion is the process by which an innovation is adopted by a small number of people or organizations, who then serve as models for others to follow. (D)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation focuses on the self-reinforcing processes that lead to the development gap between the core and periphery regions. The theory suggests that the initial differences in wealth and development between the core and periphery regions lead to further disparities through a series of interrelated mechanisms.\n\nThe statement (A) suggests that trade can lead to equal distribution of wealth between the core and periphery regions, which contradicts the main idea of Myrdal's theory. Myrdal's theory emphasizes the self-reinforcing processes that lead to the development gap, and trade is not a significant factor in this theory.\n\nTherefore, the statement (A) is not part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) World cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWorld cities are defined as cities that have a significant impact on the global economy, culture, and politics. They are characterized by their ability to attract and retain a large number of transnational corporations, multinational organizations, and other global institutions. These institutions play a crucial role in shaping the global economy and influencing international relations.\n\nOption (A) states that world cities contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations. While it is true that many transnational corporations are headquartered in world cities, this is not a defining characteristic of world cities. World cities can have a mix of local, national, and international businesses, and the presence of transnational corporations is not a necessary condition for a city to be considered a world city.\n\nOption (B) states that world cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities. This is a characteristic of world cities, as they are often hubs for international trade and communication, and are connected to a network of other important cities around the world.\n\nOption (C) states that world cities contain many offices of multinational organizations. While it is true that world cities often host a large number of international organizations, this is not a defining characteristic of world cities. Many cities that are not world cities also have a significant number of international organizations.\n\nOption (D) states that world cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres. This is not true, as world cities can be found in all parts of the world. While some world cities are located in the northern and western hemispheres, there are also world cities in the southern and eastern hemispheres.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The concentration of production activities and people spatially to benefit everyone is called agglomeration.\n\nAgglomeration is the process of clustering production activities and people in a particular area to take advantage of the benefits of proximity. This can include reduced transportation costs, increased access to specialized labor and inputs, and the ability to share infrastructure and services. By clustering together, firms can also benefit from economies of scale and increased competition, which can lead to higher productivity and innovation.\n\nThe substitution principle refers to the idea that a good can be used in place of another good to achieve the same level of satisfaction.\n\nDeglomeration is the opposite of agglomeration, and refers to the process of dispersing production activities and people over a wider area.\n\nInfrastructure refers to the physical and organizational structures that support the functioning of a society, such as roads, bridges, water systems, and power grids. While infrastructure is important for agglomeration, it is not the same as agglomeration itself.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The majority of workers in periphery countries are likely employed in primary activities.\n\nPrimary activities involve the extraction and production of raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, and fishing. These activities are often located in rural areas and are essential for the production of goods and services. In periphery countries, primary activities may be a significant source of employment due to the abundance of natural resources and the availability of low-cost labor.\n\nSecondary activities involve the processing and manufacturing of raw materials into finished products. These activities are often located in urban areas and require a more developed infrastructure and skilled labor. While secondary activities may also be present in periphery countries, they are likely to be less developed than in more advanced economies.\n\nTertiary activities involve the provision of services, such as healthcare, education, finance, and retail. These activities are typically located in urban areas and require a highly developed infrastructure and a skilled workforce. While tertiary activities may be present in periphery countries, they are likely to be less developed than in more advanced economies.\n\nQuaternary activities involve research and development, as well as high-tech industries. These activities are typically located in highly developed economies and require a highly skilled workforce and advanced infrastructure. While some periphery countries may have a small number of quaternary activities, they are unlikely to be a significant source of employment.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the majority of workers in periphery countries are likely to be employed in primary activities.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(A) Southeast\u2014African Americans is incorrect. The Southeast region of the United States is typically associated with states such as Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi, and is known for its warm climate, coastal areas, and Southern culture. While there is a significant African American population in the Southeast, it is not accurate to say that the region is solely associated with African Americans.\n\nThe other options are all correct associations for North American regions.\n\n(B) Oklahoma and the Southwest\u2014Native Americans is correct.
