            "model_answer": "The blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle because the right ventricle is relaxed.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It has four chambers: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles. The left ventricle is responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.\n\nDuring a heartbeat, the left ventricle contracts to push blood out into the aorta and the rest of the body. However, between heartbeats, the left ventricle relaxes and the atria contract to fill the ventricles with blood.\n\nDuring this relaxation phase, the right ventricle is also relaxed, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. This blood then flows into the pulmonary artery and into the lungs to be oxygenated.\n\nTherefore, the blood continues to flow through the vessels between contractions of the left ventricle because the right ventricle is relaxed and allows blood to flow into it from the right atrium.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Graves Disease of the thyroid is a cause of ophthalmoplegia.\n\nExplanation:\n\nGraves Disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, which is an overactive thyroid gland. One of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism is ophthalmoplegia, which is a condition that affects the muscles that control eye movement. This can cause double vision, drooping eyelids, and other eye problems.\n\nOption (A) is correct because it is a cause of ophthalmoplegia.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because Graves Disease does not necessarily cause a large multi-nodular goitre. While it can cause an enlarged thyroid gland, it can also cause a normal-sized or even a small thyroid gland.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because Graves Disease is more common in women than in men.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because 'Derbyshire Neck' is not a term used in modern medicine. It may be referring to a historical condition that was once associated with Graves Disease, but it is not a current medical diagnosis.",

When the nerve stimulus is removed, the muscle fibre relaxes and lengthens again.\n\nOption (A) is correct because it states that the nerve stimulus is removed, which causes the muscle fibre to relax.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because a nerve stimulus that is too forceful would cause the muscle fibre to contract even more, rather than relax.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the actin binding sites are always present in the muscle fibre, whether the muscle fibre is relaxed or contracted.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the actin binding sites can be saturated with myosin during muscle contraction, but this does not cause the muscle fibre to relax. Instead, the muscle fibre relaxes when the nerve stimulus is removed.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise is (C) failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nExplanation:\n\nDuring high intensity exercise, the body's demand for ATP (adenosine triphosphate) increases rapidly, as ATP is the primary energy currency of the body. However, the body's ability to produce ATP through aerobic and anaerobic metabolism may not be able to keep up with the demand, leading to a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. This results in fatigue and a decrease in performance.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a fall in the cell concentration of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. ADP is a byproduct of ATP hydrolysis and its concentration in the cell may increase or decrease depending on the energy demands of the body.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because inhibition of ATP production is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. Inhibition of ATP production can occur due to various factors such as lack of oxygen, accumulation of lactic acid, or depletion of glycogen stores, but these factors are not the primary cause of fatigue.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because lack of skill is not a fundamental cause of fatigue in high intensity exercise. While lack of skill may contribute to increased energy expenditure and decreased performance, it is not the primary cause of fatigue.",

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that are released from neurons and bind to receptors on other neurons, allowing for communication between cells.\n\nAcetyl choline and noradrenaline are two neurotransmitters that have been shown to play a role in fatigue development. Acetyl choline is involved in the regulation of muscle activity, while noradrenaline is involved in the regulation of arousal and attention.\n\nPharmacological agents, such as drugs, can alter the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain, which can in turn influence fatigue development. For example, drugs that increase the levels of acetyl choline or noradrenaline may reduce fatigue, while drugs that decrease their levels may increase fatigue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.",

When we exercise, our muscles require more energy, and one of the ways they obtain this energy is by breaking down glycogen, a stored form of glucose.\n3.

This enzyme breaks down glycogen into glucose, which can then be used as fuel by the muscles.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) insulin.",
