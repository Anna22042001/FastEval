            "question": "Dworkin contends that to every legal question there is only one right answer. Which proposition below is most inconsistent with this claim?\n\n(A) In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\n(B) The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\n(C) Judges exercise strong discretion.\n(D) Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) Judges exercise strong discretion.\n\nExplanation:\n\nDworkin's legal theory, also known as legal positivism, holds that there is a single correct answer to every legal question, which can be discovered through a process of interpretation of the law. This means that judges do not exercise strong discretion in deciding cases, as they are bound by the law and must apply it consistently.\n\nOption (A) is not inconsistent with Dworkin's claim, as it suggests that judges base their decisions on rights, which are an important aspect of the law.\n\nOption (B) is also not inconsistent with Dworkin's claim, as it suggests that the rights of the parties are considered in most cases before the courts.\n\nOption (D) is not inconsistent with Dworkin's claim, as it suggests that judges seek to find the best fit between the case and the law, which is consistent with the idea that there is a single correct answer to every legal question.\n\nTherefore, the most inconsistent option with Dworkin's claim is (C) Judges exercise strong discretion, as it suggests that judges have a significant degree of freedom in deciding cases, which is not consistent with the idea that there is a single correct answer to every legal question.",

It could refer to the likelihood of the offender committing future crimes or the severity of the potential harm they could cause.\n* H: This represents the harm done to the victim or society as a result of the offender's actions.\n\nBased on these components, the formula suggests that the appropriate punishment should be proportional to both the risk posed by the offender and the harm done to the victim or society.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Extent of responsibility multiplied by actual harm done.",

The law as medium is the means through which the law is communicated to the public and is the basis for legal certainty and predictability.\n\n'Law as institution' refers to the way in which the law inhabits the 'lifeworld' and expresses its shared values and norms in institutional form.
