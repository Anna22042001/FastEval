To find the date 24 hours later, we need to find out how long it took her to finish those 40 eggs.\n\nIf we assume she's been eating eggs regularly with no breaks, let's consider two scenarios:\n1. Jane started at 24 hours.\n2. Jane started at less than 24 hours.\n\nIn scenario 1, she'll finish the eggs in the exact 24 hours.\nIn scenario 2, she'll finish the eggs in fewer than 24 hours because she's already eaten each of them.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, let's calculate how many days she took to finish those 40 eggs, and then figure out which option is the one day apart from the given problem statement.\n\nJane buys eggs on May 9th. She finishes them on day (n) - this will be the day she runs out of eggs. Let's assume Jane started eating the eggs (n-1) days after she bought them - meaning on May 10th. (n-1) days x 40 eggs / day = 360 eggs left, which is an impractical number.\n\nThe rest of the eggs will be consumed on May 11th, and the answer will be a day ahead of when Jane's out of eggs.\n\nSo, we can eliminate options A and E.

This means, Jane has 18 days in the month, which falls in June.\n\nStep 2: John thinks today is 6/19/2019, so his calculation is (2019-2019)*(6-1)+(19-1). Since Jane has 18 days, we can subtract 18 from the total number of days in the month to find out the number of days in the month from John's perspective.\n\n        6-19 becomes 13, so 2019-2019 is 0.
