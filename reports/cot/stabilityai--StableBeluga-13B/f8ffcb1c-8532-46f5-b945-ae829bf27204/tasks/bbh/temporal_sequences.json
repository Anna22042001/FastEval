            "model_answer": "To determine the time Sarah could have gone to the art show, we need to find the time between her activities and the art show's closing time.\n\n1. Sarah woke up at 5am.\n2. Kimberly saw Sarah waiting at the airport from 5am to 8am.\n3. Thomas saw Sarah taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 8am to 1pm.\n4. Hannah saw Sarah fixing their computer at the electronic store from 1pm to 2pm.\n5. The art show was closed after 10pm.\n\nNow, we need to find the time between Sarah's last activity and the art show's closing time.\n\nSarah's last activity was fixing their computer at the electronic store from 1pm to 2pm.\nThe art show was closed after 10pm.\n\nTo find the time between these two events, we subtract the end time of her last activity (2pm) from the time the art show closed (10pm).\n\n2pm - 10pm = -8 hours\n\nSince the art show was closed after 10pm, we can't include that time in our calculation. So, we need to find the time between 2pm and 10pm.\n\n2pm - 10pm = -8 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the time between 2pm and 8pm.\n\n2pm - 8pm = -6 hours\n\nSince the art show was closed after 10pm, we can't include that time in our calculation. So, we need to find the time between 2pm and 6pm.\n\n2pm - 6pm = -4 hours\n\nNow, we need to find the time between 2pm and 4pm.\n\n2pm - 4pm = -2 hours\n\nSince the art show was closed after 10pm, we can't include that time in our calculation. So, we need to find the time between 2pm and 2pm.\n\n2pm - 2pm = 0 hours\n\nNow, we have the time between Sarah's last activity and the art show's closing time.\n\n0 hours\n\nSince the art show was closed after 10pm, we can't include that time in our calculation.
