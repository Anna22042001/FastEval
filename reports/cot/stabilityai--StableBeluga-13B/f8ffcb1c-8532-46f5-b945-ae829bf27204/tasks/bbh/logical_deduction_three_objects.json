The falcon is to the right of the blue jay\n2. The blue jay is to the right of the quail\n\nStep 1: Identify where the falcon is\n Because the falcon is to the right of the blue jay, the falcon would be in the 1st position counting from the right. So, the falcon is the second from the right.\n\nStep 2: Identify where the blue jay is\nThe blue jay is to the right of the quail, so it is the object at the 1st position counting from the left. So, the blue jay is the second from the left.\n\nStep 3: Identify where the quail is\nThe quail is to the left of the blue jay, which means it is at the 2nd position counting from the left. So, the quail is the third from the left.\n\nThe answer is:\n(A) The blue jay is the second from the left",
