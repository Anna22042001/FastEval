            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To find the term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making, we will go through each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) Framing bias: This is a type of cognitive bias in which an individual's perception of information can be influenced by the phrasing of a question or the choice of adjectives that describe the information or event. It refers to the way information is presented rather than a 'rule of thumb' type of bias. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\n(B) Hindsight bias: Hindsight bias is the cognitive bias in which people tend to overestimate their ability to have predicted an event after it has occurred. People often think they knew something would happen all along, based on new information learned. This is similar to the 'rule of thumb' type of bias, but it is still not the specific term we are looking for, as it describes certainty rather than decision-making.\n\n(C) Over-confidence bias: Over-confidence bias is the tendency of individuals to significantly overestimate their performance, abilities, or knowledge. As it is similar to the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making and closely related to overconfidence, this option deserves closer consideration.\n\n(D) Heuristics: Heuristics are simple, efficient strategies that help people make decisions rapidly when information is limited or when a complex problem must be solved, without having to carefully consider all alternatives. They are not specifically a 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making, although they do involve quick-thinking in making decisions.\n\nAfter going through each option, we find the term for the 'rule of thumb' type of bias in decision making is:\n\n(C) Over-confidence bias\n\nAnswer: (C)",

She is often credited with transforming the UK economy, privatizing state-owned enterprises and implementing policies that inspired the term 'Thatcherism.'\n\n(B) Mikhail Gorbachov was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985-1991. During his tenure, he pursued policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring), which aimed at transforming the economic and social aspects of Soviet society.\n\n(C) Nelson Mandela was the first black South African president from 1994-1999. His role as a principal leader of the anti-apartheid movement led him to place a strong focus on transforming South Africa's political landscape, emphasizing the need for racial reconciliation, equality, and justice.\n\n(D) Bill Clinton was the 42nd President of the United States from 1993-2001.

It is an assumption about workers' attitudes and motivation in the workplace.\n\nOption A: Workers enjoy responsibility. This does not seem to fit the description, as Theory X is generally seen as a negative assumption about workers. So, this cannot be the correct answer.\n\nOption B: Workers view physical and mental effort as a natural part of work. This statement seems more relevant to Theory X as it implies that workers are inherently resistant towards their work and do not make any effort to improve their performance.\n\nOption C: Workers like to show initiative. Although this may be a desirable characteristic in a workplace, it does not fit the negative assumption of Theory X.\n\nOption D: Workers like to be directed. This statement aligns with the negative assumption of Theory X, which highlights workers' passivity and the need for a command-and-control management style.\n\nThus, the feature of McGregor's Theory X is:\n(D) Workers like to be directed.",

Not directly related to power derived from status or position in an organization.\n(B) Expert: an authority in a specific area, skill, or subject. While an expert may have power due to their expertise, the term \"expert\" is describing a specific skill set and does not directly link to power derived from status or position in an organization.\n(C) Reward: something granted in recognition of service, effort, or achievement. While rewards can be part of power dynamics in an organization, it does not convey the essence of power derived from status or position alone.\n(D) Legitimate: allowed and validated by established rules, legal authority, or public opinion. Based on the definition, the term 'legitimate' implies a power source that is derived from status or position in an organization.\n\nStep 5: Determine the appropriate answer.

Frederick Taylor, an American mechanical engineer, is widely known as the \"Father of Scientific Management.\" However, there is no clear evidence to suggest that this individual was involved in philanthropy initiatives or supporting various philanthropic causes. Therefore, Frederick Taylor is eliminated.\n\n5. Seebohm Rowntree was a British economic liberal, social reformer, and philanthropist. He was known for promoting the welfare-state principles. Seebohm Rowntree is the industrial philanthropist.\n\n6. Henry Ford is a well-known industrialist who successfully utilized his automobile industry empire (The Ford Motor Company) to improve the industries, society, and the lives of millions of people. He was an influential and audacious philanthropist.\n\n7. Max Weber, a German sociologist and philosopher, is best known for his contributions to the social sciences.
