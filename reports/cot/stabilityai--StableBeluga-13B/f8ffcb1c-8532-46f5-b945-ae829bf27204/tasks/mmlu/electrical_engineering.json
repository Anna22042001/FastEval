            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\n\nThe potentiometer method for DC voltage measurement operates on a principle that is based on using aslide wire as a transducer to measure voltage. The slide wire has a high resistance, which means it will generate a small voltage drop when an electric current flow.\n\nHowever, in contrast, a voltmeter directly measures the voltage across a circuit, which produces a reading accurate to a few percent. Compared to potentiometer method, such accuracy can be improved upon by considering the following points:\n\n1. In the potentiometer method, the transducer adds a small load to the circuit, which reduces the system's overall impedance. The reduction in the overall impedance makes the current flow more steadily and resistively, improving the measurement accuracy.\n\n2. In the potentiometer method, the transducer, acting as a voltage divider, divides the system's voltage into smaller components, each being measured accurately by a simple resistor.\n\n3. In the potentiometer method, the transducer uses the resistance of the slide wire to amplify the voltage, making it possible to sense smaller voltage changes accurately.\n\nAnswers comparison:\n\n(A) loading the circuit moderately. This option is correct as it explains that the load placed by the slide wire is less significant than the actual value being measured in the circuit, hence increasing the accuracy of the measurement.\n\n(B) loading the circuit to the maximum extent. Incorrect, as the transducer does not load it to the maximum extent, but rather works as a load that divides the load and measures it with higher accuracy.\n\n(C) using a centre zero galvanometer instead of a voltmeter. This option is incorrect as the resistance used in the transducer is a slide wire and not a galvanometer.\n\n(D) not loading the circuit at all. Incorrect, as the slide wire is actually placed in the circuit as a load to improve measurement accuracy.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

To calculate its amplitude, I will use the period (not provided) and compute its amplitude using:\n\nAmplitude = Source voltage / 2 = 200 V / 2 = 100 V\n\nNow, the rest of the circuit can be analyzed using Ohm's Law for the resistor R:\n\nForce (Voltage) = Current \u00d7 Resistance (Ohm's Law)\n\nCurrent (I) = Force (Voltage) / Resistance (Ohm's Law)\n\nForce (Voltage) = 200 V (Counter emf) - Current (I) \u00d7 Resistance (R)\n\nSolving for Current (I) and substituting:\n\nI = (200 V - R \u00d7 I) / R\n\nPlugging in:\n\nI = (200 V - 100 V) / 100 \u03a9 = 1.0 A\n\nNow, we know that the firing angle is 314 degrees (provided in the problem), so I will subtract this from 360 degrees:\n\nFiring angle in radians = 360\u00b0 - 314\u00b0 = 46\u00b0\n\nConsidering that we know both the counter emf (200 V) and firing angle (46\u00b0 radians), I will convert the latter into degrees:\n\nFiring angle in degrees = 46\u00b0 \u00d7 180 / \u03c0 = 82\u00b0\n\nNow, we can determine the range of firing angle control:\n\nWith the counter emf E = 200 V and the firing angle from the source having a magnitude of 82\u00b0, we need to find the range of values for the counter emf that can be achieved according to the given information.\n\nCounter emf = E' \u00d7 sin(\u03b8 + \u03b8c) + Ec\n\n\u03b8 and \u03b8c are the sinusoidal angles of current and counter emf in radians. This equation becomes:\n\nE' = E \u00d7 sin(\u03b8 + \u03b8c)\n\nFrom this, we solve for the range of firing angles given the condition of having a load counter emf:\n\nE' sin(\u03b8 + \u03b8c) = 200 V (load counter emf)\n\nWe substitute our values:\n\n200 V = E' \u00d7 sin(82\u00b0 + \u03b8c)\n\nNow, we can solve for the range of firing angles (\u03b8c):\n\n\u03b8c = sin-1((E sin \u03b8)/(E' \u00d7 200 V))\n\u03b8c = sin-1((E cos 82\u00b0)/E')\n\u03b8c \u2248 5.0\u00b0\n\nThe required range of firing angle control is determined as the range between the maximum and minimum possible values of firing angle with a load counter emf of 200 V as well as the angles mentioned in the problem:\n\nRange of firing angle control = 82\u00b0 to 82\u00b0 + 5.0\u00b0 = 82\u00b0 to 87\u00b0\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(B) 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",

We know that there are two charged metal plates parallel to the each other, both with equal surface charge densities of the same polarity.\n2. Next, we need to understand the behavior of electric field in such a situation. The electric field due to a single charged metal plate can be calculated using Coulomb's Law.\n3. Now, let's recall Maxwell's Equipotential Theorem. The theorem states that the equipotential surfaces are parallel to the conductor's surface, assuming there is no external electric field. As such, the electric field is uniform in all the directions perpendicular to the conductor's surface.\n4. Finally, when there are multiple charged surfaces, like the two parallel metal plates in this scenario, the net electric field is the resultant of all individual electric fields from each charge.\n\nGiven these steps, we can deduce that:\n\nWhen there are two parallel infinite metal plates with equal and opposite charges, the resulting electric field in the gap between the plates can be considered the same as that produced by a single plate. The net electric field is equivalent to the individual electric fields produced by each plate.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n(A) same as that produced by one plate.",
