            "question": "This is a hierarchy of effects or sequential model used to explain how advertising works:\n\n(A) ADD.\n(B) AIDA.\n(C) PESTLE.\n(D) SWOT.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. To begin, let's briefly break down each term: (A) ADD refers to Advertising's Direct Decision Bond, which focuses on the consumer's reaction to a specific stimulus from the brand. (B) AIDA stands for Awareness-Interest-Desire-Action, which addresses the stages a consumer goes through before taking action such as purchasing. (C) PESTLE represents the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors that may impact a company's success. Lastly, we have (D) SWOT, which is an acronym for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, used for internal analysis of an organization.\n\n2. Now let's evaluate where these models fit in the sequence. Since (A) ADD focuses on the specific reaction of the consumer, it should be the first stage. (C) PESTLE is more of an environmental analysis and is not directly related to consumer reactions. (D) SWOT is the acronym for internal analysis, and it also comes after PESTLE.\n\n3. This leaves (B) AIDA as the model most closely related to (A) ADD in terms of the consumer decision process. AIDA is focused on the stages the consumer goes through before making a decision, so it comes after the consumer's direct interaction with the brand (AD) in the form of advertising.\n\nFinal Answer: (B) AIDA",

            "model_answer": "(A) In the late 1800s.\n\nTo answer this question, we will consider the invention of the first marketing tool and follow its development. \n\nIn the late 18th century, the printing press revolutionized marketing communication by making it possible to disseminate large amounts of information quickly and cheaply. The first printed advertisement dates back to 1704 in the British publication The London Gazette. This invention led to rapid development in marketing methods, tools and techniques.\n\nThe production period of marketing continued to grow throughout the 19th century with advancements in technology, such as the creation of local newspapers, and later national, regional and international publications.\n\nBy the late 1800s, marketing had already become a well-established field, incorporating various techniques such as broadcasting, direct mail, and packaging. This growing prominence led to the development of specialized agencies focusing on marketing communication and branding.\n\nThus, the production period of marketing ended in the late 1800s.
