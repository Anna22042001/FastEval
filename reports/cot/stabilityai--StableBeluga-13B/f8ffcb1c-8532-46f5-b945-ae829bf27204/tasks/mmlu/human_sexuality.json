            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's analyze each theory and see which one uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(A) Sociobiology: Sociobiology is the study of social behavior in animals, including humans. It focuses on the biological and genetic factors that influence social behavior. While it may touch upon human behavior, it does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(B) Psychoanalytic theory: Psychoanalytic theory, developed by Sigmund Freud, focuses on the unconscious mind and the influence of childhood experiences on adult behavior. It does not specifically use terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(C) Script theory: Script theory is a communication theory that focuses on the role of scripts in human interaction. It does not specifically address the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\n(D) Social learning theory: Social learning theory, developed by Albert Bandura, focuses on the learning process through observation, imitation, and modeling. It explains how individuals learn through observing and imitating the behavior of others. This theory uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior.\n\nThe answer is (D) social learning theory.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the most hospitable environment for sperm passage, we need to consider the stages of the menstrual cycle.\n\n1. The menstrual cycle is divided into two main phases: the follicular phase and the luteal phase.\n2. The follicular phase is characterized by the growth and maturation of ovarian follicles, which contain the eggs.\n3. The luteal phase occurs after ovulation and is marked by the secretion of progesterone, which prepares the uterus for potential implantation.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Preovulation: This is the stage before ovulation, when the follicles are maturing but have not yet released an egg. The environment for sperm passage is not optimal at this stage, as there is no egg present for fertilization.\n\n(B) Proliferation: This term is not directly related to the menstrual cycle. It refers to the rapid growth and multiplication of cells or organisms. In the context of the menstrual cycle, it does not provide any information about the environment for sperm passage.\n\n(C) Ovulation: This is the stage when the mature egg is released from the ovary, making it the most hospitable environment for sperm passage. The egg is now available for fertilization, and the cervical mucus becomes more favorable for sperm survival and movement.\n\n(D) Menstruation: This is the stage when the uterine lining is shed, and the menstrual bleeding occurs. The environment for sperm passage is not optimal during menstruation, as the uterus is not receptive to sperm and the cervical mucus is unfavorable for sperm survival and movement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most hospitable environment for sperm passage is during (C) ovulation.",

Determine which part of the male reproductive system is most likely to be affected by these STDs.\n\nGonorrhea and chlamydia are both STDs that can affect the male reproductive system. They are most commonly transmitted through sexual contact.\n\nThe male reproductive system consists of the penis, scrotum, urethra, and bladder.\n\nNow, let's analyze each part of the male reproductive system:\n\n(A) Penis: The penis is the external organ of the male reproductive system and is not directly involved in the transmission of STDs.\n(B) Scrotum: The scrotum is the sac that contains the testes and is not directly involved in the transmission of STDs.\n(C) Urethra: The urethra is the tube that connects the bladder to the penis and is used for both urination and ejaculation. It is a common site for STDs to infect.\n(D) Bladder: The bladder is a storage organ for urine and is not directly involved in the transmission of STDs.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely part of the male reproductive system to be infected by gonorrhea and chlamydia is the:\n\n(C) urethra",
