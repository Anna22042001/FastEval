Michael Sandel is a political philosopher who argues against the idea of moral engineering, which is the attempt to use technology and science to engineer moral behavior.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the given options.\n(A) Kantian approach: This refers to the ethical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which emphasizes the importance of rationality, autonomy, and the categorical imperative.\n(B) Ethics of prima facie duty: This refers to the ethical theory that focuses on the prima facie duties, which are the duties that seem to be true in a given situation, but may be overridden by other duties.\n(C) Virtue ethics approach: This refers to the ethical theory that focuses on the development of virtues, such as courage, honesty, and compassion, as the foundation for moral behavior.\n(D) Natural law theory approach: This refers to the ethical theory that emphasizes the existence of natural laws that govern human behavior and moral decision-making.\n\nStep 2: Determine which approach best fits Sandel's case against moral engineering.\nSandel's case against moral engineering is based on the idea that moral behavior should not be engineered through technology and science. This suggests that he believes in the importance of human autonomy and the ability to make moral decisions based on individual values and principles.\n\nStep 3: Match the approach to the given options.\n(A) Kantian approach: While Kant's ethics emphasize rationality and autonomy, it does not directly address the issue of moral engineering.\n(B) Ethics of prima facie duty: This approach focuses on the prima facie duties, which may be overridden by other duties. It does not address the issue of moral engineering.\n(C) Virtue ethics approach: This approach focuses on the development of virtues, which may not directly address the issue of moral engineering.\n(D) Natural law theory approach: This approach emphasizes the existence of natural laws that govern human behavior and moral decision-making. It does not directly address the issue of moral engineering.\n\nStep 4: Determine the best-fitting approach.\nNone of the given options directly address the issue of moral engineering. However, the natural law theory approach comes closest to addressing the issue, as it emphasizes the existence of natural laws that govern human behavior and moral decision-making.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer.\n(D) a natural law theory approach.",
