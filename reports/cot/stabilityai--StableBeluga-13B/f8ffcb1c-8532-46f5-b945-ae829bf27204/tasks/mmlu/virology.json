            "model_answer": "Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is most often used for:\n\n(B) To search for drug resistant mutants\n\nReasoning:\n\nNGS is a powerful tool for analyzing DNA and RNA sequences. It allows for the rapid and accurate sequencing of large amounts of genetic material. This makes it an ideal method for studying the genetic makeup of organisms, including viruses and bacteria.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because NGS is not specifically designed to identify newly discovered viruses. While it can be used for this purpose, it is not the most common application.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because quasi species viruses are not a well-defined concept in virology. NGS can be used to study viral diversity, but it is not specifically designed for identifying quasi species viruses.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because NGS is a widely used and valuable tool in various fields of biology and medicine.",

            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for (A) Placebo effect.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Randomization is the process of assigning participants to different groups or treatments in a study.\n2. In a clinical trial, randomization helps to ensure that the groups are similar in terms of important characteristics, such as age, gender, and medical history.\n3. The placebo effect is the phenomenon where a participant's belief in a treatment or intervention leads to a perceived improvement in their condition, even if the treatment is ineffective or a placebo.\n4. By randomizing participants, the researchers can minimize the influence of the placebo effect on the results of the study.\n5. This is because the placebo effect is more likely to affect participants who are similar in terms of their beliefs and expectations, and randomization helps to ensure that these factors are evenly distributed across the different groups.\n6. Therefore, randomization is most helpful for controlling for the placebo effect.",
