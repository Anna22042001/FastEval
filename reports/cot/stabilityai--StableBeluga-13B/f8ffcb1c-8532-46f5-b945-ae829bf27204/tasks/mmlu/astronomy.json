How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",

            "model_answer": "To determine how the two stars will appear to your eyes, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. The angular separation of the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes.\n2. The angular resolution of your eyes is the smallest angle at which you can distinguish two separate objects.\n3. If the angular separation is smaller than the angular resolution, it means that the two objects cannot be distinguished as separate objects.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.",

This is in contrast to other types of luminosity, which are typically limited to specific wavelength ranges or portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. By integrating the luminosity over all wavelengths, astronomers can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the object's energy output.",
