            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "s First, let's break this down and understand the concept.\n\nInitially, we are given two pieces of information:\n1. Actual brightness of the object: This is the actual amount of light emitted by the object.\n2. Apparent brightness from our location: This is the brightness that we observe or perceive from the object's position relative to us.\n\nNow, we know that when objects move, they change in apparent brightness. This is because their emitted light crosses the air and scatters due to the movement, making their apparent brightness change. This is known as the Doppler effect.\n\nSo, considering the given information and the relationship between apparent brightness and object speed, we can estimate:\n\n(A) The object's speed relative to us.\n\nAs we are not given any other information about the object's composition, size, or distance from us, we cannot estimate these values. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is:\n\n(A) Its speed relative to you",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.\n\nThe sky looks blue due to Rayleigh scattering. The Earth's atmosphere contains various particles that scatter sunlight. These particles are smaller than the wavelengths of visible light (like blue light), so as light enters the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths get scattered more than the red wavelengths, which allows blue light to travel further than the other visible colors. This blue light accumulates, creating the blue color we see in the sky during the daylight hours.",

            "model_answer": "To better understand this question, let's explain each statement in detail. \n\nStatement A: The first time you drop a bowling ball and it falls to the ground proving your hypothesis. \n(A) If you dropped a bowling ball and it fell to the ground, this only confirms the presence of gravitation between two objects, not an attractive force between all objects. Gravity is a class of interaction between objects. \n\nStatement B: After you\u2019ve repeated your experiment many times.\n(B) While repeating an experiment multiple times can help build a stronger argument in favor of your theory, it does not necessarily guarantee that your theory is correct. Repeating experiments might just provide more statistically significant evidence, but it does not prove your theory to be correct. \n\nStatement C: You can never prove your theory to be correct only \u201cyet to be proven wrong\u201d.\n(C) This statement is false. While it can be difficult or even impossible to prove something with absolute certainty, scientific theories can be confirmed to a high degree of probability through evidence and consistent observations. So, it is possible and even likely that your theory can be proven to be correct through evidence. \n\nStatement D: When you and many others have tested the hypothesis.\n(D) This statement is the closest to a correct answer. Collaboration with others can lead to a significantly more robust and accurate evaluation of your hypothesis, leading to greater confidence in your theory. Moreover, widespread testing and replication of experiments can both confirm and refine the results, helping prove or disprove your theory.\n\nSince the answer seems to be (D), let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n(D) When you and many others have tested the hypothesis.",
