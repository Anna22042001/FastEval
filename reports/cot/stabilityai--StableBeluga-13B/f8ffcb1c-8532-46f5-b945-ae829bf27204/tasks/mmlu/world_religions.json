It focuses on the balance of opposing forces like yin and yang.\n\n(B) Yin-Yang School: This is a school of thought originating from Daoism. It emphasizes the continuity of change which is present in the natural world.\n\n(C) Mengzi: Mengzi is also known as Mencius.

Search for Babylonian festivals and their descriptions related to the key terms.\n3. Match the description of the festival to the options provided.\n\nBabylon, an ancient city-state in modern-day Iraq, had a unique New Year's festival called Akitu. This festival lasted 12 days and consisted of a series of rites, processions, and rituals aimed at celebrating the city's culture and traditions.\n\nOption A describes the New Year's festival as \"ten day,\" which is incorrect. We actually have a \"twelve day\" festival. Thus, answer A is incorrect.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not familiar names of Babylonian festivals meaning there might not be any festivals that have aspects of the key terms \"ten days,\" \"New Year,\" and \"Babylonian culture.\" Thus, options B, C, and D are also incorrect.\n\nBased on our research, the answer must be a festival celebrating Babylon's culture during the New Year, and lasting for 10 days. None of the options mentioned that and hence, none of the options fit the description of the festival.\n\nSo, our answer is:\n(E) - None of the above",

            "model_answer": "The question is asking for a term used by Guru Nanak to denote the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. To find the answer, I will look into Guru Nanak's teachings and his terms.\n\nStep 1: Research into Guru Nanak's teachings\nI have found that Guru Nanak (the first Guru of Sikhism) taught about the importance of devotion to God and the unity of all faiths. One of the key practices of Sikhism is the recitation of the Anand Sahib, a collection of hymns in Punjabi. \n\nStep 2: Analyzing the answer choices\nNow I will refer to the given answer choices and try to identify which one aligns best with Guru Nanak's teachings.\n\nAnswer A: Shabad\n\nIn Sikhism, Shabad (also spelled as Shabda) refers to \"Divine Word\" or \"Divine Sound\". This term resonates with Guru Nanak's teachings about the importance of devotion to God and the divine revelation expressed through the Anand Sahib hymns.\n\nAnswer B: Khalse\n\nThe term \"Khalse\" does not seem to be related to Sikh theology or terminology.\n\nAnswer C: Nam\n\n\"Nam\" is a term often used in the Sikh community to refer to \"name\" or \"name of god\". However, in this context, it does not denote \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation.\n\nAnswer D: Guru\n\nGuru (meaning \"Teacher\" or \"Master\") is an important title for the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak himself, however, it does not specifically refer to \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation within his teachings.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is:\n\n(A) Shabad",

He also spoke directly to God and received revelations.\n\nB) Muhammad's migration to Medina: It is also known as the Hijrah or the migration. However, this event took place after the Mi'raj, so this is not the correct answer.\n\nC) Muhammad's first community in Mecca: This is not referencing an event directly associated with Muhammad, but rather the formation of the first community in Mecca, which took place earlier in his life.\n\nD) Muhammad's revelations of the Qur'an: Although the Qur'an contains many events related to Muhammad, including his journey to heaven in the Mi'raj, it refers to revelations that Muhammad received over a period of time.

However, it doesn't cite a specific dharmashastra that dates from around the first century.\n\n(B) Laws of Karma - Although the concept of Karma is well-known in Hinduism, this option appears to be about the laws of Karma rather than the titular dharmashastra specifically. It's too general to be the most famous.\n\n(C) Laws of Vishnu - This option's relevance can be valid since Vishnu is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, but it doesn't specify a particular dharmashastra written by him or about him.\n\n(D) Laws of Manu - This is the most likely option as the Manu Smriti, a dharmashastra that dates back to as early as the first century AD, is often referenced and considered one of the most famous ones. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) Laws of Manu",
