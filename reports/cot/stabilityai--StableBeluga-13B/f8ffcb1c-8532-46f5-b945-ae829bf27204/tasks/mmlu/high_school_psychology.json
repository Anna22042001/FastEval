Personality assessments typically focus on an individual's traits, preferences, and patterns of behavior, but they do not specifically address the relationship between an individual's environment and behavior.\n3. Cognitive assessments focus on an individual's cognitive abilities, such as intelligence, memory, and problem-solving skills, but they do not address the relationship between an individual's environment and behavior.\n4. Ecological assessments, on the other hand, attempt to identify the most pressing behavioral problem and possible ways to alleviate it by investigating the relationship between aspects of an individual's environment and behavior.\n5.
