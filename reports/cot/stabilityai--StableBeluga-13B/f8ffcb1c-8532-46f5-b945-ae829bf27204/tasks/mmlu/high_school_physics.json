The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\n\nStep 3: Determine which statements are true\n\nAt the highest point, the ball's speed is zero due to gravity pulling it down. This is true for statement I.\n\nAt the highest point, the ball's acceleration is not zero due to gravity pulling it down. This is true for statement II.\n\nThe ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down because it has to overcome gravity and air resistance on the way up.
