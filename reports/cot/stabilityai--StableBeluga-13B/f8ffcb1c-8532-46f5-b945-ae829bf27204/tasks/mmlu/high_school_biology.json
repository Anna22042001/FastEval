Artificial selection: This is the process of selectively breeding cattle to produce desired traits. It involves choosing the best individuals for breeding based on specific traits, such as meat quality, size, or milk production.\n\n2. Directional selection: This is the process of selecting individuals with traits that are increasing in frequency over time. This can lead to an increase in the average trait value in a population.\n\n3.
