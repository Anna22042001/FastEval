When an object of any mass or volume displaces a fluid, it tends to displace an amount of fluid proportional to its weight or its volume.\n\n3.

To induce voltage in the wire loop, the magnetic field acting on the loop must change.\n3. In the wire loop, there are two factors that can cause changes in the magnetic field:\n        (a) The movement of electrons creates an electric field, which in turn generates a perpendicular magnetic field due to Faraday's law. This creates a net resultant magnetic field.\n        (b) A changing magnetic field induces voltage (Faraday's Law of Induction) in a wire loop that experiences an electric field at right angles to the magnetic field.\n\n4. From the given options, only options (A) and (C) mention the changes in the magnetic field\n      (C) \"is at right angles to the electric field\" does not apply, since the question does not mention the angle of the electric field to the magnetic field in this context.\n\n5.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A step-up transformer in an electric circuit can step up:\n\n(A) voltage\n\nExplanation: Step-up transformers are designed to increase the voltage in an electric circuit. This is done by increasing the number of turns on the primary coil and decreasing the number of turns on the secondary coil.\n\nThe voltage in an electric circuit is the potential difference that encourages electric current to flow through a conductor. It is expressed in voltage units or volts (V). As the voltage increases, the potential energy of the charges that make up the current also increases, and this translate to a higher amount of work that can be done by the electric current.\n\nBy stepping up the voltage, more energy is available for use in the circuit. Although the energy associated with the electric circuit does increase, the term \"energy\" is a little broader than just voltage. Therefore, we can only say that the transformer is increasing voltage, but not necessarily energy.\n\nAn good example of a step-up transformer is the one used in a power plant to increase the voltage of the electricity generated before is sent to the power lines. This allows the electricity to travel farther and more efficiently as it moves through the power grid towards consumers.\n\nAnswer:\n(A)",
