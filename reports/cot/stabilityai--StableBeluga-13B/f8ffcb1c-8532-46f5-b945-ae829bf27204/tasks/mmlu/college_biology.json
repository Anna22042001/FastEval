This results in a decrease in the rate of the reaction. The inhibitor does not irreversibly modify the enzyme or form covalent bonds with it. Instead, it competes with the substrate for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site. This competition effectively reduces the enzyme's activity and the rate of the reaction.",
