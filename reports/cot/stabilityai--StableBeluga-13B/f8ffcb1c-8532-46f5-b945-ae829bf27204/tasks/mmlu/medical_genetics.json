This is because genome-wide association studies have identified a limited number of SNPs that contribute to the variation in body mass index. However, the heritability of body mass index from twin and family studies suggests that a larger proportion of the variation is due to genetic factors.",

It is calculated as the probability of inheriting two copies of the same allele from a common ancestor.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the effects of an increase in F\nAn increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, means that individuals in a population are more likely to be related to each other.

The presence of introns is not directly related to inbreeding, so this option is not affected by an increase in F.\n(D) Higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: This option is not directly related to inbreeding, so it is not affected by an increase in F.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\nThe answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand what \u03b1-thalassaemia is and what the common mutation in it is.\n\n\u03b1-thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It is caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making the beta globin chain of hemoglobin.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) a deletion: A deletion is the loss of one or more nucleotides from a DNA sequence. In the context of \u03b1-thalassaemia, a deletion in the HBB gene would result in a non-functional or reduced production of the beta globin chain, leading to the disorder.\n\n(B) a duplication: A duplication is the addition of one or more nucleotides to a DNA sequence. In the context of \u03b1-thalassaemia, a duplication in the HBB gene would result in an excess of the beta globin chain, which could lead to a different disorder called beta-thalassaemia.\n\n(C) an insertion: An insertion is the addition of one or more nucleotides to a DNA sequence. In the context of \u03b1-thalassaemia, an insertion in the HBB gene would likely disrupt the normal functioning of the gene, leading to the disorder.\n\n(D) a point mutation: A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence. In the context of \u03b1-thalassaemia, a point mutation in the HBB gene could potentially lead to the disorder, but it is less common than the other mutations mentioned.\n\nBased on this analysis, the common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is:\n\n(A) a deletion.",
