The frequency of the echo is f'', where f'' = f' - \u0394f.\n\nWe know that the frequency of the siren in the rest frame of the police car is f = 600 Hz. The frequency of the siren observed by the wall is f' = f + \u0394f.\n\nWe also know that the speed of sound is c = 350 m/s. The speed of the police car is v = 3.5 m/s.\n\nNow, let's find the Doppler shift \u0394f.\n\n\u0394f = (f' - f) = (f + \u0394f - f) = 2\u0394f\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\n2\u0394f = (f + \u0394f) - f\n\n2\u0394f = f + \u0394f - f\n\n2\u0394f = \u0394f\n\n\u0394f = f\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for the sound wave to reach the wall:\n\nt = v/c = 3.5 m/s / 350 m/s = 0.01 s\n\nThe time it takes for the echo to return to the police car is 2t = 0.02 s.\n\nThe distance the police car moves during this time is vt = 3.5 m/s * 0.02 s = 0.07 m.\n\nNow, let's find the frequency of the echo:\n\nf'' = f' - \u0394f = (f + \u0394f) - \u0394f = (600 Hz + 600 Hz) - 600 Hz = 1200 Hz - 600 Hz = 600 Hz\n\nThe frequency of the echo is f'', which is closest to 600 Hz.\n\nAnswer: (C) 600 Hz",
