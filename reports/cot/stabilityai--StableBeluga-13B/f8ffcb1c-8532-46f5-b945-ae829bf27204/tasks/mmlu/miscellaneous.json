            "model_answer": "To find the answer, we need to consider the number of households in the United States and the average number of movies watched per household in a year.\n\nStep 1: Find the number of households in the United States\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, there were approximately 128,870,000 households in the United States in 2020.\n\nStep 2: Find the average number of movies watched per household in a year\nAccording to a study by Nielsen, the average American watches 3 hours and 40 minutes of TV per day. Assuming that 1 hour of TV equals 1 movie, this means that the average American watches 1.75 movies per day.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year\nTo find the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we can multiply the number of households by the average number of movies watched per household in a year.\n\nTotal movies watched = Number of households * Average number of movies watched per household in a year\nTotal movies watched = 128,870,000 * 1.75\nTotal movies watched = 222,007,500\n\nNow, we can compare this number to the given options.\n\n(A) 200,000,000 is too low.\n(B) 2,000,000,000 is too high.\n(C) 20,000,000,000 is too high.\n(D) 200,000,000,000 is too high.\n\nThe closest option is (B) 2,000,000,000, but it is still too high.\n\nAnswer: (A) 200,000,000",

Calculate the energy required to melt the ice.\n3. Determine the number of drinks consumed in the United States each year.\n4. Calculate the total energy wasted by throwing out unused ice.\n\nStep 1: Average amount of ice used in a drink\nThe average amount of ice used in a drink is approximately 100 grams.\n\nStep 2: Energy required to melt the ice\nThe specific heat capacity of ice is 2.09 J/g. To melt 100 grams of ice, we need to multiply the specific heat capacity by the mass of ice:\n\n2.09 J/g * 100 g = 209 J\n\nStep 3: Number of drinks consumed in the United States each year\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average American consumes 2.2 liters of soda per day. Assuming that the average soda contains 100 grams of ice, we can calculate the total number of drinks consumed in the United States each year:\n\n2.2 liters/day * 365 days/year * 0.100 kg/drink = 78.5 million drinks/day\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total energy wasted by throwing out unused ice\nNow, we can calculate the total energy wasted by throwing out unused ice:\n\n78.5 million drinks/day * 209 J/drink = 16.2 billion J/day\n\nTo convert this to energy per year, we can multiply by the number of days in a year:\n\n16.2 billion J/day * 365 days/year = 6.01 * 10^11 J\n\nAnswer: (B) 6*10^11 J",
