            "model_answer": "When considering an important source of information on the credit rating of retail businesses, there are several aspects to consider:\n\n1. The Retail Merchants Association (A): While it may provide useful information, it typically represents the interests of its members and focuses more on advocacy and industry developments, rather than collecting and sharing retail credit ratings.\n\n2. The local chamber of commerce (B): While this may provide some insights into the business environment and financial standing of local businesses, it typically focuses on supporting local business growth and community development, rather than facilitating the evaluation of retail credit ratings.\n\n3. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. (C): This company specializes in collecting financial and business information on companies. It provides credit reports and ratings to its clients that can help them evaluate potential risks and credit issues associated with a business. Dun & Bradstreet is a trusted authority in the financial industry.\n\n4. The United States Retail Credit Association (D): This organization may be involved in the retail industry, but its primary focus is on promoting fair and healthy credit practices within the industry. While it may provide some insight into retail credit, it does not collect and distribute credit rating information.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\nAnswer: (C) Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Determine the melting point of paper in degrees Fahrenheit. (Though paper can combust, it is more important to find its melting point.)\n\nStep 2: According to various sources, paper's melting point is around 450 to 460 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nStep 3: To find the approximate combustion temperature, take into account that paper combustion usually takes place much higher than its melting point.\n\nStep 4: Since paper is not likely to burn at or below its melting point, and we need to find an approximate temperature, we will take 10% higher than the melting point.\n\nStep 5: Multiply the 450-460 degrees Fahrenheit by 1.10 (10%). The formula appears to be: Temperature \u2248 Melting Temperature * (1 + 0.1 Melting Temperature).\n\nTemperature \u2248 450 * (1 + 0.1 * 450)\nTemperature \u2248 450 * (1.45)\nTemperature \u2248 672.5 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nStep 6: Since 672 degrees Fahrenheit does not match any of the given temperature options, let's round it to the nearest multiple of 10 degrees:\n\n672 \u00f7 10 = 67.2\n- 0.2\n67 degrees Fahrenheit\n\nAnswer: (B) 2125 degrees",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "In order to find the material that has a resistance least affected by temperature changes, we need to analyze their properties.\n\n(A) Copper is a metal, and its resistivity decreases as the temperature increases due to its low temperature coefficient. This is because higher temperatures cause the lattice vibrations and the free conduction electrons to increase, leading to more collisions, scattering, and less resistance.\n\n(B) Carbon is a non-metal, and its resistivity highly depends on the presence of impurities. Even if the reference to pure carbon is made, it is still a poor conductor and may not accurately represent pure materials. Moreover, pure carbon materials have no significant thermal resistance influence.\n\n(C) Germanium is a semiconductor material, and its resistance does not change significantly with temperature. However, this material has a lower resistivity at high temperatures than metals and ceramics, which can cause a small change in resistance with temperature.\n\n(D) Silicon is also a semiconductor material, and its resistance does not change significantly with temperature, which is similar to Germanium. The resistivity of Silicon usually doesn't change much with temperature, so this material's resistance is somewhat stable against temperature changes compared to Metals and Carbon.\n\nGiven the information provided, the material that has a resistance that is LEAST affected by temperature changes is (A) Copper.",
