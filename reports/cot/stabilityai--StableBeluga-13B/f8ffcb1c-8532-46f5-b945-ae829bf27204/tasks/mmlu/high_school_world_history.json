This aligns with the goals of non-aligned movement aiming for peace and supporting developing countries' independence.\n\nB) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation: The passage emphasizes the importance of peace and preserving independence. This does not directly address disarmament or non-proliferation, but it does relate to the issues as they are means of maintaining peace.\n\nC) The Green Revolution in agriculture: The passage focuses on world peace and mobilizing Asian and African countries' strength. The Green Revolution is a radical change in agriculture practices and technology unrelated to the theme of the passage.\n\nD) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology: This term refers to the alignment and joining of Asian nations under a common ideology.

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
