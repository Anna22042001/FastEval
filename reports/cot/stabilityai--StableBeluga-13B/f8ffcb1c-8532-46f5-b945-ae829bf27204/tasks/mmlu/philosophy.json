It is not directly related to psychological egoism, which is a philosophical concept.\n(B) Controlled studies are experiments designed to test a hypothesis. They are not directly related to psychological egoism, which is a philosophical concept.\n(C) Interviews and surveys are methods of gathering information from people. They can be used to support psychological egoism, but they are not the basis of most arguments for it.\n(D) Nonempirical means not based on observation or experience. Psychological egoism is a philosophical concept, so it is not nonempirical in character.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer\nThe correct answer is (C) because interviews and surveys can be used to support psychological egoism, but they are not the basis of most arguments for it.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand Cicero's views on immorality and expediency. Cicero was a Roman philosopher and statesman who lived from 106 BC to 43 BC. He believed that the ultimate goal of human life was to achieve virtue and happiness.\n\nStep 1: Understand Cicero's views on immorality.\nCicero believed that immorality was repugnant to Nature. This means that immorality goes against the natural order of things and is not in line with the virtues that humans should strive for.\n\nStep 2: Understand Cicero's views on expediency.\nCicero believed that expediency was in accord with Nature. This means that expediency is in line with the natural order of things and helps humans achieve their ultimate goal of virtue and happiness.\n\nStep 3: Compare Cicero's views on immorality and expediency.\nSince immorality is repugnant to Nature, and expediency is in accord with Nature, we can conclude that Cicero's views on immorality and expediency are:\n\n(B) repugnant to Nature; in accord with Nature.\n\nAnswer: (B) repugnant to Nature; in accord with Nature.",

Synthetic: A statement is synthetic if it is true or false based on experience.\n\nNow, let's analyze Kant's view on morality.\n\nKant believed that morality is based on reason and that moral laws are a priori, meaning they are true independently of experience. He argued that moral laws are not derived from experience, but rather they are the basis for experience.\n\nBased on this analysis, the supreme principle of morality according to Kant is:\n\n(A) analytic and a priori.",

Descartes was a philosopher who is famous for his method of doubt, which he used to question the foundations of knowledge and establish a firm basis for his beliefs.\n\nIn his work \"Meditations on First Philosophy,\" Descartes presents the idea of an evil demon as a possible explanation for the deception of his senses and the possibility that his beliefs might be false.

This makes it impossible for them to determine the consequences of their actions on others, as they do not know their own position. As a result, they would not be able to accurately assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of utilitarianism, which prioritizes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\n(B) doing so would be too risky.\n\nThis is not the main reason Rawls argues against utilitarianism.
