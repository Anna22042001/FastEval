            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost can be determined by analyzing various factors related to cost and revenue. \n\nStep 1: Understand the concept of marginal revenue and marginal cost\nMarginal revenue is the change in total revenue when the quantity sold changes by one unit. Marginal cost, on the other hand, is the change in total cost when the quantity sold changes by one unit. It is the additional cost that a company incurs due to producing and selling an additional unit.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options\nOption A: While total revenue is indeed greater than total cost at some point, this situation does not relate to the equality between marginal revenue and marginal cost, as the difference in total revenue and total cost is not due to changes in quantity sold.\n\nOption B: This situation is correct, as total revenue and total cost both refer to the change in revenue and cost due to changes in quantity, respectively. When the quantity goes up by 1 unit, the revenue increases due to more sales, and the cost also increases due to more production. In this state, where total revenue and total cost are equalized, the marginal cost and revenue are also equalized.\n\nOption C: This situation is not correct because marginal product refers to the change in total product when the quantity produced changes by one unit. Since the marginal revenue, marginal cost, and marginal product can be different, finding their equality in this scenario is not possible.\n\nOption D: Total product refers to the total quantity produced, which does not have a direct relation with the equality between marginal revenue and marginal cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\n(B) total revenue is equal to total cost\n\nAnswer: B",

            "model_answer": "To determine which course of action the firm should take, we need to analyze each option according to the goal of maximizing the total product. Notice that total product is equal to the product of labor times the product of capital. Let the amount of labor be \"x\" and the amount of capital be \"y\":\n\nTotal product = (x * 200) + (y * 50)\n\nWe're trying to find the optimal point for labor (x) and capital (y) where:\n\n1. The total product reaches its maximum value;\n2. The marginal product of each factor also reaches its maximum value.\n\nOption (A) suggests increasing the amount of capital and decreasing the amount of labor, which should lead to the marginal product of labor rising while the marginal product of capital falls. According to the assumptions, the firm faces the opposite problem: marginal product of labor is already high, while the marginal product of capital is lower. Therefore, option (A) is not the desired course of action.\n\nOption (B) is contradictory to option (A). In fact, the two options suggest that one should increase and decrease capital and labor, respectively, which would break the assumptions made about marginal productivity levels. Therefore, option (B) is not an appropriate course of action.\n\nOption (C) suggests decreasing the amount of capital and increasing the amount of labor, which should lead to the marginal product of capital rising while the marginal product of labor falls. In this case, the firm should not decrease its capital, as marginal product of capital is already low. Again, this is not an appropriate course of action.\n\nOption (D) is the same as option (A) in terms of changing the amount of capital and labor. Since option (A) was already ruled out based on the assumptions, option (D) is also not the desired course of action.\n\nThe only possible option after analyzing the given conditions and the suggested course of action is:\n\n(A) Increase capital and decrease labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nHowever, since this option was ruled out as not suitable, option (D) is the closest remaining option. In this situation, the firm should:\n\n(D) Decrease capital and increase labor so that the marginal product of capital falls and the marginal product of labor rises.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

This greatly benefits the firms involved in the collusion. As a consequence, collusive output levels increase and push the price of goods and services above their competitive levels.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "I'll explain my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The situation given is that the \"rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase.\"\n2. When a similar pricing strategy is executed, the demand for a product is largely affected by competitive rivalry.\n3. In a long-term perspective, firms trying to maintain or increase their respective market share might choose to follow a price decrease, leaving out a price increase.\n4. As a result, the oligopolist in this situation needs to focus on balancing their pricing strategy with their competitors' behavior, which also involves observing their capabilities and price reactions.\n\nNow, considering these points, let's analyze each of the given answers and determine which one represents the demand curve that matches the scenario:\n\n(A) Perfectly horizontal demand curve\n- A demand curve that is entirely horizontal represents a demand that does not change regardless of the changes in price. In this given situation, a horizontal demand curve would be inappropriate when dealing with competitors who consider a price decrease reaction, as the demand curve does not respond to price changes.\n\n(B) Highly inelastic demand curve\n- A highly inelastic demand curve is characterized by the slight change in demand in response to changes in price. This might be relevant when competitors react to price changes by either matching or decreasing prices which would lead to a more stable demand curve, suitable for the scenario described.\n\n(C) Highly elastic demand curve\n- A highly elastic demand curve is the opposite of the inelastic demand, characterized by a greater change in demand as the price changes. This would not be suitable for the scenario as the demand is constrained within a limited range when firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase.\n\n(D) A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments\n- Although the given situation seems somewhat similar, it is not entirely accurate representation due to the limited information given. We would need more context to determine if this curve represents the demand curve facing the oligopolist in this case.\n\nBased on this analysis, it is clear that among the given options, (B) Highly inelastic demand curve best represents the demand curve facing an oligopolist when rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase.

            "model_answer": "First, let's examine each basis individually:\n\n(A) Higher risk job: Wage differentials are often based on risk since employers tend to pay more if the job involves higher risk. This is due to the statistic that workers in high-risk jobs are more likely to get injured or killed on the job or have to take time off for injury recovery.\n\n(B) Investment in human capital: A significant factor in wage differentials is the human capital of an individual. Highly skilled workers tend to command higher salaries due to their valuable skills, knowledge, and experience. Investments in education, certifications, or on-the-job training can also lead to higher wages.\n\n(C) Increase in production of SUVs: While it might seem like an external factor related to pay, there is not an inherent correlation between the production of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and wage differentials. \n\n(D) Racial discrimination: Wage differentials can also be the result of disparities due to racial discrimination in the workplace.
