            "model_answer": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n1. Contagious diffusion (A): This type of diffusion occurs when a new idea or trend spreads rapidly from one person to another, often through social networks or word of mouth.\n2. Relocation diffusion (B): This type of diffusion occurs when people move from one place to another, taking their ideas and customs with them.\n3. Innovative diffusion (C): This type of diffusion occurs when a new idea or trend is introduced by an innovator or early adopter, and then spreads to others through imitation or adoption.\n4. Hierarchical diffusion (D): This type of diffusion occurs when a new idea or trend is introduced by a leader or authority figure, and then spreads through the hierarchy of society.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given information: \"When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as...\"\n\nFashion designs are often introduced by innovators or early adopters, and then spread through imitation or adoption. This process is similar to innovative diffusion (C).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) innovative diffusion",

The substitution principle (A) is about replacing one factor with another to achieve a desired outcome, which is not related to the spatial concentration of production activities and people.\n4. Deglomeration (B) is the opposite of agglomeration, which means dispersing activities and people, not concentrating them.\n5. Infrastructure (D) is about the physical components needed for an economy to function, but it does not describe the spatial concentration of production activities and people.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining option:\n\n6.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the meaning of the terms \"periphery countries\" and the types of activities they are likely to be involved in.\n\n1. Periphery countries: These are countries that are located on the outskirts or edges of a larger economic or political region. They are often less developed and have lower levels of economic activity compared to the core countries within the region.\n\n2. Types of activities: The three main types of economic activities are primary, secondary, and tertiary.\n\n   (A) Primary activities: These are activities that involve extracting or harvesting natural resources, such as agriculture, fishing, and mining.\n   (B) Secondary activities: These are activities that involve processing or manufacturing raw materials, such as construction, manufacturing, and textiles.\n   (C) Tertiary activities: These are activities that involve providing services to the population, such as retail, transportation, and healthcare.\n   (D) Quaternary activities: These are activities that involve high-level services, such as research and development, finance, and information technology.\n\nNow, let's analyze which type of activities is most likely to be employed by workers in periphery countries.\n\nPeriphery countries are often less developed and have lower levels of economic activity compared to core countries. This means that they are more likely to be involved in primary and secondary activities, as these are the most basic and essential economic activities.\n\nTertiary activities are more advanced and require higher levels of development, which are typically found in core countries. Quaternary activities are even more advanced and require even higher levels of development, which are even less likely to be found in periphery countries.\n\nBased on this analysis, the majority of workers in periphery countries are most likely employed in primary and secondary activities.\n\nAnswer: (B) Secondary",
