(1, 1),\n2. (1, 2),\n3. (1, 3),\n4. (1, 4),\n5. (1, 5),\n6. (1, 6).\n\nWe will have one 6 in the first rool and then either a 1 or a 2 in the second roll. Our total number of ways to get a 6 in the first 2 rolls is 6 * 2 = 12.\n\nNow, calculate the number of ways we can roll a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls (maximum of 2 rolls with 1 6).\n\n1. We do not get a 6 in any of the 5 rolls.\n2. Get a 6 in the first roll and do not get a 6 in the other 4 rolls.\n3. Get a 6 in the first roll and a 6 in the second roll.\n4. Get a 6 in the first and third rolls.\n5. Get a 6 in the first and fourth rolls.\n6. Get a 6 in the first and fifth rolls.\n\nOur total number of ways to get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is 4 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24.\n\nSo, the probability that we get a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = 12 / 24\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives us:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = 3 / 8\n\nYou can simplify this to the formula for the average success probability. Since we have 5 rolls, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to get:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = (3 / 8) * (5) = 3\n\nNow we convert this to a percentage and change the sign of the expression.\n\nP(at most 2 6) = 3 * 100% = 300%\n\nHowever, 300% is not a valid probability, since probability is always between 0% and 100%. So we divide by 100%:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = 300% / 1% = 300\n\nFinally, multiplying by the total number of possible outcomes, we get:\n\nP(at most 2 6) * 6^5 = 300 * 6^5\n\nThe cube of 6 is 216, and the 5 instances of 6 cancel out, giving us:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = (300 * 6^5) / (216^5) = 300 / 216 = 1.389\n\nHowever, we need this result in a fraction form. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 gives:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = (1.389 * 2) / 2 = 1.778\n\nNow we need to find the closest possibility in (A) through (D). The closest is (B), which is 1/324 rather than 1.778, which gives us:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = (1.778 * 648) / (216^5) = (1.778 * 648) / (216^5) = 1778\n\nHowever, this is not a probability, so we simplify it to a fraction:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = (1778 * 648) / (216^5) = 1778 / (216^5) = 1778 / 216 = 8\n\nThe fraction can be simplified to:\n\nP(at most 2 6) = 8 / 25 = 8\n\nNow we have the answer.
