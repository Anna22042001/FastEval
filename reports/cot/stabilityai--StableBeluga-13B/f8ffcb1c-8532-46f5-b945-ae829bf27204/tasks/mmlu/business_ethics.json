            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question\n- We are given three factors associated with cryptocurrencies and three factors associated with charitable giving.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each factor\n- Factor associated with cryptocurrencies:\n  - Bitcoin becoming mainstream (expensive)\n  - Requires computing power and electricity to obtain and maintain (expensive)\n  - Highly in demand (expensive)\n- Factor associated with financial crime:\n  - Making it easier to transfer funds anonymously (unsecure regarding privacy)\n  - Anonymity has been used to launder money and commit fraud (useful in criminal activity)\n- Factor associated with charitable giving:\n  - Often distributed to those in need (secure)\n  - Contributes to the welfare and betterment (secure)\n  - Uses a transparent and accessible system (secure)\n\nStep 3: Match the factors\n- The factors associated with cryptocurrencies are expensive, secure, and involved in financial crime.\n- The factors associated with charitable giving are expensive, secure, and beneficial.\n\nStep 4: Pick the closest match\n- Both sets of factors have security issues, and one set has secure factors, which would make them insecure. Since the secure factors are a closer match, the options are:\n  - Traditional currency, Cheap, Unsecure, Charitable giving (option B)\n  - Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial crime (option C)\n\nStep 5: Choose the best answer by selecting the answer that gives a better truthful representation of facts\n- Both options seem to be a close match for the secure factor, but option C (Secure, Financial crime) seems to be more explicit and representative of the facts and ethical implications of cryptocurrencies as a more complete picture.\n\nAnswer: (C) Cryptocurrencies, Cheap, Secure, Financial Crime",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the concepts of Corporate Profit Maximization and Normative Theories.\n\nCorporate profit-maximization is a principle based on the pursuit of maximizing shareholder wealth and profit. This ideology often emphasizes financial gain for stakeholders. Normative theories are derived from philosophical perspectives that explain how people should act and what morals should guide their actions.\n\nStep 2: Compare the characteristics of Corporate Profit Maximization to those of the given normative theories.\n\n(A) Hedonistic Utilitarianism: This theory advocates for maximizing overall pleasure and minimizing pain which are measured by individual hedons, ignoring distribution. This theory does not focus on maximizing profit but rather personal pleasure and happiness.\n\n(B) Preference Utilitarianism: Similar to Hedonistic Utilitarianism, this theory focuses on individual preference. However, preference utilitarianism calculates the moral value of each act based on how closely it aligns with people's subjective preferences. Like hedonistic utilitarianism, it does not directly maximize profits.\n\n(C) The Categorical Imperative: Developed by Immanuel Kant, this theory focuses on a principle that categorically commands humans to act morally. This theory emphasizes the importance of treating people and nature with dignity and respect. The focus is on following Kant's rules and not solely aiming for financial gain.\n\n(D) Ethics of Care: This perspectives emphasizes \"caring relationships,\" such that individuals must take into account the interests and well-being of the vulnerable and marginalized groups. Ethics of care could argue that corporate profit-maximization that leads to harm or devalues certain human beings can be unethical.\n\nStep 3: Determine which normative theory is most similar to corporate profit-maximization.\n\nAfter analyzing the concepts of corporate profit-maximization and the given normative theories, it is clear that the ethics of care is the theory that is most similar to corporate profit-maximization in its focus on looking out for the interests and well-being of the vulnerable and marginalized groups. This theory is concerned not only with maximizing profit but also with balancing competing interests of various stakeholders. Ethics of care asserts that businesses should balance profit with ethical considerations and the impact on society.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer.\n\nSo, the normative theory most similar to corporate profit-maximization is:\n\n(D) ethics of care",
