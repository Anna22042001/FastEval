            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand what a buffer overflow attack is and then identify the first instance of such an attack.\n\nA buffer overflow attack is a type of security exploit that occurs when a program or process tries to store more data in a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it was intended to hold. When this happens, the extra data can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially causing the program to crash or execute unauthorized code.\n\nNow, let's go through the options step-by-step:\n\n(A) Love Bug: The Love Bug, also known as the ILOVEYOU virus, was a computer worm that spread through email attachments. It was not a buffer overflow attack, but rather a malicious software that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook to spread itself.\n\n(B) SQL Slammer: SQL Slammer was a worm that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server. It was not a buffer overflow attack, but rather a denial-of-service attack that exploited a buffer overrun vulnerability.\n\n(C) Morris Worm: The Morris Worm was the first Internet worm, which spread through vulnerabilities in the Usenet newsgroup system. It was not a buffer overflow attack, but rather a self-replicating program that exploited security flaws in the Unix operating system.\n\n(D) Code Red: Code Red was a worm that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS web servers. It was not a buffer overflow attack, but rather a denial-of-service attack that exploited a buffer overrun vulnerability.\n\nBased on the information provided, the first buffer overflow attack was not mentioned in the given options. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(E) None of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "(A) True, True\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. In the OKWS design, the web server (okd) needs to establish a TCP connection with the client web browser. This requires file descriptor passing to allow the web server to listen on a specific port and accept incoming connections. Without file descriptor passing, the web server would not be able to establish a TCP connection with the client web browser.\n\n2. The OKWS design requires okd to run as a non-root user. This is necessary for security reasons, as running as root would grant the web server full access to the system. However, without file descriptor passing, it would be impossible for okd to inherit file descriptors from the parent process, which would prevent it from running as a non-root user.\n\nAnswer: (A) True, True",

A buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it can hold.\n2. This causes the data to spill over into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting important data or code.\n3. In the context of a buffer overflow attack, the attacker's goal is to overwrite a specific location in memory, such as the return address or the instruction pointer register.\n4. When the return address is overwritten, the program will jump to the attacker-injected code instead of returning to its original location.\n5. When the instruction pointer register is overwritten, the program will start executing the attacker-injected code instead of its original instructions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) By overwriting the return address to point to the location of that code: This is the correct answer. Overwriting the return address allows the program to jump to the attacker-injected code.\n\n(B) By writing directly to the instruction pointer register the address of the code: This is incorrect because the instruction pointer register is already overwritten, not written to directly.\n\n(C) By writing directly to %eax the address of the code: This is incorrect because %eax is a register, not a memory location where the attacker-injected code is stored.\n\n(D) By changing the name of the running executable, stored on the stack: This is incorrect because the name of the running executable is not stored on the stack.\n\nThe answer is (A).",
