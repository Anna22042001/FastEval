This leads to a high bias and high variance.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to the model. The regularization term penalizes the weights, which means the model will try to find a balance between fitting the data and avoiding overfitting. This results in a trade-off between bias and variance.\n\nAs we increase the regularization coefficient, the model will try to reduce the impact of the weights on the predictions. This will lead to a decrease in the variance of the model, as it will be less likely to overfit the data. However, this decrease in variance will also lead to an increase in the bias of the model, as it will be less likely to capture the true underlying relationship between the features and the target variable.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(A) Bias increase ; Variance decrease",
