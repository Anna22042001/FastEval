Calculate the interest rate on the borrowed amount:\n   $200,000 borrowed for one year at 10% interest rate = $20,000 interest cost.\n\n2. Calculate the interest rate on the compensating balance:\n   $200,000 * 15% compensating balance = $30,000 interest cost.\n\n3. Calculate the effective annual interest cost:\n   $20,000 + $30,000 = $50,000 interest cost.\n\nNow, we need to find the effective annual interest rate. To do this, we can use the formula:\n\nEffective Annual Interest Rate = (1 + Interest Rate) ^ (Number of Periods) - 1\n\nIn this case, the number of periods is 1 year, and the interest rate is 10%.\n\nEffective Annual Interest Rate = (1 + 0.1) ^ 1 - 1 = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1\n\nNow, we can find the effective annual interest cost by multiplying the effective annual interest rate by the borrowed amount:\n\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = 0.1 * $200,000 = $20,000\n\nThe answer is closest to:\n\n(A) 11.5 percent.",
