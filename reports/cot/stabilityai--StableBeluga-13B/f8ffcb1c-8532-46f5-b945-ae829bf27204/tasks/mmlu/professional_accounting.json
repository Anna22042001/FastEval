            "question": "Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end. However the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory. What effect did the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise have on Arno's balance sheet at year end? Assets Liabilities\n\n(A) No effect No effect\n(B) No effect Understated\n(C) Understated No effect\n(D) Understated Understated",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the importance of recording expenses\nRecording expenses, including the purchase of merchandise, is crucial for accurately representing a company's financial position. It aids in calculating profit or loss and ensures that the company meets all its obligations by ousting the money needed for debt repayment, taxes, etc. To analyze the situation, we need to imagine a situation.\n\nStep 2: Imagine the situation\nLet's imagine that Arno Co. has not included an expense of $10,000 (10 units \u00d7 $1,000 each) in its accounts. To reconcile this difference, we will consider only the effects on Arno's balance sheet as of the year-end (the end of the last financial year).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the situation\nFirst, we need to see the comprehensive effect of the omitted expense on the Balance Sheet. Afterwards, we would decide how it affects the two Balance Sheet categories: Assets and Liabilities.\n\nBalance Sheet = Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity\n\nStep 4: Calculate the equity\nThe omitted $10,000 expense for merchandise correctly appears in the year-end physical inventory. Thus, Arno Co.'s Total Equity remains the same.\n\nStep 5: Analyze Liabilities\nSince neither the expense nor the related merchandise appears in Income Statements, on which the company would've recorded the sales they made over the year, additional Income Taxes might not be paid. In this case, the omitted expense wrongly influences the company's overall accounting records.\n\nStep 6: Analyze Assets\nGiven that the company does not record the purchase of merchandise, the Assets section of the balance sheet will be understated by $10,000.\n\nStep 7: Choose the correct answer\nNow, we are aware of the effect of the omitted expense on Balance Sheet components. However, we must still determine which Balance Sheet category is affected more, i.e., Assets or Liabilities.\n\nIf we consider both components' relative importance, Liabilities should be less affected since no additional payment is needed. We are dealing with accounting aspects since we are talking about recorded expenses rather than real outflows.\n\nThus, despite Arno Co. not being required to record the expense in its accounting records, the effect on its balance sheet categories, Assets and Liabilities, would be imbalanced. This results in an Understated (amount calculated earlier) Assets and a No effect (this is the best we could do since the real impact is also understated) Liabilities.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: \n\n(D) Understated Understated",

It will generate profits of $500 each in years 5 and 10.\n3. The discount rate is 10%.\n\nThe net present value (NPV) is the present value of all future cash flows, minus the initial investment, and we want to calculate it in our case.  We do this step by step:\n\n1. Future profits in year 5: $500 (profit) * 1.10 (discount rate) = $550\n2. Future profits in year 10: $500 (profit) * 1.10 (discount rate) * 1.10 (discount rate) = $550 (because revenues after 5 years are discounted twice)\n3. We add the present value of both year 5 and year 10 profits: $550 + $550 = $1100 future cash flows\n4. We subtract the initial investment: $1100 (future cash flows) - $500 (initial investment) = $600 net present value (NPV)\n\nSo the NPV turns out to be $600.\n\nThe final answer is as follows:\n\n(A) \u2212$3",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the implications of using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium on the bond.\n\nStep 1: What is the straight-line method and the effective interest method?\nThe straight-line method assumes equal bond interest over the life of the bond instead of inputting the exact date the bond will be paid. The effective interest method takes into account the yield curve and pays interest accurately based on when cash flows will occur.\n\nStep 2: How was the error made?\nDean Co. used the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium, which has led to an understatement of interest expense and an overstatement of the bond carrying amount and retained earnings.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the effects on each balance sheet item.\n\n- Bond carrying amount: When the straight-line method is used, the bond carrying amount will be overstated during the early years of the amortization period and then gradually lowered to the correct amount as time goes on.\n\n- Retained earnings: Using the straight-line method, the interest expense follows the bond carrying amount, which means an understatement of interest expense will lead to an overstatement of retained earnings.\n\nStep 4: Check if the error has any effect on earnings per share.\nSince the error was in the amortization of premium, there is no change to the number of shares outstanding. Therefore, the error has no effect on earnings per share.\n\nNow, answer the question in one line based on the analysis.\n\n(B) Understated overstated",
