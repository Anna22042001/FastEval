Huxley introduces the term \"Protoplasm\" (the scientific name for the substance of which he is speaking) by explaining that it is the \"physical basis of life.\"\n2. Huxley claims that many people might find the idea of a physical basis for life to be novel, suggesting that the belief that life works through matter is widespread.\n3. He states that the matter of life, which works through death and its products (carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds), possesses no properties but those of ordinary matter.\n\nFrom these points, Huxley believed that life was:\n\n(A) a force that works through matter (this option implies that life can function separately from matter, which contradicts the provided information)\n(B) essentially a philosophical notion (this is not supported by the evidence)\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter (this option is closest to Huxley's view, as he argues that life is related to certain materials)\n\nThus, Huxley argued that life is:\n\n(C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter\n\nAnswer: (C)",
