            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion based on 2020 medical knowledge, we need to consider factors such as:\n\n1. Patient age: Infants and children tend to require smaller cannulas, while adults require larger ones.\n2. Patient weight: A larger cannula might be required for obese patients compared to those who are normal weight.\n3. Vein diameter: Adequate vein size to accommodate the cannula is essential for blood flow and safety.\n4. Venipuncture site: Some sites, such as the scalp and hand, may require thicker cannulas.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age and weight of the patient:\n\n- A child under 3 years old typically weighs around 20-25 kg, requiring a smaller cannula.\n- Adults weigh around 60-80 kg, needing a larger cannula.\n\nNext, let's consider the vein diameter:\n\n- Large veins in the arms can accommodate cannulas as large as 22 gauge.\n- Veins in smaller venipuncture sites may require a smaller cannula to avoid vein damage.\n\nNow we can determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion based on these factors:\n\n- An 18 gauge cannula might be too large in a small child.\n- A 20 gauge cannula might be adequate for an adult, but might be too small for a 3-year-old.\n- A 22 gauge cannula is likely the most appropriate size for an adult, with 18 or 20-gauge for smaller patients depending on their age, size, and vein site.\n- A 24 gauge cannula is potentially too small to handle a rapid blood transfusion in most cases (unless for a neonate).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(A) 18 gauge.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, let's analyze each option:\n\n1. (A) strength: While strength is required to propel oneself forward, it is not specific to marathon running. Strength is present in many other forms of physical activity.\n\n2. (B) power: Power is the ability to exert force quickly. In some athletic events, power is a critical factor, like in sprinting or weightlifting. However, in a long-distance event like a marathon, power is not the primary factor.\n\n3. (C) stride length: Stride length refers to the distance covered by a foot between successive steps. A longer stride length may lead to increased economy of motion, reduced energy expenditure, and a more efficient running style for marathon runners, but it is just one component of a successful marathon performance.\n\n4. (D) stamina: Stamina is the ability to sustain physical or mental energy for a long period of time. In a marathon, stamina is crucial, as runners have to maintain a consistent pace for hours. It plays a significant role in achieving a successful marathon performance.\n\nConsidering the importance of sustaining energy for extended periods and how this is essential in long-distance running, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\nAnswer: (D) stamina.",

Its symptoms include:\n\n1. Swelling of the lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema).\n2. Difficulty in breathing (dyspnea) or shortness of breath.\n3. Low blood pressure (hypotension).\n4. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.\n5. Shock (hypotension, dyspnea, and loss of consciousness).\n6. Gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, cramping, diarrhea).\n7. Hives (urticaria) or skin redness.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given symptoms and see which one is NOT a part of anaphylaxis.\n\n(A) Stridor: This is a high-pitched, continuous, and usually stertorous sound made during breathing. It can be due to a narrowing of the airway and is a symptom of respiratory distress, which is not specific to anaphylaxis.\n\n(B) Bradycardia: This is a slow heart rate, below 60 beats per minute. While it is true that bradycardia can occur due to certain medications used in anaphylaxis treatment, it is not a direct symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\n(C) Severe wheeze: This is whistling or coarse squeaking noise, produced during breathing. It is not specific to anaphylaxis and usually occurs due to respiratory problems.\n\n(D) Rash: Sometimes a rash may occur following anaphylaxis, but this is not the first or most common symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nAfter analyzing the four listed symptoms, the symptom that is NOT a part of anaphylaxis is:\n\nThe answer is: (D) Rash.",

Therefore, this situation is not related to the use of closed pouches.\n\nB) Colostomy - A colostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the colon, allowing for waste to be collected and expelled in a controlled manner.

            "model_answer": "I will now explain my reasoning step-by-step for the question.\n\nQuestion: With an increasing number of sprints, what happens to the body?\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Anaerobic contribution progressively increases: During sprints, the body's main source of energy is anaerobic glycolysis. As the number of sprints increase, the anaerobic contribution does become more significant.\n\n(B) pH of the muscle falls below 6.0: During exercise, lactic acid is produced as a byproduct of glycolysis. This leads to an acidic environment, so the pH of the muscle could fall slightly below normal. However, low pH is not a specific consequence of an increasing number of sprints.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L: The body may indeed exhaust its stores of blood glucose during strenuous exercise; however, this is a general characteristic of sustained exertion, not specific to the number of sprints.\n\n(D) Relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases: Resting between sprints allows the body to tap into its aerobic energy system. With increased sprints, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism is expected to rise as the body better adapts to using more oxygen.\n\nNow the answer: (D) relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",

One such effect is the increase in the blood bicarbonate concentration, which serves as a source for bicarbonate ions that can react with hydrogen ions (H+) produced during muscle contraction, neutralizing their effect and reducing their buildup in the muscle cells.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Fatty acids are long chain hydrocarbons with various carbon atoms joined together by single or double bonds. They serve as nutrients for the body.\n\n2. Mitochondria are organelles within the cell called as the powerhouse of the cell. The primary function of these organelles is to generate energy for the cell by converting nutrients into ATP (Adenosine triphosphate).\n\n3. A common example of a fatty acid metabolism pathway is called the beta-oxidation cycle. \n\nNow, let's consider each option and try to match it with the process:\n\nA. Thiokinase does not play any role in fatty acid metabolism.\n\nB. Coenzyme A (CoA) is produced by the combination of pantothenic acid and phosphate groups (a process called CoA biosynthesis). Coenzyme A participates in the synthesis of fatty acids, fatty acid oxidation, and several other cellular processes.\n\nC. Acetyl-CoA is a derivative of CoA which is an essential carrier molecule for numerous metabolic processes in the body, including glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation.\n\nD. Carnitine is involved in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria. Carnitine acyltransferase, an enzyme, catalyzes the transfer of acyl groups (fatty acids) from acyl-CoA molecules to carnitine molecules. This carnitine needs to be activated by the action of the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT). This activated carnitine then transports the fatty acids into the mitochondria for further metabolism.\n\nConsidering the above, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Carnitine.",
