For example, if we have two rings, R and S, homomorphism f: R \u2192 S is a function, where elements of R are mapped to elements of the ring S. If the function f is one-to-one, it means that for every element x in R, there is a unique element y in S such that f(x) = y. In other words, for the stated function f: R \u2192 S, for every element x in R, there is exactly one element y in S where f(x) = y; i.e., there are no two elements in R whose images are the same.\n\nThe kernel of a homomorphism is the set of all x in R such that for any y in R, there is an element in S with f(x) = f(y). In other words, the kernel is the subset of elements that get mapped to the same element in S.\n\nStatement 2:\nA is an ideal in R.\n\nAn ideal in a ring (R) is a sub-ring, a subset that is closed under addition and multiplication. In essence, an ideal is a set of elements in R that includes R+1, where (R+1) is the largest idempotent from R. For an ideal to exist, two conditions must hold: For every a, b in R+1, (a * b) is also in R+1 and additionally, for every a, b in R (or R+1), a - b is also in R+1.\n\nSo, each statement is stating something distinct about the given topic. We need to examine their truth values separately.\n\nStatement 1: In this statement, we are given a unique relationship between a ring homomorphism and the kernel of the homomorphism. The statement indicates that for a homomorphism to be one-to-one, necessarily, its kernel must be {0}. \n\nStatement 2: The statement indicates that for a sub-ring to be an ideal, it must obey specific rules regarding multiplication and addition.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate each statement regarding their truth value.\n\nStatement 1: For a given function f from a ring R to another ring S, if it is a one-to-one homomorphism, the kernel of the homomorphism will be {0}.\n\nStatement 2: A subset of elements in a ring is an ideal if and only if it satisfies the criteria stated in the statement.\n\nSince Statement 1 states that the kernel of a one-to-one homomorphism will be {0} and Statement 2 does not make any claim about the kernel of the homomorphism, we can now compare the truth values of both statements.\n\nComparison:\nStatement 1 (True) and Statement 2 (True)\n\nThe truth value for both statement 1 and statement 2 is true, so the answer is:\n\n(A) True, True\n\nAnd the solution is:\n(A) True, True",
