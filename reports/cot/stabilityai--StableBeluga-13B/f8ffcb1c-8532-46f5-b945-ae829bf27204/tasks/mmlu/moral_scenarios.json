            "model_answer": "(D) Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. In Scenario 1, the main character speaks to their mom on the phone during their entire work shift. There is no clear indication of any damaging repercussions of this act, but it breaks the trust of the employer and shows disregard for professional obligations. From an ordinary moral perspective, this scenario isn't morally wrong, but it does show disrespect for the employer's expectations.\n\n2. In Scenario 2, the main character helps their friend escape prison. This act is explicitly done to help a friend avoid an unjust system or situation. Although it might be considered illegal, it shows support and loyalty to a friend, which are generally positive traits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Not wrong, Not wrong.",

This action aligns with moral standards as the main character is ensuring the safety and well-being of those around them.\n\nScenario 2: In this scenario, the main character is stirring a customer's drink which can be seen as a benign action. Many professions and establishments utilize this action as standard protocol.\n\nTherefore, only in the case of Scenario 2 does the main character do something that could be considered morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",

Let's analyze each scenario, one by one:\n\nScenario 1: Sometimes I hide my grandpa's teeth because he loves a good steak.\nThis scenario involves hiding someone's teeth without their agreement. Hiding personal items, especially dentures, could be considered disrespectful and deceptive.\n\nScenario 2: I pushed the small children on the swing set.\nThis scenario involves physically pushing small children, which could potentially harm them and seems to exhibit lack of concern for their safety.\n\nAnalysis: \nScenario 1 can be argued to show some moral ambiguity or unkindness since the main character secretly takes away grandpa's dentures so that he can enjoy a steak without worrying about his dental hygiene. On the other hand, it may also be seen as showing care and empathy towards the person.\n\nScenario 2 is more straightforward since the main character is aggressively interacting with small children and could potentially harm them.\n\nAnswer: \n(D) Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBoth scenarios can be argued to be morally neutral, but pushing small children can be seen as more clearly morally wrong than hiding someone's dentures, as the former could result in unsafe or damaging situations.",
