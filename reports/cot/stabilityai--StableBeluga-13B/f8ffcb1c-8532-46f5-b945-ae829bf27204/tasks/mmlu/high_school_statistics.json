In this case, it would be the value that separates the higher-paid administrators from the moderately-paid teachers. Since the teachers want more money, they would likely focus on the median to argue that the district is paying too little to the teachers compared to the administrators. The mean, mode, and standard deviation may not be as relevant to their argument, as they do not directly address the issue of fairness in salaries between teachers and administrators.",
