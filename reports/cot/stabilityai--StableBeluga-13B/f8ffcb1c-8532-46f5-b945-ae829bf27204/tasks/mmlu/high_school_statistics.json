            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the test statistic\nThe test statistic is the sample mean, here it is computed as (x-\u03bc)/\u03c3, x being the observed weights, \u03bc (mu) representing the mean weight of the aspirin tablets, and \u03c3 representing the standard deviation, which we don't have. Instead, we have a mean weight of 300 mg, so the test statistic is (wtmean-300)/0 (since we dont have the standard deviation available)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistics\nFor the first sample mean, the weights are: 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, and 301. The mean weight for this sample is 301 mg. When we compare it to the given mean of 300 mg, the mean weight is 1 mg higher than the claim.\n\nFor the second sample mean, the weights are: 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303. The mean weight for this sample is 302 mg. When we compare it to the given mean of 300 mg, the mean weight is 2 mg higher than the claim.\n\nStep 3: Find the t values\nt 1.54 with 6 df is calculated as P(t>1.54)/sqrt(7) = 3.165, which corresponds to a probability of 0.0392.\nt 1.54 with 7 df is calculated as P(t>1.54)/sqrt(8) = 3.359, which corresponds to a probability of 0.0336.\n\nStep 4: Compare the p-values\nThe p-values for both tests are lower than the one given in the question. We need to find which of the p-values is closest to that of the question.\n\nThe p-value in option A is 3.165, which is closer to the given one (0.0392) and is lower than the p-value in option B (3.359).\n\nAnswer: (A) P(t > 1.54) with df = 6",

Analyze the given hypothesis. The null hypothesis is, in fact, false.\n2. Consider the significance level of 0.05.\n3. The researchers modify the experiment to use twice as many experimental units for each treatment.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the provided options and their relationship to the experiment:\n\n(A) - The probability of a Type I error and the probability of a Type II error would both decrease.\nThis is incorrect. If the null hypothesis is false and the significance level is 0.05, then increasing the sample size and modifying the experiment does not decrease the probabilities of a Type I or Type II error. Instead, it increases these probabilities (by dividing the total sample size by the square root of the experimental units).\n\n(B) - The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.\nThis is also incorrect. Increasing the experimental units will always increase the likelihood of detecting a significant result if there is one. However, it may not change the power analysis.\n\n(C) - The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.\nCorrect. This choice directly addresses the modification of the experiment. By increasing the sample size, the experimental units, the probability of a Type II error gets lower (the larger sample size helps reduce the chances of a Type II error). The power, too, increases since there is a higher likelihood of detecting a significant effect if one exists.\n\n(D) - The probability of a Type I error would stay the same and the power would increase.\nThis is incorrect. Increasing the experimental units will increase the power, as stated in option C. It will also increase the Type I error probability (by dividing the total sample size by the square root of the experimental units).\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(C) The probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase.",
