Check if all integers in the set satisfy the \"only if\" part: If the set contains every integer greater than 1, and a few smaller than 1, then the \"only if\" part would be met.\n   \n   To check this, let's examine all the sets:\n\n(A) {(-6, -2, -1, 1, 2, 6)}: Contains (6), therefore does not satisfy the 'only if' part.\n\n(B) {(-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6)}: Contains (6), but (0) is repeated. This violates the 'only if' part as 0 is not a divisor of itself.

Disk Seek Time: This time remains the same as there is only one seek operation per block.\n2. Disk Latency Time: Approximately the same for both versions as it involves the read-write head movement and the time it takes to access data on the disk.\n3. Disk Transfer Time: With a block size of 4,000 bytes, the transfer time is reduced to 1 msec per 2,500 bytes due to the higher amount of data being transferred simultaneously.\n4. Operating System Overhead: Since it is 1 msec per 1,000 bytes, the overhead remains the same in both versions. However, the size of the block being read has also increased to 4,000 bytes, so there is more data being read in the operating system, which results in an additional overhead of 10 msec.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total time for each version.\nSince both components of time remain the same for version 1 and version 2, the only change is the extent of the operating system overhead time due to the larger block size.\n\nComparing version 1 and version 2:\n  - Operating System Overhead: 1 msec + 1 msec (block of 1,000 bytes) + 10 msec (block of 4,000 bytes) = 12 msec (total o/s overhead)\n\nComparing version 1 and version 2:\n  - Operating System Overhead: 1 msec + 1 msec (block of 1,000 bytes) + 10 msec (block of 4,000 bytes) = 12 msec (total o/s overhead)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the ratio of total time for each version.\nTotal Time Ratios:\n - Version 1:   1000 bytes/0.0129 seconds = 7812.18\n - Version 2: 4000 bytes/0.0129 seconds = 3113.49\n\nThe ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1 is approximately:\n\n(B) 1:3.5\n\nSo, the answer is (B).",
