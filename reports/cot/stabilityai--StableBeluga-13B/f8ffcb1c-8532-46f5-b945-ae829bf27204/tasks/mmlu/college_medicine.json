These bases pair up in a specific way: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) variable: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines (A and G) to pyrimidines (T and C) is always 1:1 in a double-stranded molecule of DNA.\n\n(B) determined by the base sequence in RNA: This option is incorrect because the base sequence in RNA is determined by the base sequence in DNA, not the other way around.\n\n(C) genetically determined: This option is incorrect because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is a characteristic of the DNA molecule itself, not something that is genetically determined.\n\n(D) always 1:1: This option is correct because the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in a double-stranded molecule of DNA is always 1:1.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n(D) always 1:1",
