            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. The program is for those with 6 or fewer months to live.\n2. It aims to keep them at home.\n3. It provides pain relief.\n4. It ends all life-prolonging technologies.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) Euthanasia: Euthanasia is the act of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. While it may involve pain relief, it is not focused on keeping the person at home or ending life-prolonging technologies.\n\n(B) Cryonics: Cryonics is the process of preserving a human body or brain at very low temperatures in the hope of reviving them in the future. It is not related to providing care for those with a short life expectancy.\n\n(C) Medicare: Medicare is a health insurance program in the United States for people aged 65 and older, as well as some younger people with disabilities. It is not focused on providing care for those with a short life expectancy.\n\n(D) Hospice: Hospice is a type of care for people with a life expectancy of six months or less. It focuses on providing comfort and support to the patient and their family, rather than actively prolonging life.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Hospice",
