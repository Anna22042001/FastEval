It is the total value of goods and services produced within a country during a specific period.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the components of GDP\nGDP = C (Consumption) + I (Investment) + G (Government Spending) + (Exports - Imports)\n\nStep 4: Determine the effect of the purchase on each component\n- C (Consumption): The purchase of the painting is a consumption expenditure, so it will increase C.\n- I (Investment): The purchase of the painting is an investment in the company's assets, so it will increase I.\n- G (Government Spending): The purchase of the painting is not related to government spending, so it will not affect G.\n- (Exports - Imports): The purchase of the painting is not related to exports or imports, so it will not affect this component.\n\nStep 5: Determine the overall effect on GDP\nSince the purchase of the painting increases both C and I, the overall effect on GDP will be an increase.\n\nAnswer: (B) GDP increases by the amount of the purchase because I increases.",

This, in turn, reduces private investment and consumption, as individuals and businesses shift their resources to the government bonds.\n\nOption (A) is the correct answer because it describes the situation where decreasing interest rates occur due to contractionary fiscal policy.
