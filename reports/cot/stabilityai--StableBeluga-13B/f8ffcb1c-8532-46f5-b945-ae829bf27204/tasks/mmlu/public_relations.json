            "question": "You are the vice president of public relations for a corporation that produces a well-known brand of food products. In the Albany, New York, market, one of your products has recently been found to have some contamination. While apparently not fatal, it has given a large number of consumers severe stomach cramps and other intestinal problems. The cause has been traced back to your product, which is sold throughout the nation. Your CEO wants to know what you would advise to keep the situation from becoming a public relations disaster. What should you recommend?\n\n(A) Quickly investigate to make certain your product is definitely the cause of the illness.\n(B) Stop all sales of the product throughout the nation and issue a recall for that product.\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n(D) Issue a press release to the Albany, New York, market explaining how to treat the symptoms.",

            "model_answer": "Recommendation:\n(C) Stop sales of the product in the Albany, New York, market and issue a recall for that product.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Determine the immediate priority and scope of action. The contamination was found in Albany, New York, and it is important to focus initial responses on that market.\n\n2. Investigate the issue: It's important to quickly find out if the product is definitively the cause of the illness before proceeding with broader actions.\n\n3. Decide on course of action based on investigation: If the product is proven to be the cause of the illness in Albany, then it should be halted in sales there.\n\n4. Issue a recall: If the product truly is causing the illness, issuing a recall is vital to minimize the impact on the public's health and the corporation's reputation.\n\n5. Avoid a widespread recall: It's not necessary to issue an immediate, nationwide recall, since it has only affected Albany, New York.\n\n6. Address safety concerns: Recalls can make consumers worried about other products or brands, so it's important to assure them that the contaminated product is the only one affected and that steps are being taken to resolve the issue.\n\n7. Consider alternatives to a complete product recall: If the cause can be identified and removed from production quickly, an alternative to a national recall may be possible, thereby minimizing the impact on sales and the company's position.",

            "model_answer": "1. Let's first analyze Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963) and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006)\n    - Hendrix (2002) proposed a planning model that revolves around a detailed marketing plan.\n    - Kendall (1999) suggested a planning model, \"MKAS,\" which stands for Mission, Key Result Areas (KRAs), Action Plan, and Strategy.\n    - Merston (1963) presented the \"SMART\" goals approach for planning purposes: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.\n    - Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) focused on human resources planning that involved aligning skills with strategic goals.\n\n2. Let's compare the common aspects of all four models.\n    - All four models share a focus on strategic goals and planning activities that support these goals.\n    - Hendrix (2002) discusses detailed marketing plans, which sets a goal to achieve. The other models likewise focus on setting goals.\n    - Kendall (1999) stresses the importance of Mission, Key Result Areas (KRAs), and Action Plan, all of which involve setting goals that align with strategic objectives.\n    - Merston (1963)'s \"SMART\" goals approach is explicitly focused on setting performance goals that align with the company's strategies.\n    - Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) emphasize the alignment of skills with strategic goals, which also involves setting goals to achieve.\n\n3. Based on this comparison, the two elements that are common across all four models are planning that focuses on strategic goals and setting goals to achieve.\n\n4. We can now conclude that the common elements between Hendrix (2002), Kendall (1999), Merston (1963), and Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) are:\n\n(A) Research and evaluation, (B) Strategy and evaluation, (C) Strategy and implementation, and (D) Objectives and implementation\n\n5. Let's collect one word or two-letter abbreviation to represent each common element.\n\n   - Hendrix (2002) focuses on marketing plans \u21d2 M (Marketing)\n   - Kendall (1999) focuses MKAS (Mission, KRAs, Action Plan, and Strategy) \u21d2 S (Strategic)\n   - Merston (1963) focuses on Smart goals with SMART acronym \u21d2 S (Smart)\n   - Parkinson and Ekachai (2006) focuses on human resources planning \u21d2 S (Strategic)\n\n6. Finally, we can combine the one word/abbreviation for each of the four models and keep the options that can represent each common element.\n\n   - M (Marketing)\n   - S (Strategic)\n\n7. After merging M (Marketing) and S (Strategic) from each model, the answer becomes:\n\n(A) M and S\n\n8.
