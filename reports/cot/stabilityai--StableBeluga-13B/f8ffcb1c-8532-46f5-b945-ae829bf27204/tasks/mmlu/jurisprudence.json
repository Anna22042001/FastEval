            "model_answer": "To determine in which of the following the idea of 'natural law' first appeared, let's analyze each option step-by-step:\n\n(A) French Revolution: The French Revolution was a period of political and social upheaval in France, which took place between 1789 and 1799. It was a time when the monarchy was overthrown and a new government was established. While the French Revolution did have an impact on the development of political and legal ideas, it is not the primary source of the concept of 'natural law.'\n\n(B) American War of Independence: The American War of Independence, also known as the American Revolution, took place between 1775 and 1783. It was a conflict between the thirteen American colonies and Great Britain, which led to the formation of the United States. While the American Revolution did have an impact on the development of political and legal ideas, it is not the primary source of the concept of 'natural law.'\n\n(C) Roman Law: Roman law is a legal system that was developed in ancient Rome and had a significant influence on the development of legal systems in Europe and beyond. Roman law is based on the idea of natural law, which holds that there are certain universal principles that govern human behavior and that these principles are inherent in nature. Therefore, Roman law is the primary source of the concept of 'natural law.'\n\n(D) Greek Thinking: Greek thinking refers to the philosophical and intellectual traditions of ancient Greece, which had a significant impact on Western civilization. While Greek thinking did contribute to the development of ideas related to natural law, it is not the primary source of the concept of 'natural law.'\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n(C) Roman Law",

It is a standard of care that is applied to all individuals, regardless of their personal characteristics.\n\n(B) The reasonable person standard focuses on the defendant's subjective mental state rather than on the defendant's behavior.\n\nThis statement is incorrect because the reasonable person standard focuses on the objective standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in a similar situation.
