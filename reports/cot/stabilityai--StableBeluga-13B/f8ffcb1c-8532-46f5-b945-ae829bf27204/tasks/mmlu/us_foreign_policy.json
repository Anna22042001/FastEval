            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question\nThe question asks why countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market, despite the fact that international trade is generally beneficial for both countries.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the given options\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership - This option suggests that the leadership is making irrational decisions, which is not a valid reason for countries to protect their firms from the world market.\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed - This option suggests that the costs of free trade are concentrated on a few firms, while the benefits are dispersed among the population. This could be a reason for countries to protect their firms, but it doesn't fully explain the behavior.\n(C) Regime type - This option suggests that the regime type (e.g., democracy, autocracy, etc.) could be a factor in a country's decision to protect its firms. However, this option does not provide a clear explanation for the behavior.\n(D) International conflict prevents trade - This option suggests that international conflict could be a reason for countries to protect their firms from the world market.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best option\nOption (D) International conflict prevents trade is the best option, as it explains that countries may protect their firms from the world market due to international conflict, which could lead to trade barriers and protectionism.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer the question, let's break down the phrase 'empire by invitation' and analyze each option.\n\n1. 'Voluntary reliance on an external power for security' (A) - This option refers to a situation where a country or region seeks the protection of a more powerful entity, often in exchange for some form of control or influence.\n\n2. 'Willful openness to colonization' (B) - This option refers to a situation where a country or region willingly allows another entity to colonize or control them, often for economic or political gain.\n\n3. 'Cultural imperialism' (C) - This option refers to the imposition of a dominant culture's values, beliefs, and practices onto another culture, often through force or influence.\n\n4. 'Open advocacy of imperialism for economic gain' (D) - This option refers to a situation where a country or region actively promotes imperialism, often for the purpose of economic gain or expansion.\n\nNow, let's analyze the phrase 'empire by invitation' and see which option best fits the meaning. The phrase suggests that the empire in question was established or expanded through the invitation or consent of the people or countries involved.\n\nOption A (Voluntary reliance on an external power for security) and Option B (Willful openness to colonization) both involve some form of consent or invitation, but they do not fully capture the meaning of the phrase 'empire by invitation.'\n\nOption C (Cultural imperialism) and Option D (Open advocacy of imperialism for economic gain) both involve some form of imperialism, but they do not involve the concept of invitation or consent.\n\nBased on the analysis, the best option that fits the meaning of 'empire by invitation' is:\n\n(A) Voluntary reliance on an external power for security",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. World War I began in Europe and lasted from 1914 to 1918.\n2. The war caused significant damage to European infrastructure and economies.\n3. The United States remained neutral during the war until 1917, when it joined the Allied forces.\n4. The United States provided significant financial and military support to the Allies during the war.\n5. After the war, the United States emerged as a major economic power due to its industrial capacity and financial resources.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) The war reduced European population levels below that of the United States - This option is incorrect because the war did not significantly reduce European population levels.\n\n(B) The United States seized German resources after the war - This option is incorrect because the United States did not seize German resources after the war.\n\n(C) European countries paid the United States for assistance - This option is partially correct because European countries did pay the United States for assistance, but it was not the primary factor in shifting economic power.\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy - This option is the most accurate because it highlights the significant role of the United States in financing the war and the subsequent economic growth.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, let's first understand the concept of international trade agreements and the mechanisms involved in them.\n\nInternational trade agreements are formalized arrangements between countries to regulate and facilitate trade between them. These agreements aim to promote economic growth, reduce trade barriers, and ensure fair competition among participating countries.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\n(A) Reciprocity across multiple issues: This mechanism involves countries agreeing to make concessions on various issues in exchange for concessions from other countries. This helps in balancing the benefits and costs of trade for all parties involved.\n\n(B) Reputational concerns of the actors: This mechanism refers to the concern of countries about their reputation in the international community. Countries may be more inclined to cooperate and adhere to trade agreements to maintain a positive image and avoid negative consequences.\n\n(C) Side payments for adjusting to the organization (such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU): This mechanism involves financial incentives or subsidies provided by the organization to help countries adjust to the new trade rules and regulations. This can be seen in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union, which provides financial support to farmers to help them adapt to the EU's agricultural policies.\n\n(D) ALL of the above: This option suggests that all the given mechanisms are used in international trade agreements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer:\n\n(D) ALL of the above\n\nThe answer is (D) ALL of the above because international trade agreements use multiple mechanisms to facilitate and regulate trade between countries.
