            "model_answer": ": NGS is a powerful tool for sequencing DNA or RNA molecules. It is most often used to identify mutations or variations in a person's DNA that may be associated with disease or other health conditions. NGS can also be used to identify new viruses or other organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that may be causing an infection or other health problem. However, NGS cannot be used to search for drug-resistant mutants, as this would require a different type of sequencing technology.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": \nRandomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for the placebo effect. This is because the placebo group is often not representative of the general population, and therefore their results may not be generalizable to other populations. By randomly assigning subjects to either the treatment or placebo group, any differences between the groups can be attributed to the treatment being studied, rather than other factors such as the placebo effect. This helps to control for the placebo effect and increase the validity of the study results.",

The given options are (A) Clinical trial, (B) Double-blind, (C) Longitudinal, and (D) Prospective cohort. \nThe correct answer is (D) Prospective cohort. \nProspective cohort studies involve a group of people who are followed over time and are observed for an outcome of interest. In this type of study, participants are recruited and followed up at regular intervals, and data is collected on various measures. This type of study design is useful for studying the long-term effects of a toxin or other environmental factor. \nIn contrast, clinical trials involve a group of people who are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group receives the experimental treatment, while the control group receives a placebo or no treatment. This type of study design is useful for testing the efficacy of a new treatment or drug. \nDouble-blind studies involve a group of people who are randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group, but neither the participants nor the researchers know which group is which. This type of study design is useful for testing the efficacy of a new treatment or drug, as it helps to control for any potential biases that might arise due to the participants knowing which group they are in. \nLongitudinal studies involve a group of people who are followed up over time and are observed for an outcome of interest. This type of study design is useful for studying the long-term effects of a toxin or other environmental factor, as it allows for the collection of data over a longer period of time.",

This means that the virus can be transmitted from an infected person to another person through direct contact with the infected person's faeces or by touching a surface contaminated with the faeces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. This is in contrast to the other three options, which describe different modes of transmission of the virus. Option (A) is incorrect because MERS is not primarily transmitted through the aerosol droplet route, as is the case with influenza. Option (B) is incorrect because MERS is not primarily transmitted through direct contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions, as is the case with tuberculosis. Option (C) is incorrect because MERS is not primarily transmitted through contact with animals, as is the case with rabies. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) A conduit to humans via camels.",

            "model_answer": ": Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent disease. This is because vaccines work by introducing a small, harmless piece of the virus or bacteria into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies that can recognize and fight off the disease. Antivirals work by directly attacking the virus or bacteria, but they are often less effective and can have side effects. Hygiene practices such as handwashing can help reduce the spread of disease, but they do not prevent infection. Mosquito nets can help prevent the spread of malaria, but they do not prevent all cases of the disease. Therefore, the answer is (A) Vaccines.",
