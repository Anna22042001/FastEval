            "model_answer": ": According to Hourdequin, individualism leads us into two problems. The first problem is a failure of developing integration and integrality. This means that individualism can lead to a lack of connection and wholeness in our lives and in our society. The second problem is that individualism can lead to \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and instill in us an atomistic view of persons. This means that individualism can lead to situations where everyone acts in their own self-interest, leading to a breakdown in social cooperation and a lack of concern for the common good.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": \nPhilippa Foot explains the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction by appealing to the rights of noninterference. This means that we have a moral duty to refrain from interfering with the actions of others, unless they harm others or their actions are unjust. In the case of letting someone die, we are interfering with their actions and therefore have a moral duty to prevent it. However, in the case of killing someone, we are not interfering with their actions and therefore do not have a moral duty to prevent it. This distinction is based on the idea that we have a moral duty to respect the autonomy and dignity of others, and letting someone die is seen as a violation of this right. Therefore, we have a moral duty to prevent it, while killing is not seen as a violation of this right and does not require us to interfere.",

            "question": " Against Kant's view of sexual objectification, Papadaki argues that\n\n(A) it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity.\n(B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.\n(C) sexual objectification actually enhances humanity.\n(D) Papadaki actually agrees with Kant's view",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity. Kant's view of sexual objectification holds that any form of sexual use that does not involve a genuine concern for the other's humanity is wrong. Papadaki argues that it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity, as sexual use can be a way of expressing love and affection between partners. Therefore, sexual use does not necessarily sacrifice humanity. \n(B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity. Kant's view of sexual objectification is based on the idea that any form of sexual use that does not involve a genuine concern for the other's humanity is wrong. However, Papadaki argues that the wrong of sexual objectification should be understood in terms of the other's autonomy and dignity, rather than their humanity. Therefore, Kant's view is limited in its understanding of the wrong of sexual objectification.\n(C) sexual objectification actually enhances humanity. Papadaki argues that sexual objectification can enhance humanity by promoting sexual pleasure and intimacy between partners. By treating the other as an object of sexual desire, partners can deepen their connection and intimacy. Therefore, sexual objectification can enhance humanity, at least in some cases.\n(D) Papadaki actually agrees with Kant's view of sexual objectification. Papadaki's argument is that sexual objectification is not always wrong, and can enhance humanity in some cases. Therefore, Papadaki agrees with Kant's view of sexual objectification, to some extent.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \nRichardson-Self argues that sexist speech is always hate speech because it involves violence. This is because hate speech is defined as speech that is intended to harm or offend someone based on their race, religion, gender, etc. Since sexist speech is intended to harm or offend someone based on their gender, it is considered hate speech. Additionally, hate speech is often accompanied by physical violence, which further supports the argument that sexist speech is always hate speech. Therefore, the answer is (A).",
