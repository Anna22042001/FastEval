            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": International trade can benefit both countries by increasing economic growth, creating jobs, and increasing living standards. However, there are also costs associated with trade, such as the loss of domestic jobs and the potential for lower wages. Countries may try to protect their own firms from foreign competition in order to prevent these costs from being borne by their own citizens. This can take the form of tariffs, quotas, or other trade barriers. However, these protectionist policies can also have negative consequences, such as reducing the overall benefits of trade and increasing the costs for consumers. Therefore, countries often have to balance the benefits and costs of trade, and may choose to pursue policies that promote both growth and protection for their own firms.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": In his book The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, Paul Kennedy argues that all of the world's leading economies were in decline due to low growth and inflation. This decline was not caused by any one specific factor, but rather by a combination of economic, political, and social factors. While the United States was not immune to these trends, Kennedy argues that it was able to avoid decline due to its strong military and soft power. The rise of Japan had been exaggerated in previous decades, and while it was a significant economic force, it was not a threat to the United States' status as a superpower.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": The phrase 'empire by invitation' refers to a type of imperialism in which a country seeks to expand its influence through invitation rather than coercion. This can involve offering economic or political assistance to a weaker nation, or forming alliances or partnerships with other countries. In this type of imperialism, the invading country does not seek to forcibly take control of the target nation, but rather to establish a relationship of mutual benefit. The answer is (B) Willful openness to colonization.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy. \nDuring World War I, the United States emerged as a major creditor country and financial centre, as European countries turned to the United States for assistance in financing the war. This led to an increase in US economic power, as the country became a major player in global finance and trade. Additionally, the war led to a decrease in European population levels, which further boosted the United States as a population-rich country with a growing economy.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Foreign policies of other states are one possible constraint on US foreign policy decision making. This is because the actions and policies of other states can have a significant impact on the US, and the US must often consider the potential consequences of its own actions on other states. International law is another possible constraint, as the US is bound by a variety of international legal obligations and must often consider the legal implications of its actions. Intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations, can also be a constraint on US foreign policy decision making, as the US may be required to cooperate with other states or organizations on certain issues. Finally, all of these factors can be constraints on US foreign policy decision making, as they can all impact the options available to the US and the decisions that it ultimately makes.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": The Moscow Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, also known as the Moscow Treaty or the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (SART), was a bilateral arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, signed on December 8, 1991. The treaty called for the reduction of nuclear weapons and delivery systems held by both countries, with a goal of reducing the number of deployed nuclear warheads from 6,000 to no more than 6,000. The treaty also included provisions for the destruction of certain types of nuclear weapons and the reduction of military bases in both countries. The treaty was the first major arms control agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of the Cold War, and it played a key role in reducing the risk of nuclear war between the two countries. The answer is (B) Required the United States and Russia to dismantle a significant number of their nuclear weapons.",

This is because the international environment can have a significant impact on the foreign policy decisions of a country, including its allies and enemies, the balance of power in a region, and the availability of resources and opportunities for cooperation or conflict. While the domestic environment, government and bureaucracy, and the President's individual personality can also play a role in shaping foreign policy, they are ultimately influenced by and respond to the broader international context. Therefore, the external environment is the most important factor to consider in explaining the foreign policy behavior of the United States.",

Specifically, they use reciprocity across multiple issues to establish a framework for trade, reputational concerns of the actors to ensure that all parties adhere to the agreement, side payments for adjusting to the organization such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU to ensure that all parties have an incentive to comply with the agreement, and they also use regulatory cooperation to ensure that all parties have a common understanding of the rules of trade.

Reagan's military spending during his first term was high, and this put pressure on the Soviet Union to keep up its international commitments. However, Reagan also reduced military spending in his second term, which allowed the Soviet Union to reform and eventually collapse. While Reagan's military spending may have put pressure on the Soviet Union, it was his willingness to engage with the Soviet Union and his softer approach towards communism that ultimately led to the Soviet Union's collapse.",

            "model_answer": ": American exceptionalism is a political and cultural belief that the United States is a unique and special nation, with a special mission and role to play in the world. This belief can lead to opposition to world government because it is based on the idea that the United States should be able to govern itself and pursue its own interests without interference from other countries. Additionally, American exceptionalism often emphasizes individualism and anti-statism, which can lead to a resistance to centralized government and the idea of a global government that would impose rules and regulations on the United States. Therefore, the answer is (B) It views world government as impractical.",
