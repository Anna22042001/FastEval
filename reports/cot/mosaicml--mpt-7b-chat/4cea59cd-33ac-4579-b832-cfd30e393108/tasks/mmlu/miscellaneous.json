Unfortunately, this information is not readily available. However, we can make an educated guess based on the number of households in the United States and the average number of movies watched per household. \nAssuming there are approximately 100 million households in the United States, and the average number of movies watched per household is 2 movies per month (which is a very low estimate), then the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year would be 200,000,000. \nTherefore, the answer is (A) 200,000,000.",
