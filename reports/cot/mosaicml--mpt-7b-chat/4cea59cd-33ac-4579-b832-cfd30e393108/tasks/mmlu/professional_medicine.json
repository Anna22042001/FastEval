The use of various conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been ineffective. Sulfasalazine treatment also has not resulted in improvement. The most appropriate next step in treatment is administration of a drug that inhibits which of the following?\n\n(A) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4\n(B) Epidermal growth factor\n(C) Interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n(D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1",

This is because IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis. The other options listed in the question (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, Epidermal growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1) are not relevant to the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis.

            "question": "A 33-year-old female presents to the office with the complaint of chronic pelvic pain that began after she underwent a hysterectomy 6\u00a0months ago. Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) collateral estoppel is the most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient. This term refers to a legal doctrine that prevents a party from denying or challenging a claim that has been previously litigated in a lawsuit. In this case, the plaintiff has established that the sponge was left behind during surgery, and the defendant cannot deny this fact due to collateral estoppel. Proximate cause refers to the legal concept of determining the cause of an injury, and is not relevant in this case. Res ipsa loquitur is a Latin term that means \"the thing speaks for itself\" and is used to establish negligence in a case where the circumstances are so unusual that it is impossible for the defendant to have been unaware of the risk. This is not relevant in this case as the sponge was left behind intentionally. Respondeat superior is a legal doctrine that holds an employer liable for the actions of their employees that occur within the course and scope of their employment. This is not relevant in this case as the sponge was left by a surgeon, not an employee of the hospital or surgeon's office. Therefore, the answer is (A) collateral estoppel.",

This is because the patient's symptoms of dizziness and light-headedness, as well as her history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, suggest that she may have a cardiac problem such as a coronary artery disease or a heart valve disease. Cardiac stress scintigraphy is a non-invasive test that can help to identify the presence of a cardiac problem by measuring the blood flow in the heart during exercise. Adjusting her medication regimen and warfarin therapy are not appropriate next steps in management, as they do not specifically address the patient's symptoms or diagnosis. Transesophageal echocardiography is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest any cardiac pathology.",
