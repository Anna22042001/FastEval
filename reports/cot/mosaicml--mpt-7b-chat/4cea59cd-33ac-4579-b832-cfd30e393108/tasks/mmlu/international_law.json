Individuals do not have the same level of legal personality as states and international organisations. They are not recognized as independent actors in international law and cannot exercise all the rights and duties that states and international organisations can. However, individuals can still participate in international law through various means such as signing treaties, joining international organisations, and bringing cases before international courts.",

This means that the interpretation of the treaties must be flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances, and that the treaties must be applied in a way that is consistent with the evolving standards of human rights.\n\nThe cases of Golder v UK (1978), A v UK (2009), Goodwin v UK (2002), and Osman v UK (1998) all involve challenges to UK laws or policies that were found to be in violation of international human rights standards. In each case, the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK was in violation of its obligations under international human rights treaties, and that the UK laws or policies at issue were not consistent with the values and principles embodied in those treaties.
