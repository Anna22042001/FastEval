Hormones secreted by the mother's ovaries and hypothalamus can also trigger labor, but prostaglandins are the primary hormone responsible for the onset of labor. Hormones secreted by the fetus' adrenal gland cannot trigger labor on their own, but they can affect the timing of labor.",

This theory suggests that exposure to erotica can lead to imitative behavior and the development of sexual attitudes and behaviors. This is because the brain is wired to imitate and learn from others, and exposure to sexual stimuli can trigger these impulses.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Menstruation is the shedding of the inner lining of the uterus. During menstruation, the uterine lining sheds and is expelled from the body. This process occurs once a month in healthy women, and is necessary for the reproductive cycle to continue. The menstrual cycle is regulated by hormones produced by the ovaries, and is a complex process that involves several phases, including the follicular phase and the luteal phase. Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and is necessary for pregnancy to occur.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Sperm passage is most hospitable just at the preovulation stage of a woman's menstrual cycle. This is because the uterus is at its smallest size at this time, allowing for easier passage of the sperm through the fallopian tubes. Additionally, the release of the hormone estrogen at preovulation helps to prepare the uterus for pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus and the uterine lining, making it more receptive to sperm. Therefore, the answer is (A) preovulation.",

These bacteria most often infect the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder. However, it is possible for the bacteria to infect other areas of the body as well, including the penis, scrotum (which is the skin sack that contains the testes), and bladder.

Female sterilization can be achieved through various methods, such as tubal ligation, a hysterectomy, or a bilateral oophorectomy. These surgical procedures permanently remove the fallopian tubes, uterus, or both ovaries, respectively, which prevents the release of eggs and the production of hormones such as estrogen and progesterone.
