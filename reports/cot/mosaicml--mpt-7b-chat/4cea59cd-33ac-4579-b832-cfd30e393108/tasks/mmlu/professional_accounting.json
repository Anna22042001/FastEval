According to GAAP, a company must disclose information about its operating segments if the segments are significant in terms of their ability to generate revenues and incur expenses. \nIn this case, we see that Swift has three operating segments (A, B, and C) that may require separate disclosure. However, we also see that the total revenue, profit, and assets for each segment are included in the total amounts for each segment. This suggests that the segments are not significant in terms of their ability to generate revenues and incur expenses, and therefore are not required to be separately disclosed. \nTherefore, the answer is (D) A B and C.",

This condition is necessary to ensure that only serious requests for inspection are made. \nHowever, the right to inspect is not absolute and requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.
