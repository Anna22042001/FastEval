            "model_answer": ": \nThe United States is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry among the options given. This is because the United States is a large and populous country with a high level of industrialization, and it relies heavily on imports of natural resources such as oil, natural gas, and minerals. In contrast, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom are all more self-sufficient in natural resources, as they have significant reserves of their own natural resources that can be used for industrial purposes.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as (B) relocation diffusion. This is because the information is relayed from person to person who are physically close to each other, rather than through distant communication channels such as television or radio. As the information spreads, it becomes more widely accepted and eventually reaches a tipping point where it becomes a popular trend. This process is known as the \"diffusion of innovation,\" and it is a key factor in the spread of new ideas and trends in many fields, including fashion.",

            "model_answer": ": \nThe correct answer is (D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade. This statement is not part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation because it suggests that regions with initial advantage can maintain and expand their advantage through labor, capital, and trade. This is in contrast to Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation, which suggests that regions with initial advantage will eventually lose their advantage due to the accumulation of disadvantages over time.

A world city is a large urban center that is a major economic, political, and cultural center in the world. \nFrom this definition, we can see that world cities are typically centers of economic and political power, and contain many multinational organizations and headquarters of transnational corporations. \nOption (A) is correct, as world cities often contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations. \nOption (B) is also correct, as world cities are well connected to secondary-level world cities. \nOption (C) is also correct, as world cities contain many offices of multinational organizations. \nOption (D) is incorrect, as world cities are found in both the northern and western hemispheres. \nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. The answer is (C) agglomeration. \nExplanation: The term agglomeration refers to the clustering of people and businesses in a particular area due to the presence of certain factors that attract them to that area. These factors can include things like access to transportation, availability of resources, and the presence of other businesses and industries. Agglomeration is often seen as a key driver of economic growth and development, as it allows businesses and people to benefit from the synergies that arise from being in close proximity to other similar entities. The substitution principle refers to the idea of substituting one thing for another, while deglomeration refers to the opposite process of dispersing activities and people from a particular area. Infrastructure refers to the physical facilities and systems that support economic activity, but it is not directly related to the clustering of people and businesses.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. To answer this question, we need to understand what the terms primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary mean. These terms are used to describe the different levels of economic activity. Primary activities involve the extraction of natural resources, such as agriculture, fishing, and mining. Secondary activities involve the processing and manufacturing of raw materials, such as manufacturing and construction. Tertiary activities involve the provision of services, such as education, healthcare, and finance. Quaternary activities involve the use of technology, such as research and development. Based on this information, we can conclude that the majority of workers in periphery countries are probably employed in tertiary and quaternary activities.
