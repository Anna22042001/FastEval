            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \nThis scenario is best explained by the theory of emotions known as Schachter-Singer. This theory states that emotions are a response to a specific stimulus, and that the intensity of the emotion is determined by the perceived threat or danger of the stimulus. In this case, Antoinette's heart began to race and she shrieked when she first saw her friends jumping out at her, which suggests that she perceived the situation as a threat. However, once she recognized that it was her friends throwing a surprise party, her heart continued to race, but she experienced happiness. This suggests that she still perceived the situation as a threat, but the stimulus was no longer perceived as dangerous, which caused her to experience happiness. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Schachter-Singer.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. When a person experiences physiological arousal, it is typically characterized by an increase in heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure. These physical responses are often accompanied by other symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and increased muscle tension. While dilation of the pupils is a common symptom of physiological arousal, it is not a necessary characteristic. Therefore, option (A) is not the correct answer. Option (B) is also incorrect as an increase in salivation is not a characteristic of physiological arousal. The correct answer is option (D), which is an increase in secretion of stress hormones.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": (D) conditioning experiments are no longer done. While it may have been possible in the past to condition a baby to fear a rat through a process called classical conditioning, this method is no longer considered ethical and is no longer used in research studies. Today, researchers must adhere to strict ethical guidelines that prioritize the safety and well-being of participants, and studies involving infants and young children are particularly closely regulated. Therefore, it is unlikely that a psychologist could condition a baby to fear a rat in a research study at a university today.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": The correct answer is (C) Ecological. \nExplanation: The question is asking for the type of assessment that attempts to identify the most pressing behavioral problem, and possible ways to alleviate it, by investigating the relationship between aspects of an individual's environment and behavior. The correct answer is ecological because this type of assessment looks at how an individual's behavior is influenced by their social and physical environment, as well as their personal characteristics. Personality, cognitive, and curriculum-based assessments focus on individual characteristics and internal factors, while ecological assessments consider external factors that can impact behavior.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Narcolepsy is the most likely diagnosis for an obese individual with a breathing-related sleep disorder and symptoms of sudden uncontrollable sleepiness and lack of sleepiness during the day. This is because narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to regulate sleep and wakefulness, causing excessive daytime sleepiness and disrupted sleep patterns. Sleep apnea, on the other hand, is a condition in which the airway becomes partially or completely blocked during sleep, causing interruptions in breathing and potentially life-threatening complications. Hypersomnia and insomnia are other possible diagnoses, but they are less likely in this case as the individual's breathing-related sleep disorder is likely causing the excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Brittany's behavior illustrates\n\n(A) stereotyping\n(B) the fundamental attribution error\n(C) the mere exposure effect\n(D) the reciprocity norm",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. \n(A) Stereotyping refers to the tendency to make judgments or assumptions about a group of people based on stereotypes or preconceived notions. In this case, Brittany's behavior of mailing a donation to the charity that sent the address stickers may be an example of stereotyping, as she may have assumed that the charity was a legitimate organization and that mailing a donation was the appropriate response to receiving the stickers. \n(B) The fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias in which people tend to attribute positive or negative behaviors to the person's character rather than the situation or circumstances. In this case, Brittany's behavior may be an example of the fundamental attribution error, as she may have attributed her decision to mail a donation to her own personal character or values rather than the specific circumstances of receiving the address stickers. \n(C) The mere exposure effect is a cognitive bias in which people tend to like or dislike something after only a brief exposure to it. In this case, Brittany's behavior may be an example of the mere exposure effect, as she may have developed a positive impression of the charity after receiving the address stickers and therefore felt obligated to mail a donation. \n(D) The reciprocity norm is a social norm that states that people should return favors or perform helpful actions for others. In this case, Brittany's behavior may be an example of the reciprocity norm, as she may have felt obligated to mail a donation to the charity in response to receiving the address stickers.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. When most people hear that the World Trade Center was destroyed, they experience a sudden and intense memory of the event. This type of memory is called a flashbulb memory. Flashbulb memories are characterized by a high level of clarity and vividness, and they are often accompanied by strong emotions. While there are other types of memory, such as implicit memory and explicit memory, flashbulb memories are particularly powerful and memorable. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) flashbulb memory.",

The left hemisphere of the brain is typically dominant for language and analytical reasoning, while the right hemisphere is dominant for spatial tasks and mathematical reasoning. This is because the left hemisphere is responsible for language and logical reasoning, while the right hemisphere is responsible for spatial tasks and mathematical reasoning. However, it is important to note that not all people have a clear dominance for either hemisphere, and some may have equal dominance or even opposite dominance for the two hemispheres.",

The hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the brain that plays a key role in regulating many important bodily functions, including hunger and eating. The hypothalamus receives information from various sources, including the senses, hormones, and other parts of the brain, and uses this information to control hunger and other related processes. The somatosensory cortex, the medulla oblongata, and the occipital lobes are other important regions of the brain that contribute to these processes, but the hypothalamus is the primary regulatory center for hunger and eating.",
