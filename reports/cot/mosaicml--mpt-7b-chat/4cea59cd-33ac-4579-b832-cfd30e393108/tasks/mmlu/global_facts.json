            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. The global fertility rate refers to the average number of children that a woman is expected to have in her lifetime. This rate is influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural norms, economic conditions, and access to family planning services. In 2015, the global fertility rate was estimated to be around 2.5 children per woman, which is considered to be a relatively high rate. This means that there are more children being born per woman than in many other parts of the world. The other options listed in the question are also possible, but they would require a slightly different interpretation of the term \"global fertility rate\". For example, (C) 3.5 children per woman would mean that a third of women are expected to have three or more children, while (D) 4.5 children per woman would mean that a quarter of women are expected to have four or more children.",
