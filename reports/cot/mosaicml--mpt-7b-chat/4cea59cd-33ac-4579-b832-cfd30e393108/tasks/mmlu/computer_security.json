This can happen when an attacker sends a large amount of data to a program through a network connection, or when a program attempts to read or write more data to a buffer than it is allowed to. In the case of C and C++, the most common cause of buffer overflow is the lack of string boundary checks in predefined functions. This means that if a program uses a function that does not check the length of a string being passed to it, it can potentially write past the end of the buffer and overwrite memory that it should not be writing to. Other causes of buffer overflow include the lack of storage checks in external memory, the lack of processing power checks, and the lack of database checks.",

This can be done by sending a large amount of data to a program through a network connection or by tricking a program into reading and writing data from a malicious source. In the case of old operating systems like Windows 3.1 and NT-based systems, this vulnerability was particularly common due to the way these systems handled memory management. Specifically, these systems used a technique called \"stack-based buffer overflow\" where the program's stack is used as a memory buffer. If an attacker is able to write more data to this buffer than what is allowed, the program will attempt to read that data from the buffer, potentially overwriting other data in memory and causing the program to crash or execute malicious code.\n\nAnswer: (D) UNIX",

It sits between the devices and acts as a go-between, passing data back and forth. \nThe data link layer is the lowest layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual framework used to understand how different layers of a computer network work together. The data link layer is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably between devices, and that it is received in the same order that it was sent. \nTherefore, since a proxy rewall lters at the data link layer, it is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably between devices, and that it is received in the same order that it was sent. \nI hope this explanation helps!",
