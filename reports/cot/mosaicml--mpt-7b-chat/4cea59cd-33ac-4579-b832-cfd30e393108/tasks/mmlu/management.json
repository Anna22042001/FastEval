            "model_answer": ": (A) Team culture is a type of culture in which workers are expected to work together towards a common goal and are encouraged to share ideas and opinions. In this type of culture, workers are more likely to accept change and are less likely to resist it. This is because they feel that their contributions are valued and that their opinions are heard. In contrast, group culture is a type of culture in which workers are expected to follow the norms and values of the group and are less likely to accept change. Collective culture is a type of culture in which workers are expected to work together for the common good, but may not necessarily accept change.",

Henry Fayol was a French management theorist who is best known for his work on administrative management. He developed the concept of the \"five functions of management,\" which include planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Fayol believed that effective management required a hierarchical structure with clear lines of authority and communication, and that managers should focus on achieving efficiency and consistency in their operations. He also emphasized the importance of training and education for managers, and the need for continuous improvement in organizational processes. Fayol's work on bureaucratic structures has had a significant influence on modern management practices, particularly in the public sector.",

In this case, the acquisition takes place when the two companies or entities agree to work together and combine their operations.\n(B) Two equal partners share resources: This type of acquisition occurs when two companies or entities agree to share resources, such as equipment, facilities, or personnel. This can take place for a variety of reasons, such as to reduce costs or to increase efficiency. In this case, the acquisition takes place when the two companies or entities agree to share resources and work together.\n(C) Two unequal partners join together: This type of acquisition occurs when two companies or entities agree to join together, but one company or entity is significantly larger or more powerful than the other. This can take place for a variety of reasons, such as to gain access to new markets or to increase their market share. In this case, the acquisition takes place when the two companies or entities agree to join together, but one company or entity will have a significant advantage over the other.\n(D) Two unequal partners become one after a buyout: This type of acquisition occurs when one company or entity acquires the other, but the two companies or entities remain separate entities.
