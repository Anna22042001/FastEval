            "model_answer": ": \n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all. \nThe reason for this is that the angular separation between the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes, which means that your eyes cannot distinguish between the two stars because they are too close together. As a result, they will appear as a single point of light.",

            "model_answer": ": In astronomy, the bolometric luminosity is the total amount of energy emitted by an object per unit time, regardless of the wavelength at which that energy is emitted. It is calculated by integrating the object's luminosity over all wavelengths, from the shortest (such as X-rays or gamma-rays) to the longest (such as radio waves or infrared). The answer is (D), the luminosity integrated over all wavelengths.",

            "model_answer": ": (C) It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation. Earth's magnetic field is the strongest among the terrestrial planets because it has a partially molten metallic core that generates electric currents, which in turn create the magnetic field. This is in contrast to the other terrestrial planets, which have solid iron cores and slower rotation rates. The combination of a partially molten metallic core and rapid rotation is what gives Earth its strong magnetic field.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question! Saturn and Jupiter are both gas giants, but they have some differences in their atmospheres. One of these differences is that Jupiter has a much thicker atmosphere than Saturn. This is because Jupiter has a larger volume and a greater mass than Saturn, which means that it has more material to compress into a smaller space. Additionally, Jupiter has a much stronger magnetic field than Saturn, which causes the atmosphere to be more turbulent and to have more \"shear\" between different layers. This is why option (D) is not a similarity between Saturn and Jupiter's atmospheres.",

The outer planets formed from the lighter materials, while the inner planets formed from the denser materials that sank to the center of the nebula. This is because the outer planets were farther from the Sun and had more time to cool and condense, while the inner planets were closer to the Sun and had higher temperatures, allowing for the formation of denser materials.",

The solar nebula was composed of a mixture of gases, including hydrogen, helium, and other light gases such as methane and ammonia. It also contained small amounts of metals and rocks. \nFrom highest to lowest percentage of mass in the nebula, the order of the ingredients in the solar nebula would be: metals, rocks, hydrogen compounds (H2O CH4 NH3), light gases (H He), and finally hydrogen.

            "model_answer": ": Ptolemy's model of the universe, known as the geocentric model, held that the Earth was the center of the universe and that all celestial bodies, including the sun, revolved around it on circular orbits. In order to account for the varying distances of the planets from Earth, Ptolemy believed that the orbits of the planets were not simple circles, but rather circles upon circles, with each circle representing a different sphere of influence. This allowed him to explain why more distant planets took longer to make a circuit through the constellations of the zodiac, as well as why planets sometimes appeared to move westward rather than eastward relative to the stars in our sky. Ptolemy's model was later disproven by the observations of Galileo and other astronomers, leading to the development of the heliocentric model of the universe.
