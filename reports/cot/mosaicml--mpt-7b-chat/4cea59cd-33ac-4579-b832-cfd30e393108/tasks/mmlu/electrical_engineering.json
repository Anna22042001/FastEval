            "model_answer": ": In decimal number system, the MSD (Mean of Sum of Digits) is calculated by summing all the digits of a number and then finding the average of the sum. To find the MSD of a number, we first need to convert the number to a string of digits. For example, the number 1234 can be converted to the string \"1 2 3 4\". Then we sum all the digits in the string and find the average of the sum. In this case, the sum is 1+2+3+4=10 and the average of the sum is (10/1)+2+3+4=10.5. Therefore, the MSD of the number 1234 is 10.5.",

This is particularly true for direct core type induction furnaces, which have a large amount of metal in the core and a high frequency of operation.\nIf a high frequency supply is used, the electromagnetic forces generated by the furnace will cause the molten metal to be constantly stirred, which can lead to poor quality castings and increased energy consumption.\nTherefore, the answer is (A) With normal frequeny supply the electromagnetic forces causes severe stirring action in the molten metal.",
