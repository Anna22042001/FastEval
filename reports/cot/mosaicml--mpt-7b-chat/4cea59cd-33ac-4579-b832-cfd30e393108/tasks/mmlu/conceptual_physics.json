            "model_answer": ": General relativity is a theory of gravity that describes the behavior of massive objects in the universe. According to this theory, the gravitational field of a massive object like the Sun can affect the motion of objects near it, including light. \nOption (A) is incorrect because light is not affected by gravity. Instead, it is affected by the curvature of spacetime caused by the mass of the Sun. According to general relativity, the path of light passing near the Sun is curved due to the Sun\u2019s mass, but this does not cause the light to be slowed down or deflected.\nOption (B) is also incorrect because light passing the Sun is not deflected. Instead, it is bent due to the curvature of spacetime caused by the Sun\u2019s mass. This bending of light is what causes the apparent shift in the position of the Sun in the sky, which is called the solar eclipse.\nOption (C) is also incorrect because a clock on the Sun\u2019s surface would not run faster than a clock on Earth. Instead, the time on a clock on Earth would appear to slow down slightly due to the gravitational effect of the Sun\u2019s mass on the clock\u2019s movement.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) All of these.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": (A) reduces by 1. \nExplanation: When an element ejects a beta particle, it is actually losing an electron. Beta particles are high-energy electrons or positrons that are emitted from the nucleus of an atom. Since the ejected electron is part of the atom's electron cloud, the atomic number of the element decreases by 1. This is because the ejected electron is counted as part of the element's total number of electrons, and removing it reduces the total number of electrons by 1.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question! \nTo answer this question, we need to understand what a magnetic field is and how it interacts with electric charges. \nA magnetic field is created by the presence of electric charges, and it exerts a force on any other electric charges in the vicinity. The strength of the magnetic field is proportional to the amount of electric charge present, and it can be either attractive or repulsive. \nIn a closed loop of wire, if you change the magnetic field, electric charges will be induced in the wire. The amount of electric charge induced will depend on the direction and strength of the magnetic field. \nIf the magnetic field is changed in a way that causes the electric charges to move in a circular path, then a current will be created in the loop. If the magnetic field is changed in a way that causes the electric charges to move in a straight line, then a voltage will be created in the loop. If the magnetic field is changed in a way that causes the electric charges to move in a direction that is perpendicular to the wire, then an electric field will be created in the loop. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) All of these.",

The color wheel is a tool that helps us understand the relationships between colors. It shows all the primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) and their secondary colors (purple, green, and orange) as well as their complementary colors. \nThe complementary color of blue is magenta. To find this, we look at the color wheel and find the color opposite to blue. In this case, that is magenta. \nI hope this helps!",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": (A) breaking the sound barrier is the correct answer. A sonic boom is produced when an object travels faster than the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies depending on the temperature and pressure of the surrounding air, but it is typically around 1,200 feet per second at sea level. When an object travels faster than the speed of sound, it creates a shock wave that propagates through the air. This shock wave is what produces the sonic boom. The other options listed in the question are all incorrect, as they do not produce a sonic boom.",

This energy can be in the form of gamma radiation, kinetic energy of the alpha particle, kinetic energy of the neutron, or all of these about equally. However, the answer is (D) All of these about equally. This is because the gamma radiation and kinetic energy of the alpha particle and neutron are all forms of energy that are released during a fusion reaction. While the gamma radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, the kinetic energy of the alpha particle and neutron are forms of kinetic energy. Therefore, all of these forms of energy are released during a fusion reaction, and they are about equally important in terms of the overall energy released.",
