The Golgi apparatus is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face (the side facing the endoplasmic reticulum) is closest to the ER. This is because the Golgi apparatus receives proteins and lipids from the ER and modifies them before they are sent out to other parts of the cell or to the extracellular space.\n\n(B) is incorrect because the Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. These vesicles are actually found in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n(C) is incorrect because the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are not continuous with one another. Instead, they are separated by membranes called cisternal membranes.\n\n(D) is incorrect because glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs after the protein has entered the Golgi apparatus's cis face and before it is packaged in a vesicle and sent out of the cell.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Great! Let's break down the question and think through the possible options. First, we know that connective tissue is a type of tissue that connects and supports other tissues in the body. So, we can start by eliminating any options that are not related to this function. This leaves us with (A) thrombin, (B) glycosaminoglycans, (C) collagens, and (D) fibroblasts.\n\nNext, we can think about what connective tissue might be connected to or support. This would likely be other types of tissues in the body, such as muscles, bones, and organs. So, we can eliminate (D) fibroblasts, which are cells that produce connective tissue.\n\nNow, we're left with (A) thrombin, (B) glycosaminoglycans, and (C) collagens. Thrombin is a protein that helps to form blood clots, which is important for blood flow and wound healing. However, it is not directly related to the function of connective tissue.\n\nGlycosaminoglycans are molecules that are found in connective tissue and are important for its strength and elasticity. Collagens are proteins that make up the main structural components of connective tissue. Both of these options are directly related to the function of connective tissue, so we can eliminate (B) glycosaminoglycans and (C) collagens.\n\nFinally, we're left with (A) thrombin. This is a protein that is important for blood clotting and wound healing, but it is not directly related to the function of connective tissue. Therefore, the answer is (A) thrombin.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. I will now explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I will read the question carefully to understand what is being asked. I notice that the question asks me to identify a subunit of DNA and protein consisting of 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octomer.\n\nNext, I will use my knowledge of biology to try to identify the correct answer. I know that DNA is composed of long strands of nucleotides, and that these strands can be coiled up into structures called chromosomes. I also know that proteins are made up of amino acids, and that they can fold into specific shapes that allow them to interact with DNA.\n\nBased on this knowledge, I can infer that the subunit in question must be a chromatin, which is a complex of DNA and proteins that forms the basic unit of heredity. Chromatin consists of DNA wrapped around proteins called histones, and the 134-base-pair long stretches of DNA surrounding a protein octomer are called nucleosomes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) nucleosome.\n\nThe final answer is (C) nucleosome.",

            "model_answer": ":\nThe answer is (D). Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads. This is because the ZP2 glycoprotein is not the same as the ZP3 glycoprotein that the mouse sperm receptor proteins bind to in the zona pellucida of mouse eggs.
