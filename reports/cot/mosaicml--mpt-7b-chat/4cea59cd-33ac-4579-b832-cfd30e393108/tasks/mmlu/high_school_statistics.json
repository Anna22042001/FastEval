The mean (average) and mode (most common value) are not as good measures of central tendency for a group of salaries, because they can be heavily influenced by a few highly paid individuals.

A \u03c72 procedure is a statistical test that is used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two populations. It works by calculating the difference between the observed frequencies and the expected frequencies under a null hypothesis of no difference. \nThe expected frequencies are calculated using a \u03c72 distribution, which is a probability distribution that describes the number of times a particular event occurs in a given number of trials. The \u03c72 distribution has 2 degrees of freedom, which means that it describes the number of trials in the sample. \nFrom the question, we can see that the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5.
