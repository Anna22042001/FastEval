            "model_answer": ":\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. Brown and Harris found that women's susceptibility to stress is influenced by their levels of social support. Social support refers to the presence of people who provide emotional and practical assistance when needed. Research has shown that social support is important for mental health and can help protect against stress and depression. In this study, Brown and Harris found that women who had higher levels of social support were less susceptible to stress and therefore less likely to experience depression.",

            "model_answer": ": The embourgeoisement thesis suggests that capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority. This is because the thesis posits that as capitalism becomes more advanced and efficient, the role of the capitalist becomes less important and more managerial. This is in contrast to the traditional view of capitalism as a system in which the capitalist class owns the means of production and controls the distribution of goods and services. By contrast, in the embourgeoisement thesis, the capitalist class is replaced by salaried managers who exercise bureaucratic authority over the workforce. This is in line with the general trend in capitalism towards greater efficiency and managerial control, rather than ownership and control by a distinct capitalist class.",

            "model_answer": ": The four ideal types of social action that Weber identified were as follows: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and affective. \nExplanation: Max Weber was a German sociologist who developed the concept of ideal types, which are idealized and simplified representations of social phenomena. In his work, he identified four ideal types of social action, which he referred to as instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and affective. \nThe instrumentally-rational type of action is characterized by a focus on efficiency and effectiveness, with the goal of achieving a desired outcome. This type of action is often associated with modern, industrialized societies.\nThe value-rational type of action is characterized by a focus on moral or ethical considerations, with the goal of achieving a desired outcome that is considered good or right. This type of action is often associated with traditional societies.\nThe traditional type of action is characterized by a focus on tradition, with the goal of maintaining social order and stability. This type of action is often associated with rural or agrarian societies.\nThe affective type of action is characterized by a focus on emotions or feelings, with the goal of expressing or expressing oneself. This type of action is often associated with modern, postmodern, or post-structuralist societies.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ":\nThank you for the question. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n(1) The question states that there is a pattern of drug use in Britain, so we can assume that drug use is a fact that can be observed and measured.\n(2) The question then goes on to state that this drug use is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture. This means that drug use is no longer limited to a specific group of people who engage in drugs for pleasure. Instead, drug use is now more widespread and includes people of all ages and backgrounds.\n(3) The question then states that the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy. This means that Ecstasy is the most popular drug being used in Britain, and that it is widely available and popular among users.\n(4) The question then goes on to state that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This means that teenage girls are more likely to try illegal drugs like heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines than teenage boys.\n(5) The question then states that despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare. This means that while there may be public concern about drug use, in reality very few people in Britain are using illegal drugs.\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is (D) despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare.",

This is because Weber believed that class conflict arises from the unequal power dynamics between the working class and their capitalist employers.

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Covert participant observation is a research method in which the researcher is not openly present as an observer, but rather hides in order to observe people in their natural setting. The ethical problem with covert participant observation is that it can be difficult to record comprehensive fieldnotes and conversations, as the researcher may not be able to openly interact with the participants. Additionally, there is a risk of deceiving the participants as to the reason for the researcher's presence, which could potentially compromise the trust that the researcher has established with the participants. Observing people outside of their natural setting can also be problematic, as it may not provide a complete picture of their daily lives. Finally, subjecting participants to physical harm is never acceptable, and should always be avoided in any research study.
