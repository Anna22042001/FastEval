            "model_answer": ":\nThe answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil. \nThe atria contract and push blood into the ventricles. The ventricles then contract and push the blood out through the arteries. The arteries have elastic recoil, which means that when they are stretched, they return to their normal shape and size, allowing the blood to flow through them. This is why the blood continues to flow through the vessels even between contractions of the left ventricle.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is caused by the production of antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to hyperthyroidism. Ophthalmoplegia is a condition that affects the muscles of the eye and can be caused by a number of different disorders, including Graves disease. However, Graves disease is not a cause of ophthalmoplegia. A large multi-nodular goitre is a swelling of the thyroid gland that is common in Graves disease. Graves disease is commoner in males than females, and in the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck', which is a characteristic swelling of the neck that is also associated with Graves disease. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck'.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": \n\nThe correct answer is (C) the actin binding sites are uncovered. \nWhen a muscle fibre is activated, it undergoes a series of changes in order to contract. One of these changes is the binding of actin to the myosin heads at the Z-lines of the muscle fibre. This binding is facilitated by the binding of calcium ions to the thin filaments, which in turn causes the actin to bind to the myosin heads. \nHowever, when a muscle fibre is relaxed, the myosin heads are no longer bound to the actin at the Z-lines. This means that the thin filaments are no longer pulled apart by the myosin heads, and the muscle fibre is able to return to its normal, relaxed state. \nTherefore, the answer is (C) the actin binding sites are uncovered.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. In order to answer this question, we need to understand what high intensity exercise is and what factors contribute to fatigue during exercise. \nHigh intensity exercise is a type of physical activity that requires a lot of effort and is performed at a high intensity level. During high intensity exercise, the body requires a lot of energy to sustain the activity, which can lead to fatigue. \nThe cell concentration of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a key factor in the energy supply of the body during exercise. ADP is the energy source for muscle contraction, and when the concentration of ADP falls, the body has less energy to sustain the activity, which can lead to fatigue. \nInhibition of ATP production is another factor that can contribute to fatigue during exercise. When the body is exercising at a high intensity level, it requires a lot of energy to sustain the activity. If the body is unable to produce enough ATP to meet the demand, this can lead to fatigue. \nFailure of the ATP supply to match the demand is also a factor that can contribute to fatigue during exercise. If the body is exercising at a high intensity level, it requires a lot of energy to sustain the activity. If the supply of ATP is not able to meet the demand, this can lead to fatigue. \nLack of skill is not a factor that contributes to fatigue during exercise. While having good skill and technique can help to improve performance during exercise, it is not a factor that contributes to fatigue. \nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) inhibition of ATP production.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nOxygen is an essential element for life, and is required for many metabolic processes in the body. It is particularly important in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle), which is the main pathway by which cells generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from glucose. In this cycle, oxygen is used to generate carbon dioxide, which is then used to produce water, and to generate ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline have been shown to influence fatigue development. This is because acetylcholine and noradrenaline are both involved in the regulation of energy metabolism in the body, and their levels can affect fatigue. Specifically, acetylcholine is involved in the regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation, while noradrenaline is involved in the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, changes in these neurotransmitters can affect physical activity and energy expenditure, which can in turn influence fatigue development.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is (D) 5 days. \nTo arrive at this answer, we need to consider the following: \n- The patient has been on the operating table for four hours. \n- Pressure damage occurs when there is a sustained application of pressure to the skin for an extended period of time. \n- The amount of time it takes for pressure damage to become visible depends on the severity of the pressure and the area of the skin affected. \n- In this case, the patient has been under pressure for four hours, which is a relatively short amount of time. \n- Therefore, it is likely that any pressure damage caused by this procedure will be minimal and will not be visible for at least another 24 hours. \n- However, if the pressure was sustained for a longer period of time, the skin may become damaged and the patient may experience pain or other complications. \n- Therefore, it is important for medical professionals to monitor patients during procedures to ensure that the pressure is not excessive and that the patient is not experiencing any adverse effects. \n- The answer (D) 5 days is the minimum amount of time it may take for pressure damage to become visible, but this can vary depending on the severity of the pressure and the area affected.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": The complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise normally takes about 10 seconds. This is because phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that is stored in muscle fibers and is used to generate ATP, the energy currency of the cell. When muscle fibers are subjected to very high intensity exercise, such as sprinting or weightlifting, the demand for ATP increases rapidly. To meet this demand, phosphocreatine is broken down to creatine and phosphocreatine, and the creatine is then resynthesized back into phosphocreatine. This process takes about 10 seconds to complete, which is enough time for the muscle to generate the ATP needed for the exercise.",
