            "model_answer": ": \nTo solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the probability of an event, which is:\nP(A) = P(x < y) * P(A|x<y)\nwhere A is the event that $x < y$.\nWe know that the rectangle has vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$. We also know that the point is picked randomly, so we can assume that it is equally likely to be any point within the rectangle.\nTherefore, the probability that $x < y$ is simply the probability that the point is to the left of the vertical line through the origin. This probability is given by the area of the rectangle below the line, divided by the total area of the rectangle.\nThe area of the rectangle below the line is given by the difference between the areas of the two triangles formed by the line and the edges of the rectangle. The areas of these triangles are:\n$A_1 = \\frac{1}{2} h \\cdot w$\n$A_2 = \\frac{1}{2} h \\cdot w$\nwhere $h$ is the height of the rectangle (which is the distance between the $y$-coordinates of the vertices), and $w$ is the width of the rectangle (which is the distance between the $x$-coordinates of the vertices).\nThe distance between the $y$-coordinates of the vertices is $3-0=3$, and the distance between the $x$-coordinates of the vertices is $3-0=3$. Therefore, $h=1$ and $w=3$.\nThe area of the rectangle below the line is therefore:\n$A_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1}{2}$\nThe total area of the rectangle is:\n$A_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1}{2}$\nTherefore, the probability that $x < y$ is:\n$P(x < y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nSo the answer is (D) $\\frac{1}{4}$.",
