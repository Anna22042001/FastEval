Feinberg argues that most arguments for psychological egoism are nonempirical in character, meaning that they do not rely on empirical evidence or data from scientific studies. Instead, these arguments are often based on philosophical reasoning or personal experience. \n(E) (answer: Psychological egoism is the view that all mental states and behaviors are caused by the individual's own desires and beliefs, and that there is no role for external factors such as genetics or environmental influences.)",

This is because, in his view, morality is based on the natural laws and principles that govern human behavior. Anything that goes against these laws and principles is considered immoral, while anything that conforms to them is considered moral. Therefore, according to Cicero, immorality is in conflict with nature, while expediency is a more practical and pragmatic approach that may sometimes require actions that go against natural laws and principles.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": According to Immanuel Kant, the supreme principle of morality is (C) synthetic and a priori. This means that morality is based on the idea that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of whether they are based on experience or not. This principle is in contrast to the other options, which suggest that morality is based on either experience or a combination of experience and reason. Kant believed that morality should be based on a universal principle that is independent of personal experience or cultural background, and that this principle can be known a priori, or through reason alone.",

This is because a virtuous man would not seek to gain any sort of personal gain or recognition from the death of his loved ones. Instead, he would focus on honoring their memory and finding meaning in his own life. \n(B) moderate grief is a reasonable response for a virtuous man who has lost his wife and children. This is because he would feel a sense of loss and sadness at the death of his loved ones, but he would also recognize that their deaths were not his fault and that they were not avoidable. \n(C) undisturbed is not a reasonable response for a virtuous man who has lost his wife and children. This is because he would likely feel a sense of loss and sadness at the death of his loved ones, and this would likely affect his ability to function in the world. \n(D) envy of those who still have their loved ones is not a reasonable response for a virtuous man who has lost his wife and children. This is because a virtuous man would not seek to gain any sort of personal gain or recognition from the death of his loved ones.

If the action is in violation of a moral rule, then it is not morally permissible and the individual must either change their action or justify it. If the action is not in violation of any moral rules, then it may still be subject to other moral considerations, such as whether it is just or fair, but it is not necessarily forbidden by any moral rules.",

In other words, felicity is not a state of constant pleasure or contentment, but rather a state of being free from the desire for anything, whether it be pleasure, power, or fame.
