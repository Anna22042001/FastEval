This estimate is based on the number of genes that have been identified in the human genome, as well as on the number of genes that are predicted to exist but have not yet been identified. However, it is important to note that this estimate may change over time as new technologies and methods are developed for gene identification.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a protein involved in the transport of salt and water across cell membranes. The most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis is a deletion, which involves the removal of a section of DNA. This deletion typically results in the production of a dysfunctional CFTR protein, which leads to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis, such as persistent lung infections and digestive problems. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) a deletion.",

            "model_answer": ": In genome-wide association studies, known SNPs explain less than 1% of the variation in body mass index despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies. This is because only a small proportion of the genome is actually sequenced in these studies, and most of the genetic variation in BMI is likely to be located in regions of the genome that are not yet covered by these studies. Therefore, known SNPs explain only a small portion of the genetic variation in BMI, and there is likely much more genetic variation in BMI that has yet to be discovered.",

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to an accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood. If left untreated, this can lead to intellectual disability and other severe health problems. \nThe risk of a child having PKU if the mother has untreated PKU is (D) almost 100%. This is because the mother's untreated PKU will be passed down to her child through her genes. The child will have the same genetic mutation as the mother and will therefore be at risk for PKU. \nI hope this explanation helps!",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. \nFirst, let's define what the inbreeding coefficient, F, is. It is a measure of the degree of relatedness between individuals in a population. It is calculated as the number of homozygotes divided by the total number of individuals in the population. \nNow, let's consider the answer choices. \n(A) Reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population: This is correct. When the inbreeding coefficient, F, is high, there are more homozygotes in the population, which means there are fewer heterozygotes. This can lead to a reduction in the overall genetic diversity of the population, which can have negative consequences such as increased susceptibility to diseases. \n(B) Higher proportion of genes that show linkage: This is correct. When the inbreeding coefficient, F, is high, there are more homozygotes in the population, which means that genes that are in close proximity on the chromosome are more likely to be inherited together. This can lead to increased linkage disequilibrium, which can make it more difficult to detect associations between genetic variants and traits. \n(C) Higher proportion of genes with introns: This is incorrect. In fact, the opposite is true. When the inbreeding coefficient, F, is high, there are more homozygotes in the population, which means that genes with exons (the coding regions of the DNA) are more likely to be inherited together. This can lead to a higher proportion of genes with exons in the population. \n(D) Higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: This is incorrect. The level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells is not affected by the inbreeding coefficient, F. \nTherefore, the answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",

Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. In \u03b1-thalassaemia, the mutation results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin molecules that are unable to transport oxygen effectively. \nThere are several types of \u03b1-thalassaemia, but the most common is \u03b1-thalassaemia minor, which is caused by a point mutation (D) in the \u03b1-globin gene. This mutation results in the substitution of a single nucleotide (adenine for guanine) at position 6 of the gene, which leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin molecules. \nIn summary, the common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a point mutation (D) in the \u03b1-globin gene.",
