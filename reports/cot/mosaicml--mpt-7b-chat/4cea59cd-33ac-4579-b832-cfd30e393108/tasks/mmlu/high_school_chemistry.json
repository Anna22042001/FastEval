            "model_answer": ":\n\nTo determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to use the formula for molecular mass, which is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule. \nFirst, we can calculate the molecular mass of carbon dioxide (CO2), which consists of one carbon atom (C) and two oxygen atoms (O). The atomic mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. Therefore, the molecular mass of CO2 is:\n\n(C + O) x (12.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol) = 30.01 g/mol\n\nNext, we can calculate the molecular mass of the compound in question, which we know consists of one carbon atom (C) and three oxygen atoms (O). The atomic mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. Therefore, the molecular mass of the compound is:\n\n(C + O) x (12.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol) x 3 = 72.03 g/mol\n\nSince the molecular mass of the compound is greater than the mass of the compound, we know that the compound must consist of more than one type of atom. Therefore, the empirical formula of the compound must be a ratio of the molecular masses of the compound, which is:\n\n(72.03 g/mol) / (C + O) = 18.02 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula of the compound is (C2O3), which consists of one carbon atom (C) and three oxygen atoms (O).",

The correct order of increasing acid strength is (D) H2SO3 < H2SeO3 < HClO < HBrO. \nTo determine the correct order, we need to look at the structure of the acids and how they behave in aqueous solution. Stronger acids have more acidic hydrogen ions (H+) in solution, which means they can dissolve more substances and have a lower pH. \nHydrogen sulfide (H2SeO3) is a weak acid, which means it has fewer acidic hydrogen ions in solution. Hydrogen peroxide (H2SO4) is also a weak acid, but it has more acidic hydrogen ions in solution than H2SeO3. Chloric acid (HClO3) is a strong acid, which means it has the most acidic hydrogen ions in solution.

To do this, we divide the mass of propane by its molar mass: \n6.2 g / 68.14 g/mol = 0.088 mol \nNext, we can use the formula for the number of moles: \nnumber of moles = mass in grams / molar mass \nPlugging in the values, we get: \nnumber of moles = 0.088 mol / 68.14 g/mol \nnumber of moles = 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol \nTherefore, the answer is (D) 1.4 \u00d7 10^-1 mol.",

The more massive a particle is, the more it weighs compared to its charge.\n\nThe most massive subatomic particle is the proton, which has a mass-to-charge ratio of 1.67 x 10^-27 kg/C.
