This suggests that the goal of the program is to end the person's life, which is known as euthanasia. Cryonics, Medicare, and Hospice are all related to end-of-life care, but do not involve ending someone's life.",

            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Avoid any discussion of the deceased is not the best option for helping a bereaved individual. This is because avoiding any discussion of the deceased can make the person feel like their loss is being ignored or minimized. It can also make them feel like they are not allowed to talk about their loved one, which can be very painful.\n(B) Remain in close contact is a better option than (A). This is because remaining in close contact can help the bereaved individual feel supported and not alone. It can also help them feel like they can turn to someone for comfort and advice.\n(C) Stay away and let the person grieve is a better option than (B). This is because staying away can help the bereaved individual feel like they have the space and time they need to process their grief. It can also help them feel like they are not a burden on others.\n(D) Change the home environment for the bereaved is not the best option. This is because changing the home environment can make the bereaved individual feel like they are trying to change their memories of their loved one. It can also make them feel like they are trying to forget their loved one, which can be very painful.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\nOlder workers are more likely to be absent from work due to health issues or retirement. They may also be less productive due to physical limitations or lack of motivation. Older workers may be more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs due to factors such as reduced job security or lack of opportunities for advancement. Finally, older workers may be more likely to be laid off due to age discrimination in the workplace.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Be laid off.",

This type of cemetery is also known as a \"green\" cemetery, as it emphasizes environmental sustainability and natural beauty. The term \"rapid decay\" refers to the process of decomposition that occurs quickly after death, which is not applicable to a natural cemetery.
