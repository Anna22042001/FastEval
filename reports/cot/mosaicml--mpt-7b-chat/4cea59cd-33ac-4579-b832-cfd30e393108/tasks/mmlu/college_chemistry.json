            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nExplanation: \nOptical isomerism is the phenomenon where a molecule can exist in two different forms, each with different optical properties. These forms are called enantiomers. In order for a molecule to display optical isomerism, it must have at least two different chiral centers. \nIn the case of complexes containing achiral ligands, there is only one chiral center, which is the metal atom. Therefore, the complex can only display optical isomerism if all ligands are identical, which is option (A). \nTetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism because they have only one plane of symmetry, which means that they cannot exist in two different forms. \nLinear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different because they have two different chiral centers. \nOctahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands because they have two different chiral centers.",

            "model_answer": ":\nThe number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide is (D) 4.\nExplanation:\nThe number of allowed energy levels for a nuclide is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. In the case of 55Mn, the number of protons is 55 and the number of neutrons is 25. Since the number of neutrons is greater than the number of protons, the nuclide is unstable and will decay over time. The number of allowed energy levels is determined by the stability of the nucleus, which is influenced by the balance between the number of protons and neutrons. In this case, since there are only 4 neutrons, there are only 4 possible energy levels for the nuclide.",

To determine the NMR frequency of 31P in a 20.0 T magnetic field, we need to use the following formula:\n\nf = B * (1/2\u03c0) * (1/n)\n\nwhere f is the NMR frequency, B is the magnetic field strength in T, and n is the nuclear spin of the atom in question.\n\nIn this case, n = 1 for 31P, so we can substitute this value into the formula and solve for f:\n\nf = 20.0 * (1/2\u03c0) * (1/1) = 20.0 * \u03c0 * 2\u03c0 = 20.0 * 2\u03c0 = 20.0 * 4.18 = 82.4 MHz\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 54.91 MHz.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ":\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the principle of relative intensities in spectroscopy. This principle states that the relative intensity of a spectral line is proportional to the square of the ratio of the concentrations of the two species that give rise to the line. \nIn this case, the two spectral lines have relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, respectively. We can use this information to set up a proportion:\n(\u03b1/1) = (3\u03b1/1)\nSimplifying this proportion, we get:\n\u03b1 = 3\u03b1\nNow we can use this information to find the ratio of the concentrations of DMSO and AN. We know that the total concentration of the mixture is 1 mol/L, so we can use this information to set up another proportion:\n(1/1) = (1/x) + (1/y)\nwhere x and y are the concentrations of DMSO and AN, respectively.\nSubstituting the value of \u03b1 from the previous proportion, we get:\n(1/1) = (1/x) + (1/y)\n(1/x) = 3(1/y)\nx = 3y\nNow we can find the ratio of the concentrations of DMSO and AN:\n(1/x) + (1/y) = (1/1)\n(1/x) = 1\nx = 1\nSubstituting this value of x into the previous proportion, we get:\n(1/1) = (1/1) + (1/y)\n(1/1) = 2(1/y)\ny = 3\nTherefore, the ratio of the concentrations of DMSO and AN is 1:3.",

This is because the oxidation state of aluminum decreases by three, while the oxidation state of sodium increases by three in the reaction. This indicates that the reaction is exothermic and favors the reduction of aluminum and the oxidation of sodium. The other reactions involve the transfer of electrons from more electronegative elements to less electronegative elements, which indicates that they are also exothermic and favor the reduction of the more electronegative element and the oxidation of the less electronegative element.
