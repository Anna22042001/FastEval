            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \n(A) Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle. \nStare decisis is a principle in which courts follow the precedents set by higher courts in similar cases. Appellate judges are bound by the precedents set by higher courts, just like lower courts. Therefore, it is not possible for appellate judges to never use the stare decisis principle. \n(B) Appellate trials are usually jury trials. \nAppellate trials are not usually jury trials. In fact, most appellate trials are decided by judges rather than juries. \n(C) Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case. \nThis statement is not entirely true. While it is true that some appellate judges will decide the facts of a case, it is not the norm. Most appellate judges will review the lower court's decision and determine whether it was correct based on the law. \n(D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts. \nThis statement is also not entirely true. While it is true that appellate judges will review lower court decisions, they will not always review them. Appellate judges will only review lower court decisions if there is an error or if the lower court's decision conflicts with the law.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is (D) Cabinet. \nExplanation: \nThe Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248 are both related to government reorganization and staff selection. However, the question does not specify which staff the president is selecting for, so we cannot determine the answer from that information alone. \nBased on the context of the question, we can infer that the president is selecting staff for a government agency or department. The only option that fits this description is the Cabinet, which is the group of top-level executive branch officials who make up the president's \"Cabinet\" and advise him or her on policy matters. \nTherefore, the answer is (D) Cabinet.",

The primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was over whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \nFiscal federalism is the principle that is realized when the federal government provides most of the funding to a project in which multiple levels of government work together. This means that the federal government has a greater say in the allocation of funds and the management of the project, while the state and local governments have a smaller role. This principle is different from confederation, which involves the complete separation of powers between the federal government and the states, and grant-based funding, which involves the federal government providing funds to state and local governments on a project-by-project basis. Dual federalism, on the other hand, involves the co-equal status of the federal government and the states, with both levels of government having a say in the allocation of funds and the management of projects. Therefore, the answer is (B) Fiscal federalism.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \n\n(A) is not true. The Supreme Court does not hear every case that is appealed to it. Only a small percentage of cases are heard by the Supreme Court. The court has the power to choose which cases to hear, and it does not have to hear every case that is appealed to it.\n\n(B) is true. The Supreme Court can help set the public agenda by deciding which appeals to hear. The court can choose to hear cases that are important to the public, or that have significant implications for the law. This can help shape public opinion and influence policy decisions.\n\n(C) is true. The Supreme Court hears some cases when two or more justices agree that the case has merit. This is known as the \"supermajority\" requirement. The court must have at least five justices in agreement in order to hear a case. This ensures that the court only hears cases that are important and have significant legal implications.\n\n(D) is false. The chief justice's vote does not count as two votes. The chief justice's vote counts as one vote, just like the votes of the other justices. The chief justice does have a special role in the court, however, as the head of the court and the person who presides over most of the hearings.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": The No Child Left Behind Act is an example of a federal mandate, which is a type of policy that requires states or localities to take a certain action or adopt a particular policy. This is different from a constitutional amendment, which is a change to the U.S. Constitution itself, or affirmative action, which is a policy that aims to increase the representation of historically marginalized groups in education or the workforce. Tort reform refers to policies aimed at limiting the liability of defendants in civil lawsuits, which is not related to education policy. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) federal mandate.",

The Senate has a greater influence on foreign policy and national defense, while the House has a greater influence on domestic policy. The Senate also has a longer term of service than the House. The significant difference between the Senate and the House is that the Senate has two senators from each state, while the House has representatives based on population.

            "model_answer": ": \n(A) peer pressure is the most likely reason why people join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong. This is because people often follow the social norms and values of their peers, and joining a political party can be seen as a way to align oneself with a particular group or community. Economic issues and religious beliefs may also play a role in people's decision to join a different political party, but they are less likely to be the sole reason for this decision. Pressure from employers may also be a factor, but it is less likely to be the primary reason why people join a different political party. Therefore, the answer is (A) peer pressure.",

            "model_answer": ": Thank you for the question. House members are more concerned about their committee assignments than are senators because the House of Representatives is a larger body with more committees, and committee assignments are a key way for members to gain influence and visibility within the House. In contrast, the Senate has fewer committees and committee assignments are less important there. Additionally, the Senate has a more formalized process for considering legislation, which makes committee assignments less important for overall legislative outcomes. Therefore, the answer is (D) the rules make it extremely difficult for representatives to influence legislation on the House floor.",
