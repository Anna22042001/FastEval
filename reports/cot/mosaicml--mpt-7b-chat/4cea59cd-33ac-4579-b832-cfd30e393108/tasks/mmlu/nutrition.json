            "question": "Bariatric surgery is used for obesity treatment but how much is the incidence of type 2 diabetes reduced in obese individuals after surgery?\n\n\n(A) 80-90%\n(B) No reduction in the incidence\n(C) Approximately 50 %\n(D) None of the options given is correct",

            "model_answer": ": Bariatric surgery is a type of surgical procedure that is used to treat obesity. It involves the removal of a portion of the stomach or the reconfiguration of the stomach to help individuals lose weight. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is reduced in obese individuals after surgery because obesity is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. The exact percentage of individuals who experience a reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery varies depending on the specific type of surgery and the individual's pre-surgery health status. Some studies have shown that the incidence of type 2 diabetes can be reduced by as much as 80-90% in obese individuals who undergo bariatric surgery. However, it is important to note that bariatric surgery is not a cure for obesity or type 2 diabetes, and individuals who undergo the procedure still need to make lifestyle changes to maintain their weight and manage their diabetes. Therefore, the answer is (B) No reduction in the incidence.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": ": \nThe correct statement is (A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because replacing saturated fatty acids with polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, has been shown to reduce plasma triglyceride concentrations. This is because polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to reduce the secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, which are associated with increased plasma triglyceride concentrations. On the other hand, replacing saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids or replacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol, as these types of dietary changes tend to increase total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations. Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol, as these types of dietary changes tend to increase total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": Uric acid is the main nitrogenous compound in urine. Uric acid is formed when purines, which are compounds found in foods such as meat, seafood, and beans, are broken down by the body. The kidneys filter out excess uric acid in the urine. The amount of uric acid in the urine can be measured to determine the level of kidney function. Ammonia, urea, and creatinine are also nitrogenous compounds found in urine, but they are not the main compound. Urea and creatinine are waste products of the body's metabolism, and they are filtered out by the kidneys. Ammonia is produced by the body as a byproduct of the breakdown of proteins, and it is also filtered out by the kidneys. Therefore, the answer is (A) Uric acid.",

            "model_answer": ": \n(A) The amount of oxygen available in the headspace of canned food is kept at a high level so as to limit losses of vitamin C. \nCanned foods are often stored in airtight containers to prevent the loss of oxygen, which can cause the vitamin C content to degrade. Vitamin C is sensitive to oxygen and can easily be oxidized, which reduces its effectiveness. Therefore, canned foods are often stored in a high-oxygen environment to limit vitamin C losses. \n(B) Reheating canned vegetables before serving only causes small losses of vitamin C. \nReheating canned vegetables does cause some loss of vitamin C, but the amount is generally small. This is because the high-temperature cooking process used in canning destroys many microorganisms that can degrade vitamin C. \n(C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables. \nCanned fruits generally have a higher vitamin C content than canned vegetables, and therefore, losses of vitamin C during storage are generally higher. However, the amount of vitamin C loss can vary depending on the type of fruit and the storage conditions. \n(D) Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature tend to be small. \nCanned foods stored at ambient temperature generally have small losses of vitamin C. This is because the high-temperature cooking process used in canning destroys many microorganisms that can degrade vitamin C.

            "model_answer": ":\nEpigenetic changes are modifications to gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation is one type of epigenetic change that can occur, and it involves the addition of a methyl group to a specific nucleotide in the DNA sequence. This can lead to changes in gene expression, but it does not change the underlying DNA sequence itself. Modifying gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence is another type of epigenetic change that can occur. This can include changes in histone modification, non-coding RNA expression, and other mechanisms that alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. Enabling one genotype to result in different phenotypes is another type of epigenetic change that can occur. This can happen when certain genes are expressed in certain cells or under certain conditions, leading to different outcomes even though the underlying DNA sequence is the same.

            "model_answer": ": \nThe absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake is the most correct statement. This is because glucose absorption in the GI tract is facilitated by the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT), which is located at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. SGLT is responsible for transporting glucose across the membrane in exchange for sodium ions, which helps to maintain the electrochemical gradient necessary for the transport of glucose.
