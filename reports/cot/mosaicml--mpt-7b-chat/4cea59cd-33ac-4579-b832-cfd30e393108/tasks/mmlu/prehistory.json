            "model_answer": ":\nThank you for the question. The answer is (D) larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones. \nExplanation:\nThe Levallois technology is a type of stone tool manufacturing technology that was used by early hominins, such as Homo erectus and Homo sapiens. It involves the production of small, sharp stone flakes from a larger, duller stone. This technology was used to make a wide range of tools, including axes, spears, and knives.\nIn the Levallois technology, the larger, duller stone is struck against a hard surface to produce a small, sharp stone flake. This process is repeated many times to produce a large number of small, sharp stone flakes. The small, sharp stone flakes can then be used to make a wide range of tools, such as axes, spears, and knives.\nTherefore, the shift in emphasis from producing core tools to producing flakes is the correct answer.",

This is because primates are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom, and studying them can provide insights into human evolution, behavior, and cognition. While paleoanthropology focuses on the study of ancient humans through fossils and artifacts, archaeology focuses on the study of past human societies and cultures, and linguistics focuses on the study of human language and communication, none of these fields specifically aim to better understand the nearest living relatives of humans.",

Maize (also known as corn) is a domesticated plant that belongs to the grass family, and it is believed to have originated in southern Mexico. The wild progenitor of maize is teosinte, which is a small wild grass that is closely related to maize. Teosinte is believed to have evolved into maize around 10,000 years ago, and it is thought to have been a common plant in the region at the time. The other options listed in the question (einkorn, emmer, and legumes) are all other types of grains that are related to maize, but they are not its wild progenitor.

            "model_answer": ": \nTo answer this question, we need to look at a map of Teotihuac\u00e1n and identify the largest structure. The Pyramid of the Sun is the largest structure at Teotihuac\u00e1n, with a height of 68 meters. It was built around 600 AD and has six levels. \nTo determine the number of platform monuments and pyramids built at Teotihuac\u00e1n, we need to look at a list of the major structures at the site. The Pyramid of the Moon, Temple of the Feathered Serpent, and Temple of the Inscriptions are all major structures at Teotihuac\u00e1n, but they are not the largest structures. \nThe Pyramid of the Moon is the second-largest structure at Teotihuac\u00e1n, with a height of 52 meters. It was built around 100 AD and has five levels. \nThe Temple of the Feathered Serpent is the third-largest structure at Teotihuac\u00e1n, with a height of 45 meters. It was built around 100 AD and has four levels. \nThe Temple of the Inscriptions is the fourth-largest structure at Teotihuac\u00e1n, with a height of 40 meters. It was built around 100 AD and has three levels. \nTherefore, the answer is (D) Temple of the Inscriptions; 700.",

Archaeological evidence suggests that the first domesticated cattle were found in the Middle East, specifically in the Fertile Crescent region. This region is located in modern-day Iraq, Syria, and Jordan, and is known for its rich and diverse archaeological sites. The evidence suggests that domesticated cattle first appeared in this region around 10,500 years ago, which is about 3,500 years earlier than the other options listed.

This period of environmental change occurred between 13,200 and 12,800 years ago and is characterized by a sudden and severe cooling of the Earth's climate. This cooling caused a number of environmental changes, including the melting of glaciers and the expansion of permafrost, which in turn caused a number of environmental changes that affected humans. In particular, the sudden and severe cooling caused many humans to abandon their homes in northern Europe, leading to a temporary population decline in this region.",
