            "question": "What is the enlightened self-interest model of CSR?\n\n(A) That it is in an organization's own best interest to put itself first rather than its ethics\n(B) That it is in an organization's best interest to consider what a shareholder would want\n(C) That it is in an organization's own best interest to act in an ethical way\n(D) That it is in an organization's own best interest to follow the legislation and abide by the law",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": The answer is (D) That it is in an organization's own best interest to follow the legislation and abide by the law. The enlightened self-interest model of CSR suggests that an organization should act in an ethical way because it is in its own best interest to do so. This means that an organization should consider the interests of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the community, in addition to shareholders. By acting in an ethical way, an organization can build a positive reputation, attract customers and employees, and avoid negative consequences such as legal penalties or loss of business. Therefore, following the legislation and abiding by the law is an important aspect of the enlightened self-interest model of CSR.",

            "question": "There are two main issues associated with _____ sizing. _______ is a key issue as due to the information policy of the corporation it can be argued that employees have a right to know if they are being made redundant. _______ is a second issue, particularly the ________ package that employees receive when laid off.\n\n(A) Down, Involvement, Remuneration, Compensation\n(B) Up, Involvement, Autonomy, Compensation\n(C) Down, Autonomy, Remuneration, Benefit\n(D) Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": ": The correct answer is (D) Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit. \nExplanation: The two main issues associated with employee sizing are redundancy and the severance package that employees receive when laid off. The correct answer is (D) Up, Independence, Involvement, Benefit, which refers to the level of independence, involvement, and benefit that employees receive during the sizing process. This means that the level of independence and involvement of employees in the decision-making process is important, as well as the benefit or compensation that they receive as a result of the sizing process. The other options listed in the question do not adequately address these two key issues.",

The only category that fits this description is environmental regulation, which concerns the mechanics of such processes. \nLegal regulation deals with the interactions between CSOs and businesses, but does not necessarily concern the mechanics of the processes. Civil regulation deals with the outcomes of these interactions, but does not address the mechanics of the processes. Political regulation also deals with outcomes, but does not address the mechanics of the processes. \nTherefore, the answer is (D) Environmental, Relations, Mechanics.",

            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is (D) Top, Standardisation, Political, Economic. \nExplanation: \nThe question asks for the \"race to the bottom\" which refers to a situation where countries compete with each other to have lower standards or regulations in order to attract foreign investment. This is often driven by globalisation, which refers to the increasing interconnectedness of the world's economies. \nThe answer cannot be (A) because the term \"bottom\" refers to the lowest standards or regulations, which is not what is being described in the question. \nThe answer cannot be (B) because the term \"top\" refers to the highest standards or regulations, which is not what is being described in the question. \nThe answer cannot be (C) because the terms \"standardisation\" and \"economic\" are not related to the concept of \"race to the bottom\". \nTherefore, the only remaining option is (D) which describes a situation where countries compete with each other to have lower standards or regulations in order to attract foreign investment, which is driven by globalisation and political factors.",

However, the answer to the question is (D) Legislation, specifically the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States. This legislation was enacted in 2002 in response to several high-profile corporate scandals, including Enron and WorldCom, and it established strict accounting and financial reporting requirements for publicly traded companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was designed to increase transparency and accountability in corporate financial reporting, and it has been a key factor in promoting ethical business practices by requiring companies to be more transparent and honest in their financial dealings.",

Individual factors are related to the unique characteristics of a person, such as their values, beliefs, and personality traits. Situational factors, on the other hand, are features of the person's environment or the particular issue at hand. The correct answer is (C) Situational, Tailored. This is because tailored and individual factors are more specific to a particular person, while situational factors are more general and applicable to a wider range of situations. Therefore, situational factors can be tailored to a particular situation, making them more relevant to ethical decision making.",
