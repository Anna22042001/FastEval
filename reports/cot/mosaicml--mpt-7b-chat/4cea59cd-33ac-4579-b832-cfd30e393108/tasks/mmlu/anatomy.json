            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is (D) palatine, frontonasal, secondary nasal processes and mandibular processes. \nThe palatine processes, which are the upper jaw bones, fuse together during development to form the hard palate, which is the roof of the mouth. In a complete bilateral cleft palate, this fusion is incomplete or absent, resulting in a gap or split in the hard palate. This condition can cause difficulty with eating, speech, and breathing, and may also increase the risk of other health problems such as ear infections and sinusitis.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": During quiet inspiration, the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles are normally active. The diaphragm is the primary muscle responsible for breathing, and it moves downwards to create a vacuum effect that draws air into the lungs. The external intercostal muscles, located along the sides of the ribcage, help to expand the lungs by pulling the ribs apart. Together, these two muscles allow for a full and efficient inhalation of air.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": ": \nThe answer is (D) The muscles of mastication, anterior and posterior bellies of digastric and geniohyoid. \nThe first brachial arch gives rise to the muscles of the neck and the muscles of mastication. The muscles of mastication include the masseter, temporalis, and buccinator muscles. The geniohyoid muscle is also derived from the first brachial arch. The other option, the muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric, is incorrect because the anterior belly of digastric is derived from the second brachial arch, not the first brachial arch. The other options are also incorrect because they include additional muscles that are not derived from the first brachial arch.",

            "model_answer": ": \nTo determine the correct answer, we need to consider the definition of each term and how it relates to the motion described in the question. \nAbduction refers to the motion of moving something away from the midline of the body, such as when reaching for an object on the opposite side of the body. \nEversion refers to the motion of moving something away from the body, such as when turning the hand palm-down. \nFlexion refers to the motion of moving something toward the body, such as when bending the elbow to pick up an object. \nPronation refers to the motion of moving something toward the body, such as when bending the wrist to grasp an object. \nBased on the motion described in the question, which involves bending the forearm toward the body, the correct answer is (C) Flexion.",

The spermatozoon, also known as the male gamete, enters the ovary through the fallopian tube and fuses with the ovum, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote then develops into a fetus during pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Ovary.",

            "model_answer": ": \n(A) light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingival junction is the correct answer. The mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth should be light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingival junction, which is the junction between the gingiva and the mucosa. This is because the gingiva and the mucosa are both part of the oral mucosa, and they both have a similar colour and texture. The colour of the mucosa can vary depending on factors such as age, health, and exposure to certain substances, but in a healthy patient, the mucosa should be light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingival junction.",

It is a primary growth cartilage, meaning it is present at birth and develops during the first few years of life. The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is important for the development of the skull and the attachment of various muscles and nerves. It ceases activity at around 7 years of age, but can be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly, a condition in which the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone.
