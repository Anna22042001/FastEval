            "model_answer": ":\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the formula for mechanical energy of a spring-mass system, which is:\n\nE = 0.5 * k * x^2\n\nwhere E is the mechanical energy, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the value of k. Since the spring is massless, we can assume that k = 0.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position. Since the mass is released from rest, its initial velocity is zero. Therefore, its displacement from equilibrium is simply the distance it moves, which is 0.030 m.\n\nNow we can plug in the values and solve for E:\n\nE = 0.5 * 0 * 0.030^2 = 0.24 mJ\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 0.24 mJ.",

When it hits the surface of the puddle, some of the light is refracted or bent towards the normal (upward) due to the difference in indices of refraction between the water and the oil. The amount of bending depends on the wavelength of the light.\n\nThe most strongly reflected wavelength is the one for which the amount of bending is maximum. This is because the light is completely reflected when it hits the surface of the oil, and the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are equal.\n\nThe angle of incidence is the angle between the incoming light and the normal, which is 45 degrees in this case. The angle of reflection is also 45 degrees, since the surface of the oil is flat.\n\nThe amount of bending is given by the formula:\n\nn1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2)\n\nwhere n1 is the index of refraction of the water, n2 is the index of refraction of the oil, theta1 is the angle of incidence, and theta2 is the angle of reflection.\n\nFor the 500 nm wavelength, theta1 = 45 degrees, n1 = 1.33, n2 = 1.5, and sin(theta2) = 0.5.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n(1.33 * sin(45)) * 0.5 = 0.835\n\nTherefore, the most strongly reflected wavelength is the one for which sin(theta2) is maximum, which is the 500 nm wavelength.\n\n(A) 500 nm",
