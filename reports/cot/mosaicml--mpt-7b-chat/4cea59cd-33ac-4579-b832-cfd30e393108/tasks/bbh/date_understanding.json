We can do this by subtracting 1 from the year of marriage, which gives us Jan 1, 1959. \nNow we can use the format MM/DD/YYYY to write down the date of their anniversary. Since Jan 1, 1959 is not a valid date in the format MM/DD/YYYY, we need to convert it to a valid date. \nTo do this, we can add 1900 to the year to get the year in the format we need.

This means that today is the day before the concert date. We can use this information to determine the date 24 hours later. \nFirst, we need to convert the concert date from 06/01/1943 to a date format that we can use in our calculations. We can do this by subtracting one from the month and day, and adding the day of the month to the year. This gives us a date of 05/31/1943. \nNext, we need to add 24 hours to this date to get the date 24 hours later.
