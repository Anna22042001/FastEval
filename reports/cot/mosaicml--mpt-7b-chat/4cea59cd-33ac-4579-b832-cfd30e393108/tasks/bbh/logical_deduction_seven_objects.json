Similarly, Eve cannot be Ana, since Ana finished third-to-last. This leaves Eve as either Joe or Dan. \nNext, we know that Dan finished second. This means that Dan cannot be Eve or Ana, since Eve finished above Amy and Ana finished third-to-last. This leaves Dan as either Mel or Ada. \nNow we know that Eve is either Joe or Dan, and Dan is either Mel or Ada. We also know that Ana finished third-to-last, which means that Ana cannot be Eve or Dan. This leaves Ana as either Mel or Ada. \nFinally, we know that Amy finished third. This means that Amy cannot be Eve or Ana, since Eve finished above Amy and Ana finished third-to-last. This leaves Amy as either Joe or Dan. \nTherefore, the only possible solution is (D) Dan finished fourth.",
