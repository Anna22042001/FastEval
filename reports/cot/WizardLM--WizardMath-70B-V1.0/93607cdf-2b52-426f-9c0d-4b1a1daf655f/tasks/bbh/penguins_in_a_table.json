We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.\nHow many penguins are more than 5 years old?\nOptions:\n(A) 1\n(B) 2\n(C) 3\n(D) 4\n(E) 5",
            "correct_answer": "(C)",
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the penguins more than 5 years old.\nWe need to find the penguins with an age greater than 5 years old. To do this, we will look at the age column in the table and compare each penguin's age to 5.\n\nStep 2: Compare the ages of the penguins to 5.\n- Louis: 7 years old (greater than 5)\n- Bernard: 5 years old (not greater than 5)\n- Vincent: 9 years old (greater than 5)\n- Gwen: 8 years old (greater than 5)\n\nStep 3: Count the number of penguins more than 5 years old.\nWe found that Louis, Vincent, and Gwen are more than 5 years old. Since we are looking for the number of penguins that meet this criteria, we can count the number of penguins we identified in step 2.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer.\nThere are 3 penguins more than 5 years old: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.\n\nThe answer is: 3.",
