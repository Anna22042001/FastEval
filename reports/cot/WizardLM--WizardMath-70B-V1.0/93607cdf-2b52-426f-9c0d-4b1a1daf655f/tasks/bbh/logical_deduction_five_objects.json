Rob finished above Mya.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\nWe know that Eve finished first, so we can eliminate option (A) since it states that Eve finished second-to-last.\n\nStep 3: Determine the order of the remaining golfers\nNow, we need to find the order of the remaining golfers: Eli, Joe, Rob, and Mya.\n\nStep 4: Use the given information to establish the order\nWe know that Joe finished above Eli and below Mya. This means that Joe's position is between Eli and Mya. Since Rob finished above Mya, we can conclude that Rob's position is between Joe and Mya.\n\nStep 5: Arrange the golfers in the order of their finish\nBased on the information we have, we can arrange the golfers in the order of their finish as follows:\n1. Eve\n2. Joe\n3. Rob\n4. Mya\n5. Eli\n\nStep 6: Identify the golfer who finished second-to-last\nFrom the order of finish, we can see that Eli finished second-to-last.\n\nStep 7: Provide the final answer\nThe golfer who finished second-to-last is Eli.

Joe finished above Eve.\n4. Eve finished above Dan.\n\nStep 2: Identify the possible positions for each golfer\nWe can represent the possible positions for each golfer using numbers, where 1 is the first position (winner) and 5 is the last position (loser).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the possible positions for each golfer\n\n1. Rob: Since Rob finished below Dan, Rob cannot be in position 1. If Rob is in position 2, then Dan would be in position 3, which contradicts the information that Dan finished below Rob. Therefore, Rob must be in position 5 (last).\n\n2. Amy: Amy can be in any position except for the last position (5) since Rob is already in that position.\n\n3. Joe: Joe finished second, so he is in position 2.\n\n4. Eve: Eve finished above Dan, so she cannot be in position 5. Since Joe is in position 2, Eve must be in position 3.\n\n5. Dan: Dan finished below Rob, so he cannot be in position 1. Since Eve is in position 3, Dan must be in position 4.\n\nStep 4: Determine the final positions for each golfer\nBased on our analysis, the final positions for each golfer are:\n1. Amy\n2. Joe\n3. Eve\n4. Dan\n5. Rob\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nThe golfer who finished last is Rob. The answer is (E) Dan finished last.\n\nThe answer is: E.",

So, we can fill in the third position with the crow:\nQuail - X - Crow - X - X\n\nStep 3: Place the robin.\nThe crow is to the right of the robin, which means the robin is either in the first or second position. Since the crow is the third from the left, the robin must be in the second position:\nQuail - Robin - Crow - X - X\n\nStep 4: Place the owl.\nThe hummingbird is to the right of the owl, which means the owl is either in the first, second, or third position. Since the crow is the third from the left, the owl must be in the first position:\nOwl - Robin - Crow - X - X\n\nStep 5: Place the hummingbird.\nNow, we have the owl in the first position and the hummingbird is to the right of the owl.
