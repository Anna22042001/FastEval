Also, the minivan being the second-newest implies that there is another vehicle that is newer than the minivan.\n\nStep 3: Determine the order of newness.\nWe have three vehicles: motorcycle, minivan, and tractor. We know that the tractor is newer than the minivan, and the minivan is the second-newest. This means that the motorcycle must be the newest vehicle, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer.\nBased on our analysis, we can conclude that the motorcycle is the newest vehicle.

Amy finished above Ada.\n\nStep 2: Understand the possible positions\nThere are three possible positions for each golfer: first, second, or third.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the first statement\nJoe finished below Ada. This means that Joe's position is either second or third, and Ada's position is either first or second.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the second statement\nAmy finished above Ada. This means that Amy's position is either first or third, and Ada's position is either second or third.\n\nStep 5: Combine the information\nNow, we need to combine the information from both statements. We know that Joe's position is either second or third, and Amy's position is either first or third. If Amy finished first, then Joe would have to finish third, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, Amy cannot finish first.\n\nStep 6: Determine the possible positions for Amy\nSince Amy cannot finish first, her only remaining option is to finish third. This means that Ada must finish second, as she cannot finish first (due to the first statement) and cannot finish third (due to the second statement).\n\nStep 7: Determine the possible positions for Joe\nNow that we know Amy finished third and Ada finished second, Joe's only remaining option is to finish first.\n\nStep 8: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the correct order of finish is: Joe (first), Ada (second), and Amy (third).
