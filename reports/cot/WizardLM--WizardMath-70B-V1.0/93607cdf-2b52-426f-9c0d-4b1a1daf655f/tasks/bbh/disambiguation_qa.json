It must be connected to an independent clause, which in this case is \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine the subject of the independent clause.\nThe subject of the independent clause \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter\" is \"the designer.\" This is the person who is performing the action of collaborating with the carpenter.\n\nStep 5: Determine the subject of the dependent clause.\nSince the dependent clause \"gave them a blueprint\" is connected to the independent clause \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter,\" the subject of the dependent clause is also \"the designer.\" This means that the designer is the one who gave the blueprint to the carpenter.\n\nStep 6: Identify the correct option.\nBased on the analysis of the sentence structure and the subjects of the independent and dependent clauses, we can conclude that the pronoun \"them\" refers to the carpenter. Therefore, the correct option is (B) Gave the carpenter a blueprint.\n\nFinal Answer: The pronoun \"them\" in the sentence \"The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint\" refers to the carpenter.
