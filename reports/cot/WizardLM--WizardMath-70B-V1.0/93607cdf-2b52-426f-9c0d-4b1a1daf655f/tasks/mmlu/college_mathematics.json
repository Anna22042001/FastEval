However, since P is a projection transformation, its image is always a proper subspace of V. Therefore, P cannot be invertible, and statement I is false.\n\nStep 3: Analyze statement II (P is diagonalizable)\nTo determine if P is diagonalizable, we need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since P^2 = P, we know that 1 is an eigenvalue of P. Let v be an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 1, i.e., P(v) = v. Then, for any vector x in V, we can write x as a linear combination of v and its orthogonal complement (v^perp): x = a*v + b*v^perp, where a and b are scalars.\n\nNow, let's apply P to x:\nP(x) = P(a*v + b*v^perp) = a*P(v) + b*P(v^perp) = a*v + b*0 = a*v.\n\nThis shows that P acts as a scalar transformation on the subspace spanned by v, and it acts as the zero transformation on the orthogonal complement of this subspace.

Since K is compact, it is both closed and bounded. Now, let f be a continuous real-valued function defined on K. Since K is bounded, there exists some M > 0 such that for all x in K, the absolute value of f(x) is less than or equal to M. This means that the function f is bounded on the compact set K. Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nStatement II: If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\n\nTo prove this statement, let's assume that every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded. We want to show that K is compact. Since K is nonempty, there exists at least one point x in K. Now, let's consider the function f(x) = d(x, K), where d(x, K) is the distance from x to the set K. This function is continuous, and since every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, there exists some L > 0 such that for all x in K, the absolute value of f(x) is less than or equal to L. This implies that K is bounded.\n\nSince K is nonempty and bounded, by the Heine-Borel theorem, K is compact. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\nStatement III: If K is compact, then K is connected.\n\nTo prove this statement, let's assume that K is compact. We want to show that K is connected. To do this, we will use proof by contradiction. Suppose K is not connected, which means there exist nonempty open sets A and B such that K = A \u222a B, and A \u2229 B = \u2205. Since A and B are open, for each x in A and each y in B, there exist \u03b5_x > 0 and \u03b5_y > 0 such that the open balls B(x, \u03b5_x) and B(y, \u03b5_y) are contained in A and B, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the function f(x) = d(x, A \u2229 B). This function is continuous, and since every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, there exists some M > 0 such that for all x in K, the absolute value of f(x) is less than or equal to M. However, this contradicts the fact that K is the union of two nonempty disjoint open sets, as the distance between any point in A and any point in B would be greater than 0. Therefore, our assumption that K is not connected must be false, and K must be connected. Thus, statement III is true.\n\nIn conclusion, all three statements (I, II, and III) are true. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) I and II only.\n\nThe answer is: our assumption that K is not connected must be false, and K must be connected.
