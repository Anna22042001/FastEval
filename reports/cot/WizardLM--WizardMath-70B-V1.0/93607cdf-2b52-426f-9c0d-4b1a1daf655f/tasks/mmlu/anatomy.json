            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are asked to identify the cause of complete bilateral cleft palate. The possible causes are related to the fusion of different processes during embryonic development.\n\nStep 2: Identify the processes involved in palate formation\nThe palate is formed by the fusion of several processes, including the palatine, frontonasal, and secondary nasal processes.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the given options\nWe have four options to choose from:\n\n(A) palatine processes\n(B) palatine and frontonasal processes\n(C) palatine, frontonasal and secondary nasal processes\n(D) palatine, frontonasal, secondary nasal processes and mandibular processes\n\nStep 4: Determine the correct option\nTo find the correct option, we need to identify the processes that are involved in the formation of the palate. Since the palate is formed by the fusion of the palatine, frontonasal, and secondary nasal processes, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) as they only mention two of these processes.\n\nNow, we are left with options (C) and (D). Option (C) mentions all three processes involved in palate formation, while option (D) includes an additional process, the mandibular process, which is not involved in palate formation.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the correct option is (C) as it includes all the processes involved in palate formation. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nComplete bilateral cleft palate is due to failure of fusion of the palatine, frontonasal, and secondary nasal processes.\n\nThe answer is: (C).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the process of quiet inspiration\nQuiet inspiration is the process of inhaling air without any conscious effort or change in posture. It is a passive process that occurs when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract and expand the chest cavity.\n\nStep 2: Identify the muscles involved in quiet inspiration\nThere are three main muscle groups involved in quiet inspiration: the external intercostal muscles, the internal intercostal muscles, and the diaphragm.\n\nStep 3: Determine the role of each muscle group\n- External intercostal muscles: These muscles are located between the ribs and help to expand the chest cavity by lifting the ribs upwards and outwards.\n- Internal intercostal muscles: These muscles are located between the ribs and help to compress the chest cavity by pulling the ribs downwards and inwards.\n- Diaphragm: This is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. It contracts and flattens during inspiration, which increases the volume of the chest cavity.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the given answer options\nNow that we know the muscles involved in quiet inspiration, let's compare them to the given answer options:\n\n(A) External and internal intercostal muscles: This option only mentions the intercostal muscles and does not include the diaphragm, which is also active during quiet inspiration.\n\n(B) External intercostal muscles and diaphragm: This option includes the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm, but it does not mention the internal intercostal muscles, which are also active during quiet inspiration.\n\n(C) Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm: This option includes the internal intercostal muscles and the diaphragm, but it does not mention the external intercostal muscles, which are also active during quiet inspiration.\n\n(D) External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm: This option includes all three muscle groups (external intercostal muscles, internal intercostal muscles, and the diaphragm), which are active during quiet inspiration.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is (D) External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm.

            "model_answer": "To determine which muscles are derived from the first brachial arch, we need to understand the embryological development of the muscles in the head and neck region. The first brachial arch is a structure that forms during embryonic development and gives rise to several muscles in the head and neck.\n\nThe muscles of mastication, which include the temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoids, are derived from the first brachial arch. These muscles are involved in the chewing process and are innervated by the trigeminal nerve (CN V).\n\nThe anterior belly of the digastric muscle is also derived from the first brachial arch. The digastric muscle has two bellies, anterior and posterior, and only the anterior belly is derived from the first brachial arch. The digastric muscle is involved in the movement of the jaw and is innervated by the mylohyoid nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V).\n\nThe posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the geniohyoid muscle are not derived from the first brachial arch. The posterior belly of the digastric muscle is derived from the second brachial arch, and the geniohyoid muscle is derived from the hyoid arch.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) The muscles of mastication and anterior and posterior bellies of digastric\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the posterior belly of the digastric muscle is not derived from the first brachial arch, so the rewritten answer would be:\n\n(B) The muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric\n\nThe answer is: the correct answer is:\n(B) The muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric.",

Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement C: The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is a growth plate that is active during childhood and adolescence. It typically fuses around the age of 16-18 years, not 7 years.
