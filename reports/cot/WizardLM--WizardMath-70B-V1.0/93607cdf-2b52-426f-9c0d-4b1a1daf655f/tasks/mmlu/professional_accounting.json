            "model_answer": "To determine which segments require separate disclosure, we need to calculate the percentage of total revenue and total profit for each segment. We will then compare these percentages to the thresholds set by the accounting standards.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the percentage of total revenue for each segment:\nSegment A: 42 / 177 = 23.73%\nSegment B: 121 / 177 = 68.31%\nSegment C: 14 / 177 = 8.02%\n\nStep 2: Calculate the percentage of total profit for each segment:\nSegment A: 12 / 74 = 16.22%\nSegment B: 65 / 74 = 87.84%\nSegment C: (3) / 74 = -4.05%\n\nStep 3: Compare the percentages to the thresholds:\n- Revenue: 10% or more\n- Profit: 10% or more (or a loss of 20% or more)\n\nSegment A:\n- Revenue: 23.73% (more than 10%)\n- Profit: 16.22% (more than 10%)\n\nSegment B:\n- Revenue: 68.31% (more than 10%)\n- Profit: 87.84% (more than 10%)\n\nSegment C:\n- Revenue: 8.02% (less than 10%)\n- Profit: -4.05% (less than 20%)\n\nStep 4: Determine which segments require separate disclosure:\nBased on the calculations above, both Segment A and Segment B meet the thresholds for separate disclosure, as they both contribute more than 10% of total revenue and total profit. Segment C does not meet the thresholds for separate disclosure.\n\nTherefore, the segments required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements are A and B.

It involves assessing the client's business, financial situation, and reputation. This process is crucial for a CPA firm to ensure that it is not taking on any unnecessary risks or liabilities. Therefore, it is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice.\n\n(B) Professional skepticism of management: This option refers to the attitude of a CPA firm's auditors towards the management of the client company. Auditors must maintain a healthy skepticism towards the information provided by the management, as it may not always be accurate or complete. This skepticism helps auditors to identify potential risks and errors in the financial statements. Therefore, it is an element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice.\n\n(C) Computer information processing: This option refers to the use of computers and software to process and analyze financial data.

The agreement calls for an interest rate of 10% on fund used, a 15% compensating balance, and a commitment fee of 1% on the unused amount of the credit line.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Calculate the compensating balance\nThe agreement requires a 15% compensating balance, which means the company must maintain a balance of 15% of the credit line in a non-interest-bearing account at the bank. The credit line is $500,000, so the compensating balance is 15% * $500,000 = $75,000.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the unused amount of the credit line\nThe company borrows $200,000, so the unused amount of the credit line is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the commitment fee\nThe agreement calls for a 1% commitment fee on the unused amount of the credit line. So, the commitment fee is 1% * $300,000 = $3,000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the effective annual interest cost\nThe company borrows $200,000 for one year at an interest rate of 10%. The interest cost is $200,000 * 10% = $20,000. Adding the commitment fee to the interest cost, we get the total cost of borrowing: $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the effective annual interest rate\nTo find the effective annual interest rate, we need to divide the total cost of borrowing by the amount borrowed and then multiply by the number of years the loan is outstanding. In this case, the loan is outstanding for one year. So, the effective annual interest rate is $23,000 / $200,000 * 1 = 11.5%.\n\nThe answer is: 11.5%.\n\nThe answer is: 11.5\\%.",

To calculate the gain, subtract the adjusted basis from the fair market value:\n\nGain = Fair Market Value - Adjusted Basis\nGain = $50,000 - $16,000\nGain = $34,000\n\nStep 3: Calculate Strom's basis in Ace.\nStrom's basis in Ace is the sum of the adjusted basis of the land and the amount of gain or loss on the transfer of the land.

We have four options to choose from: conversion of the preferred stock into common stock, voting rights, dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid, and guaranteed dividends.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options\nNow, let's analyze each option to determine which one is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A): Conversion of the preferred stock into common stock\nConversion of preferred stock into common stock is not a universal right for holders of cumulative preferred stock. This right depends on the specific terms of the preferred stock and may not be available for all cumulative preferred stocks.\n\nOption (B): Voting rights\nVoting rights are typically associated with common stock, not preferred stock. While some preferred stocks may have voting rights, this is not a universal right for holders of cumulative preferred stock.\n\nOption (C): Dividend carryovers from years in which dividends were not paid\nCumulative preferred stockholders have the right to receive dividends that were not paid in previous years. This is a key feature of cumulative preferred stock, as it ensures that preferred stockholders will eventually receive their dividends, even if the company experiences financial difficulties in a given year.\n\nOption (D): Guaranteed dividends\nGuaranteed dividends are a characteristic of preferred stock in general, not just cumulative preferred stock. However, this does not mean that the dividends are always paid on time or in full. The company may still face financial difficulties that prevent it from paying dividends as scheduled.\n\nStep 3: Identify the correct answer\nBased on our analysis, the right that a holder of a public corporation's cumulative preferred stock is always entitled to is the right to receive dividends that were not paid in previous years (Option C). This is a unique feature of cumulative preferred stock that distinguishes it from other types of preferred stock and common stock.\n\nFinal Answer: The right that a holder of a public corporation's cumulative preferred stock is always entitled to is the right to receive dividends that were not paid in previous years (Option C).\n\nThe answer is: (C).",
