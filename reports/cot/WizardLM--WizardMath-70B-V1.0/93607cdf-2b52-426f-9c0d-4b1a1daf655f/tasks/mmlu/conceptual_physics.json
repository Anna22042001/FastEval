            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given four statements about general relativity and asked to determine which ones are true. We need to analyze each statement separately and provide a clear explanation for each one.\n\nStep 2: Analyze statement (A)\nThe first statement claims that light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity. According to general relativity, the speed of light is constant in a vacuum. However, the gravitational field of the Sun can cause light to travel in a curved path, which may give the appearance of slowing down. So, statement (A) is true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze statement (B)\nThe second statement claims that light passing the Sun is deflected. This is also true according to general relativity. The Sun's gravitational field can cause light to bend or deflect as it passes by, which is a well-known phenomenon called gravitational lensing.\n\nStep 4: Analyze statement (C)\nThe third statement claims that a clock on the Sun's surface runs faster than on Earth. This is a consequence of the time dilation effect in general relativity. The time dilation effect states that clocks in a stronger gravitational field (like on the Sun's surface) will appear to run slower compared to clocks in a weaker gravitational field (like on Earth). So, statement (C) is false.\n\nStep 5: Analyze statement (D)\nThe fourth statement claims that all of the above statements are true. We have already determined that statement (C) is false. Therefore, statement (D) is also false.\n\nStep 6: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the statements that are true according to general relativity are (A) and (B). The final answer is: (A) and (B).\n\nThe answer is: (A) and (B).",

However, it cannot be calibrated to read both at the same time, as they are two distinct quantities.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nA galvanometer can be calibrated to read either electric current (A) or voltage (B), but not both at the same time.

This means that mercury is 13.534 times heavier than water.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the height of the water column\nSince mercury is 13.534 times heavier than water, a water column will be 13.534 times taller than a mercury column to exert the same pressure at the base.\n\nStep 4: Compare the heights of the water and mercury columns\nNow, let's compare the heights of the water and mercury columns. The mercury column has a height of 1 cm, and the water column is 13.534 times taller.

The alpha particle has a mass of 4 amu (atomic mass units), while the neutron has a mass of 1 amu. The total mass of the hydrogen isotopes is also 4 amu.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the kinetic energy\nSince the total mass remains constant, the kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the neutron can be calculated using the formula:\n\nKinetic energy = (Total mass - Mass of alpha particle) * c^2\n\nHere, c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nStep 5: Compare the kinetic energies\nThe kinetic energy of the alpha particle is:\n\nK_alpha = (4 - 4) * c^2 = 0\n\nThe kinetic energy of the neutron is:\n\nK_neutron = (4 - 1) * c^2 = 3 * c^2\n\nStep 6: Calculate the gamma radiation energy\nThe energy released as gamma radiation is the difference between the total energy released in the reaction and the kinetic energies of the alpha particle and the neutron:\n\nE_gamma = Total energy - K_alpha - K_neutron\n\nSince the kinetic energy of the alpha particle is zero, we have:\n\nE_gamma = Total energy - 3 * c^2\n\nStep 7: Determine the dominant form of energy\nComparing the kinetic energies, we can see that the kinetic energy of the neutron is greater than the kinetic energy of the alpha particle. However, the gamma radiation energy is still significant and accounts for a large portion of the total energy released in the reaction.\n\nStep 8: Provide the final answer\nTherefore, the energy released in the fusion reaction is not dominated by any single form, and the answer is (D) All of these about equally.\n\nThe answer is: (D) All of these about equally.",
