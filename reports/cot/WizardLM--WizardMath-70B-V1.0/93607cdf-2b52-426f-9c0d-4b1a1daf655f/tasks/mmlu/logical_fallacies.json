Our task is to find the correct answer among the given options (A, B, C, and D).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given options\nWe need to understand what each option represents and how it relates to the question. Let's break down each option:\n\n(A) poisoning the well: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to discredit an opponent's argument by attacking their character or motives, rather than addressing the argument itself. It does not involve appealing to the people, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) suppressed evidence: This fallacy occurs when someone deliberately withholds evidence that would weaken their argument or strengthen their opponent's argument. It also does not involve appealing to the people, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) appeal to pride: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade others by appealing to their pride or vanity. It does not involve appealing to the people, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(D) appeal to the people: This fallacy occurs when someone tries to persuade others by appealing to the opinions or beliefs of the general public. It involves appealing to the people, which is the same as _Ad populum_, so it is the correct answer.\n\nStep 3: Provide the final answer\nThe correct answer is (D) appeal to the people. This fallacy is also known as _Ad populum_, which means \"to the people\" in Latin. It involves trying to persuade others by appealing to the opinions or beliefs of the general public.\n\nThe answer is: (D) appeal to the people.",

A syllogism is considered formally invalid if the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises, regardless of whether the premises are true or false.\n\nNow, let's break down the given answer:\n\n1. (A) cannot be materially true: This statement is incorrect because a syllogism can be both formally invalid and materially true. A syllogism is materially true if its premises are true and its conclusion follows from those premises. However, a syllogism can still be materially true even if it is formally invalid, meaning the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\n2. (B) might be materially true: This statement is correct. A syllogism that is formally invalid might still have true premises and a true conclusion. In this case, the syllogism would be materially true, but not formally valid.\n\n3. (C) might be materially untrue: This statement is also correct. A syllogism that is formally invalid might have false premises or a false conclusion, making it materially untrue.\n\n4. (D) both B and C: This statement is correct because a syllogism that is formally invalid can be either materially true or materially untrue. It is not necessarily one or the other.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (D) both B and C. A syllogism that is formally invalid can be either materially true or materially untrue.\n\nThe answer is: (D) both B and C.",
