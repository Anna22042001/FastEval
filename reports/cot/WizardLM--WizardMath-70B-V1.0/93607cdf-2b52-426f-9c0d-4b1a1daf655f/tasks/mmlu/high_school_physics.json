The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nII. The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nIII.

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand the motion of the whiffle ball. It is thrown straight up, reaches a highest point, and then falls back down. We are given three statements and we need to determine which of them are true.\n\n1. Statement I: The ball\u2019s speed is zero at the highest point.\nTo analyze this statement, we need to consider the forces acting on the ball. At the highest point, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which is acting downward. Since there is no other force acting upward, the ball's speed will be zero at the highest point. Therefore, Statement I is true.\n\n2. Statement II: The ball\u2019s acceleration is zero at the highest point.\nAcceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. At the highest point, the ball's velocity is zero (as we determined in Statement I). Since the ball is not moving, there is no change in velocity, and thus the acceleration is zero. Therefore, Statement II is also true.\n\n3. Statement III: The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nTo analyze this statement, we need to consider the forces acting on the ball during its ascent and descent. During the ascent, the ball is slowed down by air resistance, which opposes the force of gravity. This means that the ball will take longer to reach the highest point than it would without air resistance.\n\nDuring the descent, the ball is still affected by air resistance, but since it is falling with the force of gravity, the air resistance has less of an effect on the ball's speed. This means that the ball will fall faster than it rose. Therefore, the time taken to travel up is greater than the time taken to fall back down. Thus, Statement III is true.\n\nNow, let's summarize our findings:\n- Statement I: True\n- Statement II: True\n- Statement III: True\n\nSince all three statements are true, the final answer is (D) I & III only.\n\nThe answer is: (D) I & III only.",

Our goal is to find the radius of the circle that the electron beam will bend into when subjected to the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant formula\nThe formula to find the radius of a circle when an electron beam is bent by a magnetic field is:\n\nr = (v/B) * (1/2\u03c0)\n\nwhere r is the radius, v is the speed of the electron beam, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nStep 3: Plug in the given values\nWe are given v = 10^7 m/s and B = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 T.

We need to find the energy stored in the capacitor.\n\nStep 2: Recall the formula for energy stored in a capacitor\nThe formula for energy stored in a capacitor is:\n\nE = (1/2) * C * V^2\n\nwhere E is the energy stored, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nStep 3: Find the voltage across the capacitor\nWe are given the charge (Q) on each plate, but we need to find the voltage (V) to calculate the energy stored. We can use the formula:\n\nQ = C * V\n\nwhere Q is the charge and C is the capacitance.\n\nStep 4: Solve for the voltage\nWe have 6 millicoulombs of charge on each plate, so the total charge is:\n\nQ = 6 * 10^-3 C\n\nWe can now solve for the voltage:\n\nV = Q / C\nV = (6 * 10^-3 C) / 30 * 10^-6 F\nV = 200 V\n\nStep 5: Calculate the energy stored in the capacitor\nNow that we have the voltage, we can calculate the energy stored using the formula:\n\nE = (1/2) * C * V^2\nE = (1/2) * 30 * 10^-6 F * (200 V)^2\nE = (1/2) * 30 * 10^-6 F * 40000 V^2\nE = 60 * 10^-6 J\n\nStep 6: Write the final answer\nThe energy stored in the capacitor is most nearly 60 * 10^-6 J. Comparing this value with the given options, the answer is:\n\n(B) 9.0 \u00d7 10\u20138 J\n\nThe answer is: 9.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ J}.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a graph with net force on the vertical axis and acceleration on the horizontal axis. Our task is to find the quantity that can be directly measured using the slope of this graph.\n\nStep 2: Recall Newton's second law of motion\nNewton's second law of motion states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nF = m * a\n\nwhere F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the graph\nThe graph shows the relationship between net force (F) and acceleration (a). Since the slope of a graph represents the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change, we can write the slope of this graph as:\n\nSlope = (Change in F) / (Change in a)\n\nStep 4: Relate the slope to Newton's second law\nRecall that the slope of the graph is equal to the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. In terms of Newton's second law, this ratio represents the mass (m) of the object, which is the only factor that relates the net force (F) to the acceleration (a).\n\nStep 5: Identify the quantity directly measured by the slope\nSince the slope of the graph is equal to the mass (m) of the object, we can conclude that the mass is the quantity directly measured using the slope of this graph.\n\nStep 6: Provide the final answer\nThe quantity directly measured using the slope of this graph is the inertial mass (D). Therefore, the answer is: Inertial mass.\n\nThe answer is: Inertial mass.",
