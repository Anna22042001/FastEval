Let's analyze each option:\n\nOption (A): (\u2203x)(Px \u2022 Sxj)\nThis option states that there exists an x such that x is a planet and x is smaller than Jupiter. However, this does not guarantee that all planets are smaller than Jupiter.

This option correctly represents the given statement, as it guarantees that every planet is smaller than Jupiter.\n\nOption (C): (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sjx)\nThis option states that for all x, if x is a planet, then Jupiter is smaller than x. This is the opposite of the given statement, as it states that Jupiter is smaller than every planet, which is not true.\n\nOption (D): (\u2200x)(Px \u2283 Sxj)\nThis option states that for all x, if x is a planet, then x is smaller than Jupiter. This option is similar to option (B), but it uses the implication symbol (\u2283) instead of the conjunction symbol (\u2022).
