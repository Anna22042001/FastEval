We need to choose the correct percentage from the given options.\n\nStep 2: Recall the information about phenylketonuria\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that causes an inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. If left untreated, PKU can lead to serious health problems, including mental retardation and seizures.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the risk of abnormality in the child\nSince PKU is a genetic disorder, there is a risk of passing the disorder to the child if the mother has untreated PKU. The risk of abnormality in the child depends on whether the father is a carrier of the PKU gene or not.\n\nStep 4: Determine the risk of abnormality in the child\nIf the father is not a carrier of the PKU gene, the risk of abnormality in the child is 50%. This is because the child will receive one copy of the PKU gene from the mother and one copy from the father. If the father does not carry the PKU gene, the child will have a 50% chance of inheriting the PKU gene from the mother.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct answer\nBased on the analysis in Step 4, we can conclude that the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated phenylketonuria is 50%.

In simpler terms, it measures the degree of inbreeding in a population.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options\nNow, let's analyze each option to determine which one is most likely to be affected by an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F):\n\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population\nHeterozygotes are individuals that have different alleles at a specific locus. Inbreeding increases the probability of homozygotes (individuals with identical alleles) and decreases the probability of heterozygotes. Therefore, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) is likely to result in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\n\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage\nLinkage is the tendency of genes to be inherited together. Inbreeding increases the probability of linkage, as it increases the probability of homozygotes. However, the question asks for the effect of an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F), which is already high. Therefore, the effect on linkage may not be significant.\n\n(C) higher proportion of genes with introns\nIntrons are non-coding sequences within genes. They are removed during the process of gene expression. The presence of introns is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient (F). Therefore, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) is not likely to result in a higher proportion of genes with introns.\n\n(D) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells\nThe difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells is not directly related to the inbreeding coefficient (F). Therefore, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) is not likely to result in a higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells.\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the option that is most likely to be affected by an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\n\nThe answer is: an increase in the inbreeding coefficient (F) is likely to result in a reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.",

This gene is responsible for producing a protein called haemoglobin, which is essential for carrying oxygen in the blood.\n\nStep 3: Identify the common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia\nThe most common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion of one or more of the four \u03b1-globin genes. This means that one or more of these genes are missing from the DNA, which leads to a reduction in the production of haemoglobin.\n\nStep 4: Match the correct option\nNow that we know the common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia is a deletion, we can match this information to the given options:\n\n(A) a deletion - This option corresponds to the common mutation in \u03b1-thalassaemia, which is a deletion of one or more \u03b1-globin genes.\n\n(B) a duplication - This option refers to a mutation where a section of DNA is repeated, which is not the case in \u03b1-thalassaemia.\n\n(C) an insertion - This option refers to a mutation where a new section of DNA is added, which is also not the case in \u03b1-thalassaemia.\n\n(D) a point mutation - This option refers to a mutation where a single nucleotide is changed, which is not the case in \u03b1-thalassaemia, as the mutation involves the deletion of entire genes.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on the information above, the correct option is (A) a deletion.
