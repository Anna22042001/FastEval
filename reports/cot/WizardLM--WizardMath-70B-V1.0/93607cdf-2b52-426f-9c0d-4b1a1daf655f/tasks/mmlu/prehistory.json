It does not describe the shape of the face.\n\n(B) prognathous: This term means having a jutting or forward-thrusting lower face. It matches the description given in the question.\n\n(C) diastema: This term refers to a gap between the teeth. It does not describe the shape of the face.\n\n(D) mandible: This term refers to the lower jaw. It does not describe the shape of the face.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct option\nBased on our analysis, the only option that fits the description of a forward-thrusting lower face is (B) prognathous.\n\nStep 5: Output the final answer\nThe correct answer is (B) prognathous.\n\nThe answer is: prognathous.",
