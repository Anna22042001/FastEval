Since the rate of increase is constant, we can multiply the initial population by the rate of increase and the time taken:\n- Population after 24 hours = (Initial population) * (Rate of increase) * (Time taken)\n- Population after 24 hours = (200) * (30) * (24) = 14400\n\nStep 4: Provide the final answer\nThe approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is 14400.

The figure skater starts facing north and spins 360 degrees (1 full circle). After this, she will be facing the same direction she started in, which is north.\n\n2. She continues to spin another 360 degrees (2 full circles). Again, after this, she will be facing the same direction she started in, which is north.\n\n3.

One die shows a 2, and the other two dice show 3's and a 5.\n4. All three dice show 2's.\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n1. For the first case, there are 5 ways to roll a 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), and there are 3 ways to roll a 3 (1, 2, or 3). So, there are 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 ways to get a product of 180 in this case.\n\n2.
