            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is true, we need to analyze each statement based on the geometry of the complexes and the properties of the ligands.\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nIn a square planar complex, the central metal atom is surrounded by four ligands, which form a square. For the complex to be optically active, there must be a chiral center, which can only be provided by the ligands. If all four ligands are identical, the complex will be achiral and cannot display optical isomerism. However, if the ligands are not identical, the complex can display optical isomerism due to the chiral centers provided by the different ligands. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nIn a tetrahedral complex, the central metal atom is surrounded by four ligands, which form a tetrahedron. Since the tetrahedron is a symmetric shape, there are no chiral centers in the complex. Therefore, tetrahedral complexes cannot display optical isomerism, regardless of the ligands being achiral or chiral. This statement is true.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nIn a linear complex, the central metal atom is surrounded by two ligands, which form a straight line. For the complex to be optically active, there must be a chiral center, which can be provided by the ligands. If both ligands are different, the complex can display optical isomerism due to the chiral centers provided by the different ligands. This statement is true.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nIn an octahedral complex, the central metal atom is surrounded by six ligands, which form an octahedron. For the complex to be optically active, there must be a chiral center, which can be provided by the ligands. If there are at least three different ligands, the complex can display optical isomerism due to the chiral centers provided by the different ligands. However, if there are only two different ligands, the complex can still display optical isomerism if the ligands are arranged in a chiral manner. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThe true statement is (C): Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nThe answer is: this statement is false.\nThe true statement is (C): Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider the nuclear shell model. The nuclear shell model is a way to describe the structure of the nucleus in terms of energy levels and the number of protons and neutrons in each level.\n\nThe magic numbers for the nuclear shell model are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. These are the numbers of protons or neutrons that can fill a complete shell in the nucleus.\n\nFor the 55Mn nuclide, we have 26 protons and 29 neutrons. The protons fill the first two shells (2+8=10) and the neutrons fill the first three shells (2+8+20=30).\n\nNow, we need to find the number of unpaired protons and neutrons. Since the protons fill the first two shells, there are no unpaired protons. The neutrons fill the first three shells, so there are 29-30=1 unpaired neutron.\n\nThe number of allowed energy levels for a nuclide is determined by the number of unpaired protons and neutrons. In this case, there is 1 unpaired neutron. Therefore, there are 3 allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide.\n\nThe answer is: there are 3 allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide.",

NMR frequency can be calculated using the Larmor equation, which is:\n\n\u03bd = (\u03b3 * B) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the NMR frequency, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus, and B is the magnetic field strength.\n\nStep 2: Find the gyromagnetic ratio of 31P\nThe gyromagnetic ratio for 31P is 17.235 T^(-1) * s^(-1). This value can be found in various resources, such as the NMR Shift Repository or other scientific literature.\n\nStep 3: Plug the values into the Larmor equation\nNow that we have the gyromagnetic ratio of 31P and the magnetic field strength (20.0 T), we can plug these values into the Larmor equation:\n\n\u03bd = (17.235 T^(-1) * s^(-1) * 20.0 T) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nStep 4: Calculate the NMR frequency\nPerform the calculations inside the parentheses first:\n\n\u03bd = (344.7 T^(-1) * s^(-1)) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nNext, divide by 2 * \u03c0:\n\n\u03bd \u2248 110.6 MHz\n\nStep 5: Compare the calculated NMR frequency with the given options\nWe have calculated the NMR frequency of 31P in a 20.0 T magnetic field to be approximately 110.6 MHz. Comparing this value with the given options, we can see that the closest option is:\n\n(A) 54.91 MHz\n\nHowever, this option is significantly lower than our calculated value.

This means that the intensity of the DMSO line is \u03b1, and the intensity of the AN line is 3 times the intensity of the DMSO line.\n\nStep 3: Determine the relationship between the concentrations and the relative intensities\nIn NMR spectroscopy, the relative intensity of a peak is directly proportional to the concentration of the corresponding compound. Therefore, the ratio of the relative intensities is equal to the ratio of the concentrations.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the ratio of the concentrations\nSince the relative intensity of the AN line is 3 times the intensity of the DMSO line, the ratio of the concentrations is also 3:1.\n\nStep 5: Write the final answer\nThe ratio of the two concentrations, [DMSO]:[AN], is 1:3.
