            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the effects of different types of fatty acids and dietary fibre on blood lipid metabolism. We will analyze each statement and provide a step-by-step explanation for the correct answer.\n\nStatement (A): Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nSaturated fatty acids are known to increase plasma triglyceride concentrations, while n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to decrease triglyceride levels. Therefore, replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 PUFAs is expected to result in a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nStatement (B): Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nMonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are known to have a neutral effect on LDL cholesterol levels. They neither increase nor decrease LDL cholesterol. Therefore, replacing saturated fatty acids with MUFAs is not expected to cause a significant change in LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nStatement (C): Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol.\n\nSoluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols are known to have a cholesterol-lowering effect. They can bind to cholesterol in the gut and prevent its absorption, leading to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, consuming soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is expected to result in a decrease in LDL cholesterol, not an increase.\n\nStatement (D): Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nReplacing saturated fatty acids with carbohydrates can lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. However, consuming large amounts of carbohydrates can also lead to an increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations. Therefore, the statement is only partially correct.\n\nBased on the analysis of each statement, the correct answer is (A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.\n\nThe answer is: the correct answer is (A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations.",

Oxygen: Vitamin C is sensitive to oxygen, and its presence in the headspace of canned food can cause losses of vitamin C. To minimize these losses, the amount of oxygen in the headspace is kept at a low level. Therefore, statement (A) is incorrect.\n\n2. Reheating: Reheating canned vegetables before serving can cause significant losses of vitamin C due to the heat exposure. This is because vitamin C is sensitive to heat and can degrade when exposed to high temperatures. Therefore, statement (B) is incorrect.\n\n3. Canned fruits: Losses of vitamin C are generally higher for canned fruits than for canned vegetables due to the higher acidity of fruits, which can cause the vitamin C to degrade more quickly. Therefore, statement (C) is correct.\n\n4. Storage temperature: Losses of vitamin C in canned foods during storage at ambient temperature can be significant, especially if the cans are not stored in a cool, dark place. The heat and light exposure can cause the vitamin C to degrade over time. Therefore, statement (D) is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct statement is (C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables.\n\nThe answer is: (C) Losses of vitamin C are much higher for most canned fruits than those for canned vegetables.",

Glucose is absorbed through the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) in the small intestine. This transporter uses the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump to drive the uptake of glucose into the enterocytes.\n\nStatement (B): Fructose is absorbed more rapidly than glucose.\nThis statement is false. Glucose is absorbed more rapidly than fructose. Glucose is absorbed through the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), while fructose is absorbed through the fructose transporter (GLUT5). The rate of glucose absorption is higher than that of fructose due to the higher affinity of SGLT1 for glucose compared to GLUT5 for fructose.\n\nStatement (C): Galactose and fructose are absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane.\nThis statement is false. Galactose is absorbed through the sodium-dependent galactose transporter (SGLT2), while fructose is absorbed through the fructose transporter (GLUT5). These are two different transporters with different affinities for their respective sugars.\n\nStatement (D): Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the colon.\nThis statement is false. Most water absorption along the GI tract occurs in the small intestine. The colon is responsible for the absorption of water and electrolytes to maintain fluid balance, but the majority of water absorption occurs in the small intestine due to its larger surface area and higher concentration of water channels (aquaporins).\n\nBased on our analysis, the most correct statement is (A): The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.\n\nThe answer is: The most correct statement is (A): The absorption of glucose is associated with sodium uptake.",
