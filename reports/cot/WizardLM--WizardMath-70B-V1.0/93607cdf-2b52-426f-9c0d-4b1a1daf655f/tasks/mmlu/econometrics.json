It is used to evaluate the accuracy of a forecasting model for percentage or ratio data.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\n\n(A) Mean squared error is usually highly correlated with trading rule profitability:\n\nMean squared error is a measure of forecast accuracy, while trading rule profitability is a measure of the financial performance of a trading strategy. There is no direct correlation between these two measures, as they are not directly related. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(B) Mean absolute error provides a quadratic loss function:\n\nA quadratic loss function is a function where the loss increases quadratically with the error. Mean absolute error is a linear function, meaning that the loss increases linearly with the error. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n(C) Mean absolute percentage error is a useful measure for evaluating asset return forecasts:\n\nMean absolute percentage error is a measure that is particularly useful for evaluating forecasts of percentage or ratio data. Asset return forecasts often involve percentage data, so this statement is true.\n\n(D) Mean squared error penalises large forecast errors disproportionately more than small forecast errors:\n\nMean squared error is a measure that penalizes large errors more than small errors because the squared term amplifies the difference.

In this case, since we only have one coefficient (the intercept), the standard error is the square root of the variance of the intercept.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the margin of error (ME).\nThe margin of error is the product of the standard error and the critical value from the standard normal distribution table.
