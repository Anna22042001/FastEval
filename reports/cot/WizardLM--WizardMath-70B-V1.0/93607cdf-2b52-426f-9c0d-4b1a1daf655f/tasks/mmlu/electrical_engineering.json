            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nWe are asked to identify the Most Significant Digit (MSD) in a decimal number system. The given options are:\n- (A) First digit from left to right\n- (B) First digit from right to left\n- (C) Middle digit\n- (D) Mean of all digits\n\nStep 2: Analyze the options\nWe need to determine which of these options best represents the MSD in a decimal number system.\n\nOption (A): First digit from left to right\nThis option refers to the digit that is the farthest to the left in a decimal number. In a decimal number system, this digit is the most significant because it represents the largest power of 10. For example, in the number 123, the first digit from left to right is 1, which represents 10^2 (100).\n\nOption (B): First digit from right to left\nThis option refers to the digit that is the farthest to the right in a decimal number. In a decimal number system, this digit is the least significant because it represents the smallest power of 10. For example, in the number 123, the first digit from right to left is 3, which represents 10^0 (1).\n\nOption (C): Middle digit\nThis option refers to the digit that is in the middle of a decimal number. In a decimal number system, the middle digit is not necessarily the most significant. For example, in the number 123, the middle digit is 2, which represents 10^1 (10). However, the digit 1 (representing 10^2) is more significant than the digit 2 (representing 10^1).\n\nOption (D): Mean of all digits\nThis option refers to the average of all the digits in a decimal number. In a decimal number system, the mean of all digits is not a concept that is relevant to the significance of a digit. For example, in the number 123, the mean of the digits is (1+2+3)/3 = 2, which does not represent any specific power of 10.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, the most significant digit (MSD) in a decimal number system is the first digit from left to right, which is option (A). This is because the first digit from left to right represents the largest power of 10 in the number.\n\nThe answer is: (A) First digit from left to right.",

This eliminates option (B) RL, as it only contains resistors and no reactive components.\n\nStep 4: Compare the remaining options\nNow we have three options left: LC, RC, and Any of the above. Let's analyze each option in detail.\n\nOption (A) LC: This option contains both a capacitor and an inductor. Since the lowest critical frequency is due to a pole, and both capacitors and inductors can create poles, this option is a possible candidate.\n\nOption (C) RC: This option contains a resistor and a capacitor. While capacitors can create poles, resistors cannot. Therefore, the lowest critical frequency in this network would not be due to a pole, making this option incorrect.\n\nOption (D) Any of the above: This option is incorrect because we have already eliminated one incorrect option (RL) and found one correct option (LC). Therefore, \"any of the above\" cannot be the correct answer.\n\nStep 5: Provide the final answer\nBased on our analysis, the correct option is (A) LC.

This surface is enclosed in a cube with a side length of 10 meters. We need to find the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube.\n\nStep 2: Visualize the problem\nImagine the cube as a box with the metal surface at the center. The electric displacement will be directed radially outward from the metal surface. Since the cube has 6 faces, the electric displacement will be distributed over these 6 faces.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the electric displacement on one face\nThe electric displacement (D) can be related to the electric field (E) and the distance (d) between the charges using the formula D = \u03b5\u2080 * E * d, where \u03b5\u2080 is the vacuum permittivity (approximately 8.854 x 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 F/m).\n\nIn this case, the distance d is the radius of the metal surface (1 meter). The electric field E can be found using the formula E = \u03c3 / \u03b5\u2080, where \u03c3 is the surface charge density (20 coulombs/m\u00b2).\n\nSo, E = 20 / (8.854 x 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2) = 2.267 x 10\u00b9\u00b9 V/m.\n\nNow, we can find the electric displacement on one face: D = 8.854 x 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2 * 2.267 x 10\u00b9\u00b9 * 1 = 20 coulombs.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total outward electric displacement\nSince there are 6 faces on the cube, the total outward electric displacement will be 6 times the electric displacement on one face:\n\nTotal outward electric displacement = 6 * 20 = 120 coulombs.\n\nStep 5: Write the final answer\nThe total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is 120 coulombs. However, the given options are in terms of \u03c0, so we need to convert 120 coulombs to the nearest option:\n\n120 coulombs \u2248 40\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (A) 40\u03c0 coulombs.\n\nThe answer is: 40\\pi.",
