The black book is the third from the left.\n4. The brown book is the leftmost.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the purple book is to the left of the yellow book. From statement 2, we know that the black book is to the left of the purple book. This means that the yellow book is to the right of the black book.\n\nNow, let's analyze the position of the black book. From statement 3, we know that the black book is the third from the left. This means that there are two books to the left of the black book. Since the black book is to the left of the purple book, and the purple book is to the left of the yellow book, we can conclude that the two books to the left of the black book are the purple book and the yellow book.\n\nTherefore, the third book from the left is the brown book, as stated in statement 4.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n(A) The yellow book is the third from the left",
