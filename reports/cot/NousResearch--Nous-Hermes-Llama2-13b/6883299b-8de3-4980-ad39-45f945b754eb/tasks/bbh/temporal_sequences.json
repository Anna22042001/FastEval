Jessica saw Susan taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 12pm to 1pm.\n5. Steven saw Susan buying lunch at the deli from 1pm to 2pm.\n6. Thomas saw Susan reading at the library from 2pm to 6pm.\n\nBased on the given information, we know that Susan was at the water park, mall, Eiffel Tower, deli, and library between 7am and 6pm. Since the coffee shop was closed after 9pm, it is not a valid option for Susan to have gone there during those hours.\n\nTherefore, between what times could Susan have gone to the coffee shop before 6pm? We can narrow down the options by considering the activities mentioned above. The only time slot left for Susan to have gone to the coffee shop would be during her lunch break between buying lunch at the deli and reading at the library, which falls between 1pm and 2pm.\n\nThe answer is:\n(C) 1pm to 2pm.",
