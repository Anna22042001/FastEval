The falcon is the rightmost.\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that the falcon is the rightmost bird. Let's analyze why:\n- The quail is to the left of the hummingbird, so the hummingbird must be in the middle.\n- The raven is to the right of the hummingbird, so the hummingbird must be in the second position from the left.\n- The cardinal is the second from the left, so the quail must be in the first position from the left.\n- The owl is to the left of the cardinal, so the cardinal must be in the third position from the left.\n- The raven is the third from the right, so the falcon must be in the seventh position from the left (which means it is the rightmost bird).\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(G) The cardinal is the rightmost.",
