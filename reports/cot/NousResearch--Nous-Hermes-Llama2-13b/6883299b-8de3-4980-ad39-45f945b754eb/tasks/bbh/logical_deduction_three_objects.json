We also know that the minivan is older than the truck. Finally, we know that the limousine is the second-newest.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n(A) The limousine is the oldest: This option is not possible because we know that the minivan is older than the truck. Therefore, the limousine cannot be the oldest.\n\n(B) The truck is the oldest: This option is possible because we know that the minivan is older than the truck. So, the truck could be the oldest.\n\n(C) The minivan is the oldest: This option is not possible because we know that the limousine is the second-newest. If the minivan was the second-newest, then it would be the newest, which contradicts the information that the limousine is the second-newest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) The truck is the oldest.",
