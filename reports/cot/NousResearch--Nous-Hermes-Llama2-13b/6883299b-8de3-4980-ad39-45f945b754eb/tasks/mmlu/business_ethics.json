            "model_answer": "Answer: (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime\n\nReasoning:\n\nFrom the options given, Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream and have a whole host of associated ethical implications. The next description aligns with the properties of cryptocurrencies, which are known to be expensive. These digital currencies use a lot of energy and computational power to mint and process transactions, and the costs are reflected in the transaction fees. The third description highlights that they are also secure, as cryptocurrencies use cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Finally, financial crime is often associated with cryptocurrencies, as they provide anonymity and can be used to engage in illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Cryptocurrencies, Expensive, Secure, Financial Crime.",

In recent years, the issue of work-life balance has become a hotly debated topic due to the intensification of work and technological shifts. Presenteeism, absenteeism, and work-play balance are not as closely related to the desired balance between work and non-work related activities as work-life balance is.

This is because industrial ecosystems also involve a network of interconnected companies and industries, where resources and waste are exchanged and reused within the system.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Industrial ecosystems.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked.\nReasoning: \nThe sentence starts by saying that business-CSO collaborations have limitations and risks. Then it mentions three specific examples of these limitations and risks. \nThe first limitation is a power imbalance, which is usually defined as an unequal distribution of resources or influence between two parties. This is indicated by the use of the word \"where for example one party possess more resources.\" \nThe second limitation is an unfair distribution of benefits, which means that one party gains more from the relationship than the other party. This is indicated by the use of the word \"where one party gains more from the relationship.\" \nThe third limitation is the risk of CSOs being hoodwinked, which means misled or deceived, often unintentionally. This is indicated by the use of the word \"are all limitations and risks of business-CSO collaborations.\" \nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Power imbalance, Benefits, Hoodwinked.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) The Categorical Imperative.\n\nAlthough corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories, it is most similar to The Categorical Imperative. The Categorical Imperative is a philosophical concept in the field of ethics, originally developed by Immanuel Kant. It states that we should act only according to a rule that we would want to be a universal law.\n\nIn the context of corporate profit maximization, we can argue that it is not directly prescribed by major normative theories because it does not prioritize the well-being of all stakeholders involved. However, from a Kantian perspective, we can say that corporations should act according to a rule that would lead to maximizing profits in a way that could be universally applicable. This means that they should maximize profits while also ensuring that their actions do not harm others or the environment.\n\nTherefore, although not directly prescribed by normative theories, corporate profit maximization is most similar to The Categorical Imperative.",

            "model_answer": "Milton Friedman, an American economist, believed that the sole responsibility of business is to its shareholders. This belief is often referred to as the Friedman doctrine. Friedman argued that the primary goal of a business is to generate profits for its shareholders, and that any other social responsibilities should be left to the government and individuals acting on their own. He believed that when businesses attempt to fulfill social responsibilities, they may not be as profitable, which can ultimately harm shareholders. Therefore, according to Friedman, the only social responsibility of business is to its shareholders. The answer is (A).",
