            "model_answer": "The term for a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties is (B) Satisficing. \n\nSatisficing is a term coined by psychologist Herbert A. Simon to describe a decision-making process in which individuals seek out an acceptable, but not necessarily optimal, solution to a problem. In the context of negotiations, satisficing means that both parties may not achieve their ideal outcome but instead settle for an agreement that is satisfactory for both. This approach can help avoid the potential costs and risks associated with prolonged negotiations or failed agreements.",

People often use heuristics because they are quick, easy, and require little or no calculation. However, heuristics are prone to errors and can lead to systematic biases in decision-making. One such example is the \"availability heuristic,\" where people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events that come easily to mind.",

The level of rivalry among existing competitors is one of these factors and it refers to the intensity of competition between established companies in the industry.",
