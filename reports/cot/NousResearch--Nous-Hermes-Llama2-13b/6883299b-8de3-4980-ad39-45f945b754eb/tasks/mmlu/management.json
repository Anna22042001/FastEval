            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which type of culture workers' acceptance of change is characteristic of, we need to consider the different types of cultures and how they handle change. \n\n(A) Team culture: In a team culture, individuals work together towards a common goal. Team members are often encouraged to collaborate and communicate with one another. If workers in a team culture are accepting of change, it means that they are open to new ideas and ways of working together to achieve their goals.\n\n(B) Collaborative culture: A collaborative culture is similar to a team culture, but with a stronger emphasis on cooperation and communication. In this type of culture, workers are encouraged to work together and share ideas to achieve common goals. If workers in a collaborative culture are accepting of change, it means that they are willing to work together to find new ways of achieving their goals.\n\n(C) Group culture: In a group culture, individuals are encouraged to work independently and compete with one another. This type of culture is often found in high-pressure environments, such as sales or finance. If workers in a group culture are accepting of change, it may mean that they are willing to adapt to new ways of working independently to achieve their goals.\n\n(D) Collective culture: A collective culture is characterized by a strong sense of community and shared values. In this type of culture, individuals are encouraged to work together towards common goals and to support one another. If workers in a collective culture are accepting of change, it means that they are willing to work together to find new ways of achieving their goals and supporting one another.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) Collective culture.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Company. \n\nWhile all of the options listed are important layers of cultural influence, a company is not one of them. A company is an organization or business, and its culture is influenced by various factors such as social, organizational, and business layers. \n\nSocial layer refers to the cultural norms, values, and beliefs that are prevalent in a society or community. These norms and values shape the way people interact with each other and influence the culture of a company.\n\nOrganizational layer refers to the structure, policies, and procedures of an organization. These factors influence the culture of a company by defining the roles and responsibilities of employees, setting expectations, and shaping the work environment.\n\nBusiness layer refers to the goals, objectives, and strategies of a business.

This typically happens when one company purchases another company, resulting in the acquired company becoming a subsidiary of the acquiring company. In this scenario, the two partners are not equal before the acquisition, and the buyout results in one company taking control of the other. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Two unequal partners become one after a buyout.",
