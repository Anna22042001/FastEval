            "model_answer": "Nearsightedness, also known as myopia, is a refractive error that causes distant objects to appear blurry while close objects remain in focus. The main cause of nearsightedness is the physical shape of the eye, specifically the curvature of the cornea and lens.\n\nThe cornea is the transparent outer layer at the front of the eye, and the lens is the transparent inner layer behind the iris. In a normally-sighted person, the cornea and lens work together to refract (bend) incoming light so that it focuses directly on the retina at the back of the eye. In a nearsighted person, the cornea and lens are too curved, causing the light to focus in front of the retina instead of on it.\n\nThe cause of this increased curvature is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop the condition, and factors such as prolonged reading or working at a computer, high stress, poor diet, and lack of outdoor activity have also been linked to increased risk of nearsightedness.\n\nSo, the answer is (A) too much curvature of the cornea and lens.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The approach that expresses the idea that some motives are more imperative to survival than others is (D) Hierarchy of needs. In Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory, he proposes that human needs are arranged in a hierarchical order, with basic physiological and safety needs being the most imperative to survival, followed by love and belongingness needs, esteem needs, and finally, self-actualization needs. This theory suggests that the satisfaction of lower-level needs is a prerequisite for the satisfaction of higher-level needs, and that some needs are more fundamental and urgent than others.",

This means that a valid test accurately assesses the concepts or skills it intends to evaluate. Validity is commonly divided into content validity, which assesses the relevance of the test items to the content of the test, and criterion validity, which evaluates the extent to which the test predicts or correlates with some external criterion or measure.

Riles was a landmark case in the United States that established the principle that students with disabilities have a right to a free, appropriate public education. This case set a precedent for future cases and led to the passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which ensures that students with disabilities receive special education and related services to meet their unique needs.

            "model_answer": "(A) variance provides the most information about how spread out a distribution of scores is.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe variance is the square of the standard deviation, which is a measure of the spread of the data. It takes into account the variability of the data at both ends of the distribution as well as the middle. The variance gives a more accurate picture of how spread out the data is compared to the range, which only takes into account the difference between the highest and lowest values. The mean, while useful for describing the center of the distribution, does not give any information about the spread of the data. The median, like the mean, does not give information about the spread of the data, but instead describes the position of the middle value in the distribution. Therefore, the answer is (A) variance.",
