            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. \n\nHere's the reasoning: \n\nThe given options are (A), (B), (C), and (D). We need to determine which of these options best describes the finding of Brown & Harris (1978) study on depression. \n\nOption (A) states that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. This option is consistent with the idea that social support can play a role in protecting individuals from stress and depression. \n\nOption (B) states that self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. This option is not consistent with the idea that women are more susceptible to stress and depression. \n\nOption (C) states that men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. This option is consistent with the idea that men and women have similar levels of depression, but it does not address the role of social support in women's susceptibility to stress. \n\nOption (D) states that men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. This option is not consistent with the idea that women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers. \n\nThe reason for this is that sociological communities are not a new form of community. They are traditional communities that have existed for a long time and are based on shared interests, values, and beliefs. In contrast, the other options are new forms of community that have emerged in recent times due to various factors such as migration, urbanization, and the rise of the internet. \n\n(A) ethnic communities are formed by people who share a common identity and experience of discrimination. They are a new form of community that has emerged as a result of globalization and migration.\n(B) gay villages are formed in certain parts of large cities where gay people live and socialize. They are a new form of community that has emerged as a result of the gay rights movement.\n(D) virtual communities are formed online and exist only in cyberspace.

Instrumentally-rational action: This type of action is based on the calculation of means and ends, where individuals act in a way that they believe will lead to the most effective outcome.\n\n2. Value-rational action: This type of action is based on the belief in the inherent value of certain ends, where individuals act in a way that they believe will lead to the realization of their values or ideals.\n\n3. Traditional action: This type of action is based on the acceptance of traditional rules and norms, where individuals act in a way that is consistent with the customs and traditions of their society.\n\n4. Affective action: This type of action is based on the emotional attachment to certain values or objects, where individuals act in a way that is influenced by their emotions and feelings.\n\nTherefore, the fourth type of social action is affective, which is the correct answer.",

This matches the information given, as the pattern of drug use in Britain shows that drug use has increased and is not limited to a specific subculture. \n\nOption (B) states that the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy. This also matches the information given, as Ecstasy is a popular recreational drug in Britain. \n\nOption (C) states that teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This does not match the information given, as the pattern of drug use in Britain does not specifically mention gender differences in drug use. \n\nOption (D) states that despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare. This also does not match the information given, as the pattern of drug use in Britain shows that drug use has increased, not decreased. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The proportion of housework men did was greatest when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time. \n\nReasoning: \nSullivan's (2000) study suggests that when men are unemployed or both partners work full time, the division of labor within the household changes. In such situations, men may be more likely to take on household tasks that were traditionally performed by women. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as economic necessity or a desire to share household responsibilities more equally. Therefore, the answer is (D) they were unemployed or both partners worked full time.",

This means that the researcher is not open about their true intentions and reasons for being present in the setting. Deceiving the respondents as to the reason for your presence is a major ethical problem with covert participant observation because it violates the principle of informed consent. Informed consent requires that participants have a clear understanding of the purpose and goals of the research, as well as any potential risks or harms associated with participation. By deceiving the respondents, the researcher is not allowing them to make an informed decision about whether or not to participate in the study. This can lead to a lack of trust and cooperation from the participants, and may also result in harm to the participants if the researcher is not careful to avoid causing harm.",

Fixed-choice questions, on the other hand, are multiple-choice questions that limit the respondent's answer to a fixed set of options. While these questions can be useful in some surveys, they can also be limiting and may not capture the full range of a respondent's thoughts or opinions. Short questions are also useful in surveys as they are easy to answer and can help to reduce respondent fatigue. Funnelled questions are those that are designed to lead the respondent to a particular answer or response, which can also skew the results of the survey.",
