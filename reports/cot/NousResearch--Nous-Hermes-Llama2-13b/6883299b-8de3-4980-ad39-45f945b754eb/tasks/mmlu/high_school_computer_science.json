However, some parts of the program may need to be expressed in binary code, such as when dealing with low-level hardware operations or when working with data that needs to be represented in binary form.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because while it is true that programs can be expressed in binary code, using a higher-level programming language is generally more efficient and easier to understand for humans.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because while it is true that binary code can be used to reduce the likelihood of errors, using a higher-level programming language can also help reduce errors and is generally more efficient for expressing complex operations.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because while it is true that binary code can only be used to represent data, programs can also be expressed in binary code, albeit not as efficiently as in a higher-level programming language.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Some parts of the program can be expressed as binary code, but operations must be expressed using a higher-level programming language.",
