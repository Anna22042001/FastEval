            "model_answer": "To determine which segments are required to be separately disclosed, we need to look at the criteria for disclosure set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). According to the FASB, an operating segment is required to be reported if it meets any of the following criteria:\n\n1. It engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses that are eliminated in consolidation).\n2. Its operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.\n3. It has discrete financial information available that is reviewed by the CODM.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can see that Segment A and Segment B meet all three criteria for disclosure, while Segment C only meets the first criterion. Therefore, Segment A and Segment B are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements.\n\nAnswer: (A) A and B only.",

            "model_answer": "All of the options listed are important aspects of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice. However, the correct answer is (A) Acceptance of a client relationship.\n\nAcceptance of a client relationship is the first step in the auditing process and is crucial in determining the scope and nature of the audit. The firm must assess the risk associated with the client and determine whether the engagement is suitable for the firm to undertake. This includes evaluating the client's financial position, industry, and management's attitude towards the audit process.\n\nProfessional skepticism of management (B) is also an important aspect of quality control policies and procedures. Auditors must maintain a questioning mind and be alert to potential misstatements or irregularities in the financial statements.\n\nComputer information processing (C) is essential in the auditing process, as technology has revolutionized the way auditors gather, process, and analyze data. Auditors must have a thorough understanding of computer information systems and be able to use them effectively in the audit process.\n\nEfficiency of organizational structures (D) is also important in ensuring that the firm can effectively manage its resources and complete audits in a timely and cost-effective manner. However, this is not specific to the auditing practice and is more relevant to the overall management of the firm.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Acceptance of a client relationship.",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement regarding a shareholder's right to inspect corporate books and records is (C) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose. \n\nUnder most state corporation laws, shareholders have the right to inspect the corporation's books and records for a proper purpose. A proper purpose is generally defined as a purpose related to the shareholder's interest as a shareholder, such as evaluating the company's financial condition or investigating potential mismanagement or fraud. \n\nThe right to inspect corporate books and records is not absolute, as it is subject to certain limitations and conditions. For example, the shareholder may be required to provide a written demand and may be limited in the amount of information they can access. Additionally, the right may be limited or denied if the demand is deemed to be for an improper purpose, such as harassing the company or competing with its business. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Requires that the demand to inspect be for a proper purpose.",

Rune had a $1,000 check payable to Rune that was deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance, but returned by the bank on December 30 stamped \"NSF\".\n\nFirst, we need to adjust the checkbook balance for the $1,000 check that was returned by the bank.

Therefore, the adjusted checkbook balance on December 31 is $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000.\n\nNext, we need to consider the $4,000 check payable to Rune that was postdated January 3. Since this check was not included in the December 31 checkbook balance, it should be added to the adjusted checkbook balance to determine the total cash available to Rune on December 31.
