            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The Gulf of Tonkin resolution was significant because it allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam. \n\nIn August 1964, North Vietnamese boats allegedly attacked US warships in the Gulf of Tonkin. In response, President Lyndon B. Johnson requested and received from Congress the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which granted him broad powers to use military force in Vietnam without seeking further congressional approval. \n\nThis resolution allowed the US to intensify its involvement in Vietnam by expanding its military presence and conducting more aggressive operations. It also set the stage for a long-term commitment of US forces in Vietnam, with significant consequences for both the US and Vietnam.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Answer: (D) Both b and c.\n\nThe Cold War had significant implications for American exceptionalism, which is the belief that the United States is unique and different from other countries due to its ideals, values, and history. \n\nOn one hand, the Cold War enhanced American exceptionalism by reinforcing the idea that America was the 'leader of the free world' and that its ideals of democracy, capitalism, and freedom were superior to those of the Soviet Union. This positioned the United States as a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world and further solidified its exceptional status.\n\nOn the other hand, the extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism. The United States' involvement in conflicts and its actions in other countries, often in the name of fighting communism, led to criticism that America was not so different from other countries after all. Additionally, the tension and fear of nuclear war during the Cold War led some to question the idea that the United States was exceptional and destined for a unique and positive role in history.\n\nOverall, American exceptionalism was both enhanced and challenged during the Cold War, making the correct answer (D) Both b and c.",

            "model_answer": "Franklin D. Roosevelt initially favoured an 'isolationist' stance on the part of the US during the 1930s primarily due to his belief in internal reform and economic regeneration. At that time, the US was still recovering from the Great Depression, and Roosevelt saw focusing on domestic issues as a priority. Additionally, he was concerned about the instability in Europe and the potential for the US to become involved in another European war. Given these factors, Roosevelt's isolationist stance can be seen as a way to prioritize the needs of the US while avoiding potential international conflicts.",

It was characterized by a focus on the common person, their needs and their interests, as opposed to the elite or established politicians. \nThe movement was influenced by a variety of factors including economic hardship, social changes, and the rise of new communication technologies. Its supporters argued that the government should be more responsive to the will of the people, rather than being controlled by a few powerful individuals or groups. \nWhile the New Populism was primarily a domestic movement, it did have some implications for foreign policy. It was associated with a rejection of imperialism and a preference for isolationism. The supporters of the New Populism believed that the United States should focus on its own interests and not get involved in overseas conflicts. \nTherefore, the correct answer is: \n(A) A strand of neo-isolationist sentiment.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nWorld War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States because the United States became a creditor country and financial center, while European countries were devastated by the war and faced economic hardship. During the war, European countries borrowed money from the US to finance their war efforts. This increased the US economy, as European countries had fewer resources to invest in the US. Additionally, the United States was able to produce more goods for Europe since they were not involved in the war. As a result, the US became the leading financial center in the world.",
