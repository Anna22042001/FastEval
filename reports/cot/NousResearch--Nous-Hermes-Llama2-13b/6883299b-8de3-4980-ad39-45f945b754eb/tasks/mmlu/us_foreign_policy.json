            "question": "International trade will almost always benefit both countries, so why do countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market?\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed\n(C) Regime type\n(D) International conflict prevents trade",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed.\n\nWhile international trade can benefit both countries, there are some reasons why countries might try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market. One reason is that the costs of free trade can be concentrated in certain industries or regions, while the benefits are dispersed across the entire economy. This means that the people who are most affected by free trade, such as workers in industries that are exposed to foreign competition, may feel that they are bearing a disproportionate share of the costs. As a result, they may pressure their government to take action to protect their jobs and industries.\n\nAnother reason is that the leadership of a country might have irrational beliefs about the benefits of free trade, or they might be influenced by special interests that stand to gain from protectionist policies. Additionally, some countries may engage in protectionist policies due to their regime type, such as authoritarian regimes that seek to control the economy and limit the influence of foreign powers. Finally, international conflict or tension can also prevent trade, as countries may be hesitant to engage in trade with their enemies or rivals.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Paul Kennedy argued in his book The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers that the decline of a great power is often due to a combination of economic, military, and political factors. He used historical examples to show that no country has been able to maintain its status as a great power indefinitely, and that the United States was showing signs of decline in the late 20th century. Kennedy did not argue that the United States was already in decline, nor did he suggest that the rise of Japan was exaggerated. Instead, he suggested that the United States could avoid decline if it addressed its economic, military, and political challenges.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) The United States became a creditor country and financial centre, with European war spending boosting the US economy.\n\nWorld War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States due to several factors. One of the main reasons was that European countries were devastated by the war, both in terms of loss of life and destruction of infrastructure. This led to a significant decrease in their economic power and influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the United States was not directly involved in the war and therefore did not suffer the same level of destruction and loss of life. This allowed the US economy to continue growing and expanding during the war years.\n\nAdditionally, European countries needed to finance their war efforts, and they turned to the United States for loans. This influx of money from European war spending boosted the US economy and further increased the country's economic power.\n\nAfter the war, the United States also seized German resources and became a creditor country and financial center, further solidifying its position as a global economic powerhouse.\n\nIn summary, World War I shifted economic power from Europe to the United States due to the US economy's continued growth during the war, European countries' reliance on US loans, and the seizure of German resources by the US after the war.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "There are several possible constraints on US foreign policy decision making. \n(A) Foreign policies of other states: The policies of other countries can have a significant impact on US foreign policy. For example, if a key ally is facing a crisis, the US may need to adjust its policies to support that ally. \n(B) International law: The US is bound by international law, including treaties and conventions that it has signed. This can limit the options available to US policymakers, as they must take international law into account when making decisions. \n(C) Intergovernmental organizations: The US is a member of several intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations, which can also constrain its foreign policy options. These organizations can set standards and expectations that the US must follow. \nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) All of the above.",

This means that the treaty focused on reducing the number of nuclear weapons that could be used to deliver a nuclear strike, rather than demobilizing armies or dismantling all nuclear weapons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) Required the United States and Russia to dismantle a significant number of their nuclear weapons.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) ALL of the above. \n\nInternational trade agreements work through a combination of mechanisms to facilitate trade and cooperation among countries. \n\n(A) Reciprocity across multiple issues: International trade agreements often involve reciprocal commitments from countries to open their markets to each other's goods and services. This can involve reducing tariffs and other trade barriers, as well as agreeing to common standards and regulations.\n\n(B) Reputational concerns of the actors: Countries have an incentive to uphold their commitments under international trade agreements because of the reputational costs of not doing so. If a country is seen as reneging on its commitments, it may face diplomatic and economic sanctions, and may be less likely to be trusted in future negotiations.\n\n(C) Side payments for adjusting to the organization (such as the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU): International trade agreements may also involve side payments or compensation for countries that are adversely affected by the agreement. For example, the Common Agricultural Policy in the EU provides subsidies to farmers to help them adjust to the changes in market conditions brought about by the single market.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) ALL of the above.",

During his first term, Reagan increased military spending, which put pressure on the Soviet Union to keep up with its international commitments. This led to a significant increase in the US military budget, while the Soviet Union struggled to keep up. Additionally, Reagan's strong stance against communism and his support for anti-communist movements around the world further weakened the Soviet Union's position. Therefore, some scholars argue that Reagan's policies were instrumental in bringing about the end of the Cold War and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "American exceptionalism is a belief that the United States is unique and superior to other countries, with a strong emphasis on individualism and a distrust of centralized government. This belief may lead to opposition to world government for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, American exceptionalism is generally anti-statism, meaning it opposes centralized government and favors individual sovereignty. This could lead to a rejection of the idea of a world government, which would be a centralized authority over all nations.\n\nSecondly, some proponents of American exceptionalism may view world government as impractical or unrealistic. They may believe that the United States is so unique and powerful that no global government could effectively govern all nations equally.\n\nFinally, some Americans may view the United Nations as a sufficient form of global governance, and therefore oppose the idea of a world government. They may believe that the UN is already doing a good job of promoting international cooperation and addressing global issues, and that a world government would be unnecessary or even detrimental to American interests.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government.",
