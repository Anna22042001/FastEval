            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which country is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider the availability of resources such as minerals, water, and energy in each country. \n\n(A) United States: The United States has a diverse range of natural resources, including minerals such as coal, copper, and gold, as well as extensive water resources and a variety of energy sources such as oil, natural gas, and renewable energy. \n\n(B) Japan: Japan has limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports for minerals, water, and energy. However, the country has made significant investments in renewable energy and has a strong focus on energy efficiency. \n\n(C) France: France has a diverse range of natural resources, including minerals such as coal, iron ore, and uranium, as well as water resources and a variety of energy sources such as nuclear, hydro, and wind power. \n\n(D) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has a similar range of natural resources to France, with minerals such as coal, iron ore, and uranium, as well as water resources and a variety of energy sources such as nuclear, hydro, and wind power. \n\nBased on this analysis, the least self-sufficient country in terms of natural resources needed for modern industry would be (B) Japan, due to its heavy reliance on imports for minerals, water, and energy.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process by which a new fashion design is introduced globally is most likely to be (A) contagious diffusion. \n\nContagious diffusion is a type of diffusion that occurs when an innovation spreads through a population in a short period of time, often through interpersonal communication. Fashion is often seen as a trendy and rapidly changing industry, with new designs being introduced frequently. The spread of these designs can be influenced by celebrities, social media, and other forms of interpersonal communication. \n\nIn contrast, relocation diffusion occurs when individuals or organizations move to a new area and bring their innovations with them. While this may happen in the fashion industry, it is less likely to be the primary mechanism for the spread of new designs globally. \n\nInnovative diffusion refers to the spread of new ideas or products, but it does not necessarily imply that the innovation is rapidly spreading through a population. \n\nHierarchical diffusion is a type of diffusion that occurs when an innovation is introduced to a population through a hierarchical structure, such as a company or government organization. While this may be relevant in some aspects of the fashion industry, it is less likely to be the primary mechanism for the spread of new designs globally.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) contagious diffusion.",

            "model_answer": "The statement that is NOT part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is (B) The core will always dominate the periphery. This is because Myrdal's theory emphasizes the interdependence between the core and periphery, and how the core's growth and prosperity can be at the expense of the periphery. However, Myrdal did not suggest that the core will always dominate the periphery, but rather that the relationship between the two is complex and dynamic.",

            "model_answer": "(D) World cities are found only in the northern and western hemispheres.\n\nExplanation:\nWorld cities are characterized by their global connectivity, economic importance, and cultural significance. They contain the headquarters of many transnational corporations, are well connected to secondary-level world cities, and contain many offices of multinational organizations. However, world cities are not limited to the northern and western hemispheres. There are world cities in other regions of the world as well, such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Singapore in the eastern hemisphere. Therefore, option (D) is not a characteristic of world cities.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) agglomeration.\n\nAgglomeration refers to the process of clustering or concentrating economic activities, such as production and consumption, in specific locations. This can lead to benefits such as increased productivity, lower costs, and better access to resources and markets. The opposite of agglomeration is deglomeration, which refers to the dispersal of economic activities across a larger area.\n\nThe substitution principle refers to the idea that when the cost of one input increases, it may be replaced by a cheaper input, resulting in no change in the overall cost of production. This principle is not related to the concept of agglomeration.\n\nInfrastructure refers to the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise. While infrastructure can play a role in agglomeration, it is not the main concept being tested in this question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) agglomeration.",

            "model_answer": "The majority of workers in periphery countries are likely to be employed in tertiary activities. \n\nExplanation: \n- Primary activities involve agriculture, mining, and other natural resource extraction, which are typically more prevalent in developing countries. \n- Secondary activities involve manufacturing and construction, which may also be common in periphery countries but are not as prevalent as tertiary activities. \n- Tertiary activities involve services such as healthcare, education, finance, and retail, which are often the largest source of employment in developed countries. \n- Quaternary activities involve high-tech industries such as research and development, information technology, and telecommunications, which are less common in periphery countries. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Tertiary.",

It includes a wide range of languages spoken in Europe, India, Iran, and parts of Central Asia, as well as in the Americas, Australia, and other areas where European colonization took place.\n\nThe other language families listed are not as widely spoken in North America and Europe.
