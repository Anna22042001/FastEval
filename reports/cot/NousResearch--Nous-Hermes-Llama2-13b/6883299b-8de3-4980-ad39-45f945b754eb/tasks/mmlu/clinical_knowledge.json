            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the arteries have elastic recoil. \n\nAfter the contraction of the left ventricle, the blood is pumped into the aorta and other vessels. At this point, the atria are relaxed, the right ventricle is also relaxed, and the vessels are not contracted. However, the arteries have elastic recoil, which means that they can stretch and expand when filled with blood. This recoil helps to maintain blood flow through the vessels even after the contraction of the left ventricle. The elastic recoil of the arteries allows them to store energy during the contraction of the left ventricle and release it slowly, preventing a sudden drop in blood pressure and ensuring a continuous flow of blood to the rest of the body.",

            "model_answer": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the overproduction of thyroid hormones, known as hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the presence of antibodies that stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) and the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism.\n\nA) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia - This is true. Graves' disease can cause ophthalmoplegia, which is the paralysis of the extraocular muscles, leading to eye pain, double vision, and inability to move the eyes.\n\nB) It causes a large multi-nodular goitre - This is true. Graves' disease can cause a goiter, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. In some cases, the goiter may be multi-nodular, meaning it is composed of multiple nodules.\n\nC) It is commoner in males than females - This is false. Graves' disease is actually more common in females than in males, with women being 7 to 10 times more likely to develop the condition than men.\n\nD) In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck' - This is true. In the past, Graves' disease was sometimes associated with a condition known as \"Derbyshire neck,\" which is characterized by a thick, cobble-like appearance of the neck due to the presence of multiple thyroid nodules. However, this condition is now rare and is not commonly seen in modern times.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA) It is a cause of ophthalmoplegia",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.\n\nWhen a muscle fibre is stimulated by a nerve impulse, it contracts. However, when the nerve stimulus is removed, the muscle fibre relaxes. This is because the nerve impulse is responsible for sending a signal to the muscle fibre to contract, and without that signal, the muscle fibre returns to its resting state.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. (B) the nerve stimulus is too forceful would imply that the muscle fibre is being overstimulated and is unable to relax, which is not the case. (C) the actin binding sites are uncovered and (D) the actin binding sites are saturated refer to the process of muscle contraction, but they do not explain the relaxation of the muscle fibre.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.",

This results in a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because a fall in the cell concentration of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a result of increased ATP production, not a cause of fatigue.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect because inhibition of ATP production would also lead to a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand, resulting in fatigue.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because lack of skill is not a physiological cause of fatigue during high-intensity exercise. It may be a factor in the inability to perform at a high intensity, but it does not directly cause fatigue.",

During this cycle, acetyl CoA combines with oxaloacetate to form citrate, and then undergoes a series of reactions that generate ATP, NADH, and FADH2.

            "model_answer": "To determine how long it may take for pressure damage to be visible, we need to consider the factors that contribute to pressure damage. Pressure damage, also known as pressure ulcers or bed sores, occur when there is prolonged pressure on the skin, leading to a decrease in blood flow and damage to the tissue.\n\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) has developed a staging system for pressure ulcers, which takes into account the severity of the damage. According to the NIH, stage 1 pressure ulcers can take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours to develop, while stage 4 pressure ulcers can take several days or even weeks to develop.\n\nGiven that the patient has been on the operating table for four hours, it is unlikely that they would already have stage 4 pressure ulcers. Therefore, we can eliminate option (D) 5 days.\n\nBetween options (A) 12 hours and (C) 24 hours, it is difficult to determine which is more likely without additional information about the patient's condition and the specific circumstances of their surgery. However, since pressure ulcers can develop more quickly in some cases, option (A) 12 hours is a possible answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 12 hours.",

During high intensity exercise, phosphocreatine is broken down into creatine and ATP, which provides energy for the muscle to contract. After the exercise is over, the body needs to resynthesize phosphocreatine in order to replenish its energy stores.\n\nThe rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis is dependent on the intensity of the exercise. After very high intensity exercise, the body needs more time to resynthesize phosphocreatine.\n\nWe can eliminate options (A) and (D) because they are not long enough to allow for the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise.\n\nBetween options (B) and (C), we need to consider the fact that the resynthesis of phosphocreatine is a linear process. This means that the rate of resynthesis is constant and does not change over time. Therefore, the longer the time period, the more phosphocreatine can be resynthesized.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the complete resynthesis of phosphocreatine after very high intensity exercise normally takes:\n\n(D) about 4 minutes.",

In spastic paraplegia, there is often a loss of proprioception in the lower limbs, which can lead to difficulties with balance and coordination.\n\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected - Due to the muscle stiffness and weakness, coordination in the legs is often impaired in individuals with spastic paraplegia. This can manifest as an unsteady gait, difficulty with balance, and problems with fine motor skills.\n\n(D) The tone is normal or flaccid - The muscle tone in spastic paraplegia is often increased, leading to muscle stiffness.
