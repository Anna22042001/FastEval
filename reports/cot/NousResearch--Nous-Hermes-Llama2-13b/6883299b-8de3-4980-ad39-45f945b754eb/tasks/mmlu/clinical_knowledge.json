            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the appropriate size of cannula for a rapid blood transfusion, we need to consider several factors. The first is the patient's age, as younger patients typically require smaller cannulas. Secondly, we need to consider the patient's medical history, as patients with weakened veins may require larger cannulas. Finally, we need to consider the urgency of the transfusion, as smaller cannulas may take longer to insert but are less likely to cause complications.\n\nBased on these factors, a healthy adult patient would likely require a cannula size of 18 gauge or 20 gauge. In a situation where a rapid blood transfusion is needed, a healthcare provider might lean towards a larger cannula size, such as 18 gauge, to ensure faster access to the patient's bloodstream.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) 18 gauge.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "In order to determine the key attribute in successful marathon running, we need to consider several factors that contribute to marathon success. Marathon running is a long-distance race that requires endurance, speed, and physical fitness. Therefore, we can eliminate options (A) strength and (B) power as they do not directly relate to the endurance required for marathon running.\n\nStamina, on the other hand, is the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort. In marathon running, stamina is crucial as it allows the runner to maintain a consistent pace for a prolonged period of time. Without a sufficient level of stamina, a runner's performance is likely to decline over the course of the marathon, leading to a slower finishing time.\n\nTherefore, the key attribute in successful marathon running is:\n\n(D) stamina.",

            "correct_answer": 3,

The body relies on both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism to generate energy. During aerobic metabolism, energy is produced through the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen. This process produces a larger amount of energy and is more sustainable.\n\nDuring anaerobic metabolism, energy is produced through the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen. This process produces a smaller amount of energy and is less sustainable. As the number of sprints increases, the body's reliance on aerobic metabolism increases in order to meet the increased energy demand. This is because aerobic metabolism can provide a larger amount of energy and is more sustainable over time. Therefore, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases as the number of sprints increases.",

            "model_answer": "Diplopia, or double vision, is a condition where a person sees two images of a single object. Which statement is true in diplopia?\n\n(A) Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered: This is false. Diplopia can still occur even if one eye is covered. In fact, forced duction tests involve covering one eye and then using manual pressure on the internal or external examination of the covered eye to test for restriction of eye movement.\n\n(B) The outer image is always the false image: This is true. In most cases of diplopia, the image from the lazy eye (the one that has the misalignment) is the outer image, while the image from the fellow eye is the true image. There are exceptions to this, such as in vertical diplopia where the images may be flipped.\n\n(C) A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This is false. A fourth nerve palsy, also known as duane's syndrome, is caused by damage to the fourth cranial nerve, which controls the ability to abduct the eye (move it outward). This can occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma. The onset of diplopia can be sudden or gradual, and it can occur when looking in any direction, not just upwards.\n\n(D) A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: This is true. A sixth nerve palsy, also known as a cranial oculopathy, occurs when there is damage to the sixth cranial nerve, which controls the ability to adduct the eye (move it inward). This can cause a squint, or misalignment of the eyes, in which the affected eye moves outward. If the misalignment is more pronounced when the patient looks upwards or has a divergent direction, it is called a divergent squint.",

This allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle, reducing the acidity and delaying the onset of muscle fatigue. By doing so, sodium bicarbonate helps to maintain optimal pH levels in the muscle, which can lead to improved performance in endurance activities such as middle distance running.",

The CoA part stands for coenzyme A, which is a vital molecule within the fatty acid metabolism pathway. It plays a function in the activation of fatty acids, allowing them to go through oxidation reactions and be damaged down for energy production. The ester bond between the fatty acid and CoA is hydrolyzed by the enzyme thioesterase, releasing the fatty acid for metabolism. Therefore, choice (B) coenzyme A (CoA) is the appropriate answer.",
