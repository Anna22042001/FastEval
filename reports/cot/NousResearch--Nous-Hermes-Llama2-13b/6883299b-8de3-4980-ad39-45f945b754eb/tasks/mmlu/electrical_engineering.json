            "model_answer": "Induction heating takes place in (B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials. \n\nExplanation:\nInduction heating is a process where heat is generated by inducing an electrical current in a conducting material. This is done by placing the material in a magnetic field generated by an alternating current. The material does not need to be magnetic for induction heating to occur, but it must be conducting. Therefore, the answer is (B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "(A) First digit from left to right. \n\nExplanation: \nMSD stands for \"most significant digit\". This term is commonly used in computer science and engineering to refer to the leftmost digit in a binary or decimal number. In a decimal number system, the most significant digit is the one farthest to the left, which has the greatest value and contributes the most to the overall value of the number. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) First digit from left to right.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Both A and B.\n\nDirect core type induction furnaces are used for melting and refining metals. These furnaces require a low frequency supply because of the following reasons:\n\n1. With normal frequency supply (usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz), the electromagnetic forces cause severe stirring action in the molten metal. This stirring action can lead to oxidation and inclusions in the metal, which can degrade the quality of the final product. A low frequency supply reduces this stirring action, allowing the metal to melt and refine more slowly and evenly.\n\n2. Magnetic coupling between the primary and secondary circuit is poor at high frequencies. This means that the energy transfer from the primary coil to the secondary coil is less efficient. A low frequency supply improves magnetic coupling, allowing for more efficient energy transfer and better heating of the metal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Both A and B.",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube. We can do this by integrating the electric displacement over the surface of the cube.\n\nFirst, let's find the electric displacement (D) at a point on the surface of the cube. The electric displacement is given by the formula:\n\nD = \u03b5\u2080 * \u03c3 / r\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2080 is the vacuum permittivity (8.854 x 10^(-12) C\u00b2/Nm\u00b2), \u03c3 is the surface charge density (20 C/m\u00b2), and r is the distance from the point to the surface charge (1 m in this case, since we are considering the surface of the cube).\n\nSo, the electric displacement at a point on the surface of the cube is:\n\nD = (8.854 x 10^(-12) C\u00b2/Nm\u00b2) * (20 C/m\u00b2) / (1 m)\nD = 1.7708 x 10^(-10) C/m\n\nNow, we need to integrate this electric displacement over the surface of the cube. The surface of the cube has an area of 6 m\u00b2 (6 sides, each with an area of 1 m\u00b2).

The force-voltage analogy is based on Ohm's law, which states that the voltage across a resistor is proportional to the current passing through it. In this analogy, the spring can be considered as a resistance, and the force required to compress or extend the spring can be considered as the voltage across the resistance. \n\nHowever, the electrical analogous quantity for spring element (K) in the force-voltage analogy is not a simple resistor value like L, R, 1/C, or C.

The latching current is the minimum current required to turn on the thyristor and hold it in the on state. \n\nIn this case, the holding current is given as 2 mA. To find the latching current, we need to look at the thyristor's characteristics, which typically show the relationship between the current and the voltage across the thyristor. \n\nThe latching current is the current at which the thyristor starts to conduct, and it is usually a few milliamperes lower than the holding current. Therefore, we can estimate that the latching current will be around 1.5 to 2 times lower than the holding current.\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the latching current as follows:\n\nLatching current = Holding current / 2\nLatching current = 2 mA / 2\nLatching current = 1 mA\n\nSo, the latching current of the thyristor is approximately 1 mA.",
