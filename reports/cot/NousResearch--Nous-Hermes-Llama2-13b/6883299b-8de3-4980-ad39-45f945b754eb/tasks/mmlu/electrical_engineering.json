            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) It loads the circuit moderately.\n\nThe potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement involves using a voltmeter in series with a variable resistor (potentiometer) to create a voltage divider circuit. The resistance of the potentiometer is adjusted until the voltmeter reads zero volts, indicating that the output is balanced between the positive and negative supply rails. Since the potentiometer is adjusted to zero out the voltage, the voltage being measured is accurately reported by the voltmeter.\n\nDirect measurement using a voltmeter does not take the internal impedance of the measuring device into account. The voltmeter has an input impedance which may vary with the measurement voltage, leading to errors in the measurement. On the other hand, the potentiometer method compensates for this error by loading the circuit moderately, which ensures accurate measurement without overloading or under loading the circuit.\n\nTherefore, the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter because it loads the circuit moderately.",

            "model_answer": "To find the range of firing angle control for a single phase one pulse controlled circuit, we need to consider the relationship between the firing angle, the inductor current, and the load voltage.\n\nThe general equation for the load voltage in a single phase one pulse controlled circuit is:\n\nV_L = L * (dI/dt)\n\nwhere V_L is the load voltage, L is the inductance, and dI/dt is the rate of change of current with respect to time.\n\nThe counter emf E is given as 200 V, which is equal to the minimum load voltage. Therefore, the maximum rate of change of current (dI/dt) must be such that the load voltage never exceeds 200 V.\n\nNow, we need to consider the source voltage, which is given as 400 sin(314 t). The maximum value of the source voltage is 400 V, so at the maximum rate of change of current, the load voltage must never exceed 400 V.\n\nTo find the maximum rate of change of current, we can differentiate the source voltage equation with respect to time:\n\ndV_S/dt = 314 * 400 * cos(314 t)\n\nSince the maximum rate of change of current must be such that the load voltage never exceeds 400 V, we can equate dV_S/dt and V_L:\n\n314 * 400 * cos(314 t) = L * (dI/dt)\n\nNow, we can solve for the maximum rate of change of current (dI/dt):\n\ndI/dt = (314 * 400 * cos(314 t)) / L\n\nSince the maximum rate of change of current corresponds to the maximum firing angle, we can equate dI/dt to the maximum firing angle:\n\n(314 * 400 * cos(314 t)) / L = V_max\n\nwhere V_max is the maximum rate of change of current.\n\nNow, we know that the maximum rate of change of current must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the source voltage, which is 400 V:\n\n(314 * 400 * cos(314 t)) / L <= 400\n\nThis inequality represents the range of firing angle control for the single phase one pulse controlled circuit. Since we are looking for the range of firing angle control, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the firing angle that satisfy this inequality.\n\nBy solving the inequality, we get:\n\n90\u00b0 <= t <= 180\u00b0\n\nSo, the range of firing angle control for the single phase one pulse controlled circuit is:\n\n(B) 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.",

In other words, both plates have a positive surface charge density.\n\nTo determine the electric field in the gap between the plates, we can use Gauss's law for electric fields. According to Gauss's law, the electric field (E) around a closed surface is equal to the surface charge density (\u03c3) divided by the surface area (A) enclosed by the surface.\n\nSince both plates have the same surface charge density and are parallel, the electric field produced by each plate will be in the same direction and have the same magnitude. Therefore, the electric field in the gap between the plates will be the sum of the electric fields produced by each plate.\n\nLet's denote the surface charge density as \u03c3, the distance between the plates as d, and the distance from the plates as x. Then, the electric field produced by each plate can be given by the formula:\n\nE = \u03c3 / (2\u03c0\u03b5\u2080d)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2080 is the vacuum permittivity constant.\n\nSince both plates have the same surface charge density and are parallel, the electric field produced by each plate will be in the same direction and have the same magnitude.
