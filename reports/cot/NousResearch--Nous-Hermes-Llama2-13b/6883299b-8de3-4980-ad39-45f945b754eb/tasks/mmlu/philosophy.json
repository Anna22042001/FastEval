This means that they are not based on empirical evidence or data, but rather on theoretical reasoning or philosophical assumptions. While there may be some arguments for psychological egoism that refer to neuroscience, are based on controlled studies, or are based on interviews and surveys, Feinberg's claim is that most arguments for this position are not grounded in empirical evidence.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "According to Kant, the supreme principle of morality is synthetic and a priori. \n\nExplanation: \nKant believed that moral principles are synthetic, meaning they involve a combination of concepts and are not simply true by definition. They are also a priori, meaning they are known independently of experience. This means that moral principles are not derived from empirical observations, but are instead based on reason and rationality. The supreme principle of morality, according to Kant, is the categorical imperative, which is a principle that can be understood and applied independently of any specific cultural or historical context.",
