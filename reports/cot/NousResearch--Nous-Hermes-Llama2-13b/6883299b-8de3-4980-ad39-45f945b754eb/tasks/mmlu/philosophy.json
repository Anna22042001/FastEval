            "model_answer": "Aesthetics deals with objects that are (C) not essential to our existence. Aesthetics refers to the concept of beauty and the appreciation of art, design, and nature. While some aspects of aesthetics, such as functionality, may be essential to our existence, the focus of aesthetics is not on the basic needs for survival but rather on the enhancement of our environment and experience through visual and sensory pleasures. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) not essential to our existence.",

            "model_answer": "According to Socrates, the unexamined life is a tragedy because it results in grievous harm to the soul. \n\nExplanation: Socrates believed that the soul is the most important part of a person, and that it is through self-reflection and examination that one can achieve wisdom and virtue. Without this examination, a person is not able to truly understand themselves or their place in the world, leading to a life that is empty or misguided, and ultimately harm to the soul.

            "model_answer": "According to Kant's categorical imperative, the only thing that can be called \"good\" without qualification is a good will. A good will is defined as a will that acts in accordance with the moral law, even when it is not in the agent's best interest to do so.\n\nThis is because, for Kant, morality is not about achieving certain outcomes or producing good consequences, but rather about acting in a way that is consistent with the moral law for its own sake. Therefore, the only thing that can be considered intrinsically good is a good will.\n\nAnswer: (D) a good will.",

This means that we should be concerned not only with our own actions, but also with the actions of others and the impact they have on the world around us.\n\nOption (A) states that modest changes to our personal habits are all that is needed. While this may be true for some individuals, it does not take into account the impact that our society as a whole has on suffering. For example, if we continue to consume products that are produced in sweatshops or support policies that perpetuate poverty, our personal changes may not have a significant impact on reducing suffering.\n\nOption (B) suggests that modest changes to our personal habits, as well as changes to society, are necessary. This is a more comprehensive approach, as it recognizes that individual action alone is not enough to address the issue of suffering. We must also work to change societal norms and structures that contribute to suffering.\n\nOption (C) states that drastic changes to our personal habits, but not to our society, are required. While this may be true for some individuals, it does not take into account the broader context in which we live.
