This is different from a false cause fallacy, which occurs when someone assumes that because two events are correlated, one must have caused the other. False cause fallacies can take many forms, but a specific type of false cause fallacy that argues that since two events happened at the same time, one event must have caused the other is a false analogy fallacy.
