            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts. \n\nExplanation: \nAppellate courts are courts that review decisions of lower courts. Their primary function is to ensure that the legal system is fair and just by reviewing the decisions of lower courts for errors in law or fact. Appellate judges do not decide the facts of a case, but rather review the decision of the lower court to determine if it was correct. Appellate trials are also not jury trials, as they involve a review of the record of the lower court proceeding, rather than a new trial. Finally, appellate judges do use the stare decisis principle, which means that they are bound by the decisions of higher courts in similar cases.",

However, this power is not granted specifically by the Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 or Executive Order 8248. \n\nThe White House Office, on the other hand, is a staff office that supports the president in carrying out their duties. The Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248 both grant the president the power to select the staff for the White House Office. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) White House Office.",

            "question": "While ratifying the Constitution, the primary point of disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists was over\n\n(A) whether representation in Congress should be equal among states or proportional to population\n(B) the strength of the federal government relative to the states\n(C) the future of the slave trade\n(D) whether people had inalienable rights",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) the strength of the federal government relative to the states.\n\nThe disagreement between Federalists and Anti-Federalists during the ratification of the Constitution was primarily over the balance of power between the federal government and the states. Federalists, led by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, argued for a strong central government that could effectively regulate commerce and address national security concerns. They believed that a strong federal government was necessary to prevent the chaos and anarchy that could result from a weak central authority.\n\nOn the other hand, Anti-Federalists, led by Thomas Jefferson and George Mason, were concerned that a strong central government would lead to the oppression of individual states and the erosion of their rights. They argued for a more decentralized system, with greater power reserved for the states. They believed that the states should have the ability to govern themselves and that a strong federal government would lead to the consolidation of power in the hands of a few elites.\n\nThe disagreement over the strength of the federal government relative to the states was a central issue in the ratification debate and ultimately shaped the structure of the American government.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The Dred Scott decision of 1857 was overturned by the (D) Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nExplanation: \nThe Dred Scott decision was a Supreme Court case that ruled that African Americans could not be considered citizens of the United States and therefore had no rights to sue in court. This decision was widely criticized and was a major factor in the lead-up to the Civil War. \n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, was part of the Reconstruction Amendments that were added to the Constitution after the Civil War. One of the main purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment was to grant citizenship and equal rights to all people born or naturalized in the United States, including African Americans. \n\nBy granting citizenship and equal rights to all people, the Fourteenth Amendment effectively overturned the Dred Scott decision and its assertion that African Americans could not be considered citizens with rights.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The principle realized when the federal government provides most of the funding to a project in which multiple levels of government work together is (B) Fiscal federalism. \n\nFiscal federalism refers to the division of financial responsibilities between different levels of government. In this case, the federal government is providing most of the funding for the project, which means that the financial responsibility lies primarily with the federal government. This arrangement allows for multiple levels of government to work together on a project, sharing the costs and benefits associated with it. This principle is different from (A) Confederation, which refers to a form of government in which multiple states or regions are loosely united under a central government. It is also different from (C) Grant-based funding, which refers to the practice of providing financial assistance to recipients through grants, and (D) Dual federalism, which refers to a system in which the federal and state governments each have their own set of responsibilities and powers.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) The court helps set the public agenda by deciding which appeals to hear.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States and has the power to hear cases that raise important constitutional questions or that have national significance. However, the court receives thousands of appeals each year, and it cannot hear all of them. Therefore, the court must decide which cases to hear, and this process is known as \"setting the docket.\"\n\nThe court's ability to set its own agenda means that it can choose cases that are likely to have a significant impact on the law or on society as a whole. This power allows the court to shape the legal landscape and to address issues that are important to the country.\n\nThe other options are incorrect. (A) is incorrect because the court does not rule on every case appealed to it. Instead, it must decide which cases to hear. (C) is incorrect because the court does not hear all cases when two or more justices agree that the case has merit. Instead, the justices must still decide which cases to hear. (D) is incorrect because the chief justice's vote counts as only one vote.",

The No Child Left Behind Act is a law passed by the United States Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. It established educational standards that states must meet to receive federal educational funding, which means that states are required to follow these standards in order to receive federal money.

However, based on research and data analysis, it is likely that the most common reason people join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong is due to:\n\n(A) peer pressure.\n\nPeer pressure can play a significant role in shaping an individual's political views and affiliations. When individuals are surrounded by peers who hold different political beliefs and affiliations, they may feel pressure to conform to those beliefs and affiliations in order to fit in and maintain social connections.\n\nWhile economic issues, religious beliefs, and pressure from employers can also influence an individual's political affiliation, peer pressure is often the most significant factor, as it can shape an individual's identity and sense of belonging within a social group.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) peer pressure.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) House members may serve on only one committee at a time. \n\nReasoning: \n\nHouse members are more concerned about their committee assignments than are senators because they may serve on only one committee at a time. This means that House members have a limited number of opportunities to influence legislation and have a say in the policy-making process. In contrast, senators can serve on multiple committees and have more opportunities to impact legislation. \n\nAdditionally, House committees have more power to shape legislation than Senate committees, as bills in the Senate must pass through all committees before reaching the floor. This means that House members have a greater opportunity to influence legislation before it reaches the Senate. \n\nThe rules in the House also make it easier for representatives to influence legislation on the floor, as they have more opportunities to debate and amend bills. This is in contrast to the Senate, where the rules make it more difficult for senators to alter legislation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) House members may serve on only one committee at a time.",
