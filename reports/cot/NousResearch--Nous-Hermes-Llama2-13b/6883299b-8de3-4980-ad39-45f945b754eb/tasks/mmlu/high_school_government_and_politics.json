            "question": "Which of the following best describes the balance the Supreme Court has struck between the establishment clause and the free-exercise clause?\n\n(A) Freedom of speech is protected except in certain situations, such as yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theater.\n(B) Once a church has been recognized by the federal government, its tax-exempt status can never be revoked.\n(C) Once Congress has created an administrative agency, that agency can be dissolved only by a constitutional amendment.\n(D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) State-sponsored prayer during school hours is prohibited, but voluntary prayer by student groups before school is allowed. \n\nThe establishment clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another. The free-exercise clause, on the other hand, guarantees the freedom to practice one's religion freely. The Supreme Court has struck a balance between these two clauses by allowing voluntary religious expression, such as prayer, while prohibiting state-sponsored religious activities, such as state-sanctioned prayer during school hours. This balance ensures that religious freedom is protected while preventing the government from endorsing or favoring one religion over another.",

            "model_answer": "The statement (B) A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout is not accurate. The data clearly shows that the opposite is true. According to a study by the Pew Research Center,higher educational attainment is associated with higher levels of voter turnout. Individuals with a college degree or higher are more likely to vote than those with less education. While high school dropouts have lower levels of voter turnout than those with a GED, they still have lower levels of voter turnout than college graduates. Therefore, statement (B) does not accurately describe voting behavior in the United States. I hope this helps!",

            "model_answer": "It is difficult to determine the exact significance of each factor mentioned in forming a child's political views as they can all play a role. However, based on research and sociological studies, the most significant factor is likely to be the child's family. \n\nChildren tend to adopt the political views of their parents, and family environment plays a crucial role in shaping a child's attitudes, beliefs, and values. Parents can pass down their political ideologies, socialization practices, and influence their children through their discussions and interactions.\n\n(D) The child's religion may also play a role in shaping political views, as people tend to align themselves with political parties and policies that align with their religious beliefs.\n\n(C) The media to which the child is exposed can also have an impact, particularly as children grow older and become more exposed to various forms of media. The media can introduce children to new ideas and opinions, and shape their understanding of current events and political issues. However, the influence of the media may not be as significant as that of the family.\n\n(A) The geographical area in which the child grows up can also play a role, particularly if the area is politically homogenous. Growing up in an area where a specific political ideology is predominant can shape a child's views. However, the influence of the geographical area may be less significant than the influence of family and religion.\n\nTherefore, the most significant factor in forming a child's political views is (D) The child's religion, followed by (B) The child's family, then (C) The media to which the child is exposed, and finally (A) The geographical area in which the child grows up.",
