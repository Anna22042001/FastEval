            "question": "Do individuals (physical) persons enjoy international legal personality in the same manner as States and international organisations?\n\n(A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited\n(B) Individuals enjoy unlimited international legal personality\n(C) Individuals do not enjoy any international legal personality\n(D) Individuals can only bring claims before international courts",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the ability of an entity to exercise rights and duties under international law. States and international organizations enjoy full international legal personality, which means they can exercise rights and duties in their own name and can enter into agreements with other States or organizations.\n\nHowever, individuals do not enjoy the same level of international legal personality. While individuals can still exercise certain rights and duties under international law, these rights are limited. For example, individuals can bring claims before international courts or tribunals, but they cannot enter into agreements with other States or organizations in their own name.\n\nAdditionally, individuals can only exercise certain rights and duties under international law if they are recognized by the relevant international organization or State. This means that the international community can limit the rights and duties of individuals based on their own policies and preferences.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.",

This means that the group has certain rights that are distinct from the rights of its individual members. For example, a minority group may have collective rights that protect their cultural identity and traditions, which are separate from the individual rights of the members of the group. Collective rights are often seen as important for protecting the interests of minority groups, and for promoting social justice and equality.",

            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' refers to the idea that the European Convention on Human Rights is a living document that must be interpreted in a way that reflects the changing needs of society. This principle allows the European Court of Human Rights to interpret the Convention in a flexible manner, so that it can adapt to new situations and address evolving human rights concerns.\n\n(A) Golder v UK (1978) - This case established the principle that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that reflects the changing needs of society, and that the Court must have the power to develop and adapt the law to meet those changing needs.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009) - This case concerned the right to life and the use of lethal force by police officers. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that reflects the changing needs of society, and that the Court must have the power to develop and adapt the law to meet those changing needs.\n\n(C) Goodwin v UK (2002) - This case concerned the right to a fair trial and the use of hearsay evidence. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that reflects the changing needs of society, and that the Court must have the power to develop and adapt the law to meet those changing needs.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998) - This case concerned the right to life and the duty of care owed by police officers. The Court held that the Convention must be interpreted in a way that reflects the changing needs of society, and that the Court must have the power to develop and adapt the law to meet those changing needs.\n\nTherefore, all of the cases listed illustrate the 'living instrument principle' used by the European Court of Human Rights.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law. \n\nExplanation: \nThe doctrine of incorporation is a principle of constitutional law in the United States that holds that certain provisions of the Bill of Rights, which are parts of the United States Constitution, are applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that these rights are incorporated into the legal system of each state, making them binding on state and local governments.\n\nIn the context of treaties, the doctrine of incorporation suggests that once a treaty is ratified by the United States Senate and signed by the President, it becomes part of the United States' obligations under international law. The treaty is then incorporated into domestic law through the President's power to execute the laws, and it becomes binding on all branches of the federal government, as well as state and local governments to the extent that it is applicable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(D) The doctrine of incorporation suggests that ratified treaties automatically pass into the sphere of domestic law.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\n\nInternational legal personality refers to the status of an entity under international law, which determines whether it can exercise rights and duties under international law. Entities with international legal personality are considered subjects of international law and have the capacity to enforce their rights and duties by or against the relevant actor. This status is usually granted to states, but can also be granted to other entities such as international organizations, individuals, and even corporations in certain circumstances.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because it suggests that only states have international legal personality, which is not the case.\nOption (C) is incorrect because it suggests that an entity can challenge the authority of states, which is not a direct consequence of having international legal personality.\nOption (D) is incorrect because it suggests that international legal personality is a term used to denote legal, as opposed to physical, persons under international law, which is true, but does not fully capture the meaning of the term.",

Therefore, it is unlikely that the ICJ would be receptive to the idea that an armed attack may arise through a series of lower intensity, yet cumulative, instances of armed force.
