            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) They provide access to phosphorus, an essential element that is limited in many kinds of soils.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, where the fungi help the plant access nutrients in the soil. One of the primary benefits they confer to many plants is access to phosphorus, an essential element that is often limited in the soil. The fungi are able to break down complex organic compounds in the soil, releasing phosphorus that the plant can then use for growth and development. This is particularly important in nutrient-poor soils, where the plant may otherwise struggle to obtain enough phosphorus to thrive.",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement concerning the Golgi apparatus of a eukaryote is:\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\n\nThe Golgi apparatus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells that plays a crucial role in the processing, modification, and sorting of proteins and lipids. It is composed of a series of flattened membrane-bound sacs called cisternae.\n\nThe statement (D) correctly describes the function of the Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation is the process by which carbohydrates are added to proteins or lipids, often to form glycoproteins or glycolipids. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for the glycosylation of certain secretory proteins, which means that these proteins are modified with carbohydrates before they enter the Golgi apparatus. This modification is essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of the proteins.\n\nThe other statements (A), (B), and (C) are also correct, but they describe different aspects of the Golgi apparatus:\n\n(A) The Golgi apparatus is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. The cis face is the side of the Golgi apparatus that receives proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum, while the trans face is the side that sends the modified proteins and lipids to their final destinations.\n\n(B) The Golgi apparatus is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. These vesicles contain the proteins and lipids that have been processed and modified by the Golgi apparatus and are ready to be transported to their final destinations, such as the plasma membrane or other organelles.\n\n(C) The composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are continuous with one another. This means that the proteins and lipids move through the Golgi apparatus in a sequential manner, from the cis face to the trans face, where they are sorted and packaged into vesicles for transport.",

One of these sperm cells fuses with the egg cell (ovule) to form the zygote, which will develop into the embryo. The second sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei in the central cell of the ovule, which will develop into the megagametophyte. \n\nThe megagametophyte is the female gametophyte that develops from the fertilization of the two polar nuclei. It is responsible for the development of the archegonium, which is a structure that produces the egg cell. The megagametophyte also nourishes the developing embryo and provides a site for the fusion of the sperm cell and the egg cell. \n\nThe other options listed are not correct because they refer to different structures or processes that occur during the development of the seed plant.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site.\n\nA competitive inhibitor works by binding to the active site of an enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding to the enzyme. However, the inhibitor does not form covalent links with the enzyme or modify its amino acid residues. Instead, it competes with the substrate for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site. This means that the inhibitor and substrate are both trying to bind to the enzyme, but the inhibitor is less specific and can bind to a different site on the enzyme.\n\nWhen the inhibitor binds to the enzyme, it reduces the enzyme's activity because the substrate cannot bind to the active site. The inhibitor can be removed from the enzyme by increasing the concentration of the substrate, which will outcompete the inhibitor for the enzyme's active site.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) competing with the substrate molecule for the same enzyme but a different binding site than the substrate binding site.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n\nThe reason for this is that the sperm receptor proteins are specifically designed to bind to ZP3, not ZP2. If the sperm are exposed to ZP2 instead of ZP3, they will not recognize it as a binding target and will not aggregate on the beads. This does not disrupt the normal process of in vitro fertilization, as the sperm would still be able to bind to the zona pellucida of the egg, which contains ZP3.\n\nThe other options would be expected to disrupt the in vitro fertilization process:\n\n(A) Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization because the antibodies would bind to the ZP3 on the egg's surface, preventing the sperm from binding and initiating the acrosomal reaction.\n(B) Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization because the sperm would already have bound to the ZP3, initiating the acrosomal reaction, and would be less likely to bind to the zona pellucida of the egg.\n(C) Incubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization for the same reason as option (A), the antibodies would bind to the ZP3 on the egg's surface, preventing the sperm from binding and initiating the acrosomal reaction.",
