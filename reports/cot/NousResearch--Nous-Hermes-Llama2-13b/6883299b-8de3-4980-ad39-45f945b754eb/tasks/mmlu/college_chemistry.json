            "model_answer": "The true statement about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands is:\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image, also known as enantiomers. In complexes containing achiral ligands, the ligands themselves are not chiral and do not contribute to the overall chirality of the complex. However, the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion can lead to the formation of enantiomers.\n\nSquare planar complexes (A) can display optical isomerism if the ligands are different, as the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion can lead to the formation of enantiomers.\n\nTetrahedral complexes (B) can also display optical isomerism if the ligands are different, as the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion can lead to the formation of enantiomers.\n\nLinear complexes (C) can display optical isomerism if both ligands are different, as the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion can lead to the formation of enantiomers.\n\nOctahedral complexes of monodentate ligands (D) can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands, as the arrangement of the ligands around the central metal ion can lead to the formation of enantiomers. This is because the complex can have two different sets of three ligands arranged in an octahedral geometry, leading to the formation of enantiomers.",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider the neutron number (N) and the atomic number (Z) of the element manganese.\n\nManganese has an atomic number of 25, which means it has 25 protons in its nucleus. The nuclide we are considering is 55Mn, which means it has 55 - 25 = 30 neutrons.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of energy levels allowed by the quantum mechanical rules. This is given by the formula:\n\nE = h^2 / (8 * pi^2 * m * R^2)\n\nwhere E is the energy, h is the Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and R is the Rydberg constant.\n\nFor an electron in a hydrogen-like atom, the energy levels are given by:\n\nE_n = -13.6 eV / n^2\n\nwhere n is the principal quantum number.\n\nSince we have 30 neutrons, the electron will be in the 1s orbital, which corresponds to n = 1. Therefore, the energy level for the 55Mn nuclide is:\n\nE_1 = -13.6 eV / 1^2 = -13.6 eV\n\nSince the energy level is negative, it means that the electron is bound to the nucleus.\n\nNow, we need to determine the number of allowed energy levels. For a hydrogen-like atom, the number of allowed energy levels is infinite, as the electron can occupy any principal quantum number n. However, for a heavier nucleus like manganese, the energy levels are quantized, and the electron can only occupy specific energy levels.\n\nTherefore, the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide is infinite.

The area under each line in the 1H spectrum is proportional to the concentration of the corresponding compound. Let's denote the concentration of DMSO as [DMSO] and the concentration of AN as [AN].\n\nSince the lines have relative intensities \u03b1 and 3\u03b1, respectively, we can write the following equation:\n\n(Area of DMSO line) / (Area of AN line) = (Concentration of DMSO) / (Concentration of AN)\n\nLet's assume that the total area under the two lines is A. Then, we can write:\n\nA = \u03b1 * Area of DMSO line + 3\u03b1 * Area of AN line\n\nNow, let's assume that the total concentration of the mixture is C. Then, we can write:\n\nC = [DMSO] + [AN]\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for A in terms of the areas of the lines and the concentrations of DMSO and AN:\n\nA = \u03b1 * Area of DMSO line + 3\u03b1 * Area of AN line\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for C in terms of the concentrations of DMSO and AN:\n\nC = [DMSO] + [AN]\n\nNow, we can equate the two expressions for A:\n\n\u03b1 * Area of DMSO line + 3\u03b1 * Area of AN line = \u03b1 * Area of DMSO line + 3\u03b1 * Area of AN line\n\nSince the areas of the lines are proportional to their concentrations, we can conclude that the ratio of the two concentrations is 1:3.
