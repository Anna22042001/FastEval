            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "According to Hourdequin, individualism leads us into two problems. The first problem is that it leads to failures of developing integration and integrality. This means that when we focus too much on our individualism, we may neglect the importance of building relationships and connections with others, which can lead to a lack of integration and integrality in our society.\nThe second problem is that individualism leads us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and instills in us an atomistic view of persons. This means that when we focus too much on our individual rights and freedoms, we may neglect the common good and the needs of others, leading to a situation where everyone overuses a shared resource, resulting in its depletion. Additionally, this mindset can lead us to see others as isolated individuals rather than as part of a larger community, which can further contribute to social and environmental problems.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n(A) It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.\n(B) They lead us into \"tragedy of the commons\" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.",

            "model_answer": "Philippa Foot explains the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction by appealing to (C) both A and B. \n\nExplanation:\nFoot argues that there is a moral difference between killing someone and letting them die. She believes that we have a duty to help those in need, and that this duty is violated when we actively kill someone. However, she also believes that we have a right to noninterference, which means that we should not interfere with someone's life unless they are in need of help. \n\nTherefore, the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction lies in the balance between our duty to help those in need and our right to noninterference. This balance is reflected in both A and B, which are the rights of noninterference and rights to goods and services, respectively. So, the correct answer is (C) both A and B.",

Kant believes that sexual objectification sacrifices humanity, but Papadaki disagrees with this notion. \n\nPapadaki argues that Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity. This means that Papadaki does not agree with Kant's view that sexual objectification is a violation of humanity. Instead, Papadaki likely believes that sexual objectification is not inherently wrong or harmful, or that it can be justified in some way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Kant is wrong to think about the wrong of sexual objectification in terms of humanity.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To determine the best approach to consider Sandel's case against moral engineering, we need to examine the different philosophical approaches mentioned in the options.\n\n(A) A Kantian approach: Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy is based on the categorical imperative, which states that we should act only in accordance with rules that we would want to be universal law. In this context, a Kantian approach would argue that moral engineering goes against the idea of treating people as ends rather than means, and that it tries to control people's behavior through external means rather than promoting intrinsic moral values.\n\n(B) An application of the ethics of prima facie duty: This approach, as developed by W.D. Ross, focuses on the idea of prima facie duties, which are duties that we have in general situations, but may be overridden by other duties in specific circumstances. In this context, an application of the ethics of prima facie duty would argue that moral engineering may interfere with our prima facie duties to respect autonomy and promote well-being.\n\n(C) A virtue ethics approach: Virtue ethics, as developed by Aristotle and other ancient Greek philosophers, focuses on the development of virtues or moral character traits as the basis for moral action. In this context, a virtue ethics approach would argue that moral engineering goes against the idea of cultivating moral character and promoting virtues such as self-control and responsibility.\n\n(D) A natural law theory approach: Natural law theory, as developed by philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and John Locke, is based on the idea that there are certain natural laws or principles that are inherent in human nature and that guide moral action. In this context, a natural law theory approach would argue that moral engineering goes against the idea of respecting natural human inclinations and promoting human flourishing.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the best approach to consider Sandel's case against moral engineering is (B) an application of the ethics of prima facie duty. This is because it focuses on the specific duties and responsibilities that arise in the context of moral engineering, and how they may be overridden by other considerations.",
