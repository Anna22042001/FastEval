            "model_answer": "To estimate the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we can consider several factors such as the population, movie-watching habits, and the availability of streaming services.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the estimated population of the United States in 2020 was around 332 million people. With the availability of streaming services, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of the population watches movies at home.\n\nIn addition, according to a study by the Motion Picture Association, the average American watches more than 3 hours of movies and TV shows per day, which translates to approximately 1,095 hours per year. Assuming that a significant portion of this time is spent watching movies, we can estimate the number of movies watched per person per year.\n\nTaking these factors into account, we can estimate that the number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year is approximately:\n\n(C) 20,000,000,000\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 20,000,000,000.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine how much energy is wasted per year by throwing out unused ice in drinks. \n\nAssuming that each American throws out an average of one glass of ice per day, and that each glass contains about 100 grams of ice, we can calculate the total amount of ice thrown out in a year. \n\nThere are approximately 365 days in a year, so over the course of a year, an American would throw out:\n\n(100 grams/glass) * (365 days/year) = 36,500 grams of ice per year\n\nNow, we need to convert this amount of ice into energy. The specific heat capacity of ice is 2.1 J/g\u00b0C. To calculate the energy wasted, we need to know the temperature difference between the ice and the surrounding environment. Let's assume that the ice is thrown out when it has reached room temperature, which is approximately 25\u00b0C.\n\nThe energy required to raise the temperature of the ice from 0\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C is:\n\n(36,500 grams) * (2.1 J/g\u00b0C) * (25\u00b0C - 0\u00b0C) = 2,062,500 J\n\nTherefore, Americans waste approximately 2,062,500 J of energy per year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks. \n\nThe answer is:\n(C) 6*10^14 J",
