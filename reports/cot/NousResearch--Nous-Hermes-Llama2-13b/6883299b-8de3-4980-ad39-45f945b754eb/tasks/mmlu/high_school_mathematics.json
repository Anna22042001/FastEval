Since the sequence is of consecutive odd integers, we can write the first few terms as follows:\n\n1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...\n\nNow, let's assume that the number of terms in the sequence is 'n'. According to the sum of arithmetic sequence formula:\n\nSum = (n * (2a + (n - 1)d)) / 2\n\nWe are given that the sum of the arithmetic sequence is 240, so:\n\n240 = (n * (2a + (n - 1)d)) / 2\n\nNow, we want to find the number of terms 'n' such that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers summing to 240. Since the first term is odd, 'a' must be odd as well. Therefore, 'a' can be written as '2k + 1', where k is an integer.\n\nSubstituting 'a' into the sum of arithmetic sequence formula:\n\n240 = (n * ((2k + 1) + (n - 1)d)) / 2\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n240 = (n * (2k + n * d - 1)) / 2\n\nNow, we can see that k and n are related, so we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nk = (240 * 2) / (2 * (2k + n * d - 1))\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nk = 120 / (2k + n * d - 1)\n\nSince k is an integer, we can conclude that n * d - 1 must also be an integer.
