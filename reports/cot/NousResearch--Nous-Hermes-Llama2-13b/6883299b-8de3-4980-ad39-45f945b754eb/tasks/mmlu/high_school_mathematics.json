The area of this triangle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.

Since she started spinning clockwise, spinning 2250 degrees to her right will make her face to the left.\n\nTo determine the direction she is facing, we need to convert the angle of her initial spin to degrees and compare it to the angle of a full circle (360 degrees). \n\n2250 degrees is greater than 360 degrees, which means she has completed more than one full circle.
