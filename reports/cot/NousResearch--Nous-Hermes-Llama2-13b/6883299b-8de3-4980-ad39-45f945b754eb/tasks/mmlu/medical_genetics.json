Initially, it was believed that there were around 100,000 genes. However, with advancements in technology and research, it was found that there were only around 20,000 to 25,000 protein-coding genes. This estimate has been revised multiple times and is still a subject of ongoing research. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 19,000\u201320,000.",

However, genome-wide association studies have only been able to account for a small percentage of this variation. \n\nWe can eliminate option (B) as it is less than 1%, which is not possible since the heritability of body mass index is greater than 50%. \n\nBetween options (A) and (C), we can compare the percentage of variation explained by known SNPs in genome-wide association studies to the percentage of variation explained by heritability in twin and family studies. Since the percentage in twin and family studies is greater than 50%, and the percentage in genome-wide association studies is less than 50%, we can eliminate option (A). \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(D) less than 2%",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and brain, which can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological problems.\n\nIf a mother has untreated PKU, her body is unable to process phenylalanine properly, and this can lead to a higher concentration of phenylalanine in her blood. When a mother with untreated PKU becomes pregnant, the increased levels of phenylalanine can cross the placenta and affect the developing fetus.\n\nThe risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU depends on the severity of the mother's PKU and the timing of treatment. If the mother's PKU is severe and goes untreated throughout pregnancy, the risk of abnormality in the child is almost 100% (D). This is because the high levels of phenylalanine in the mother's blood can lead to severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, and other severe neurological problems in the fetus.\n\nIf the mother's PKU is mild or moderate and she receives treatment during pregnancy, the risk of abnormality in the child is significantly lower. In this case, the risk of abnormality would be less than 100% (B). Early diagnosis and treatment of PKU in pregnant women can help to reduce the risk of abnormality in the child.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(B) 10%",

This is done by comparing the phenotypes of individuals in a genetic cross, such as a F2 population, and mapping the trait's expression to specific regions on the chromosomes. QTL analysis is particularly useful for studying complex traits that are influenced by multiple genes and have a continuous distribution, as opposed to simple Mendelian traits that are determined by a single gene with two or more alleles.",

It is a mobile genetic element that can move from one bacterial chromosome to another, allowing for the transfer of genetic material between bacteria. The Hfr strain of E. coli is a high-frequency recombination strain that has the ability to transfer the F factor to other bacteria, which can then incorporate the F factor into their own chromosomes.\n\nThe other options listed are not correct for the Hfr strain of E. coli. Option (A) refers to a vector, which is a piece of DNA that is used to transfer genetic material between organisms, but it is not specific to the Hfr strain. Option (B) and (D) refer to the insertion of a human gene or a human chromosome, respectively, which is not relevant to the Hfr strain of E. coli.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.",

It is caused by mutations in the MT-ND1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5 genes, which are located in the mitochondrial DNA. These genes are responsible for encoding proteins that are essential for the proper functioning of the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing organelles in cells.

            "model_answer": "The inbreeding coefficient, F, represents the proportion of mating between close relatives in a population. An increase in the inbreeding coefficient is likely to result in a higher proportion of genes that show linkage. This is because linkage occurs when two or more genes are located close together on a chromosome and are inherited together. When there is a higher proportion of close relatives mating, the chances of genes being inherited together increase, leading to a higher likelihood of linkage. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage.",

The most common form of \u03b1-thalassaemia is caused by a deletion of three nucleotides (codon \u03b26) in the HBA1 gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation and the production of an abnormal, nonfunctional \u03b1-globin chain.
