We can use the formula for the range of a normal distribution:\n\nRange = Mean \u00b1 (Z-score * Standard Deviation)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is 1.96 (from the standard normal distribution table).\n\nRange = $155 \u00b1 (1.96 * $32)\nRange = $155 \u00b1 $62.56\n\nNow, we can find the lower and upper bounds of the range:\n\nLower Bound = $155 - $62.56 = $92.44\nUpper Bound = $155 + $62.56 = $217.56\n\nSo, we can say that we are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $92.44 and $217.56. This means that 95% of the donations fall within this range.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate statement is:\n\n(C) We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.",

This means that the median will be closer to the moderately paid teachers' salaries, which is what the teachers' union wants to emphasize.\n\nThe mean, on the other hand, would be influenced by the highly paid administrators and could result in a higher average salary that the district might use to justify paying less. The mode would only give the value that appears most frequently in the dataset, which might not be relevant to the current negotiations. The standard deviation would provide information about the spread of the salaries, but it might not be as relevant to the negotiations as the median.\n\nTherefore, the teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations.",

The width of the confidence interval is determined by the sample size and the desired level of confidence. \n\nIn general, a larger sample size leads to a narrower confidence interval because it provides a more accurate estimate of the population parameter. This is because the larger sample size reduces the margin of error, which is the difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter. \n\nAdditionally, a 95% confidence level is more conservative than a 99% confidence level.
