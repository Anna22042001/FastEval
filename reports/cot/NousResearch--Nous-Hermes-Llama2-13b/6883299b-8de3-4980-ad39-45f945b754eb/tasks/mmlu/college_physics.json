            "model_answer": "To find the total mechanical energy of the system, we need to consider both the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the mass.\n\nAt the moment the mass passes through its equilibrium position, its speed is 0.040 m/s. We can use this to find the kinetic energy (KE) of the mass:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\nKE = 0.5 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2\nKE = 0.0024 J\n\nNow, we need to find the potential energy (PE) of the mass. Since the spring is massless, we can use Hooke's Law to find the spring constant (k):\n\nk = 0.5 * m * v^2\nk = 0.5 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2\nk = 0.0024 J/m\n\nThe potential energy of the mass can be found using the formula:\n\nPE = k * x\nPE = 0.0024 J/m * 0.030 m\nPE = 0.00072 J\n\nNow, we can find the total mechanical energy (TME) of the system by adding the kinetic energy and the potential energy:\n\nTME = KE + PE\nTME = 0.0024 J + 0.00072 J\nTME = 0.00312 J\n\nTo convert the total mechanical energy to mJ, we can use the conversion factor 1 J = 0.001 mJ:\n\nTME = 0.00312 J * (1 mJ / 0.001 J)\nTME = 0.0312 mJ\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.0312 mJ.",

The index of refraction for water is given in a unitless ratio, so we'll assume it's 1.33. The index of refraction for oil is given in units of nm/m, so we'll convert it to the same unitless ratio:\n\nn1 = 1.33\nn2 = 1.5 * (1 nm / 1000 nm) = 1.5 / 1000 = 0.0015\n\nNow, let's find the angle of reflection:\n\n\u03b82 = 0 + 2 * (0.0015 - 1.33) * 500 * 10^(-9)\n\u03b82 = 0 + 2 * (-1.3285) * 500 * 10^(-9)\n\u03b82 = -1.3285 * 500 * 10^(-9) radians\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the reflection of light at an interface between two media to find the most strongly reflected wavelength:\n\nn1 * sin(\u03b81) = n2 * sin(\u03b82)\n\nsin(0) = sin(-1.3285 * 500 * 10^(-9))\n\nSince sin(0) = 0, all wavelengths will be reflected equally strongly at the interface.
