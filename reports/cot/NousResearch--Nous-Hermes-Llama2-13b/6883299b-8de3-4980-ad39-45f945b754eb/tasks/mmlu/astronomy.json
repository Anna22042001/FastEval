            "model_answer": "There are different types of supernovae, and one of them is the type-Ia supernova. To determine which statement is true for a type-Ia supernova, let's examine each option:\n\n(A) This type occurs in binary systems. - FALSE. While type-Ia supernovae do occur in binary systems, not all supernovae in binary systems are type-Ia. So, this statement is not true for a type-Ia supernova.\n\n(B) This type occurs in young galaxies. - TRUE. Type-Ia supernovae occur in relatively young galaxies, usually less than 10 billion years old. This is because type-Ia supernovae are responsible for the creation of elements in stars, and young galaxies have not yet had enough time for such processes to occur.\n\n(C) This type produces gamma-ray bursts. - FALSE. While some supernovae produce gamma-ray bursts, type-Ia supernovae do not. Gamma-ray bursts are typically produced by the collapse of massive stars, or the merger of neutron stars. So, this statement is not true for a type-Ia supernova.\n\n(D) This type produces high amounts of X-rays. - FALSE. Type-Ia supernovae do not produce high amounts of X-rays. They emit mostly optical and infrared light, with some ultraviolet light. So, this statement is also not true for a type-Ia supernova.\n\nTherefore, the only true statement for a type-Ia supernova is option (B) - \"This type occurs in young galaxies.\"",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and interacts with the molecules present in the air. The blue color of the sky is caused by the short wavelength blue light being scattered more than other colors. As a result, the blue light gets dispersed in all directions, making the sky appear blue. Other colors present in sunlight, such as red and yellow, have longer wavelengths, and they are not scattered as much as blue light, which is why they are not as prominent in the sky. So the correct answer is (C) Because the atmosphere preferentially scatters short wavelengths.",

However, in the case of this theory, it is difficult to prove it because it is a broad statement that encompasses all objects. \nTo prove that there is an attractive force between all objects would require testing every possible object in every possible situation, which is impossible.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Since the comet impacts the earth at the minimum impact speed, we can assume that the relative velocity between the comet and the earth is negligible. Therefore, we can treat the comet as a particle of mass m that transfers all its kinetic energy to the earth.\n\nThe total energy released in the impact can be calculated using the formula:\n\nE = (1/2)mv^2\n\nwhere E is the total energy and v is the final velocity of the comet after impact.\n\nHowever, we need to find the final velocity (v) of the comet. To do this, we can use the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total energy before and after the impact must be equal.\n\nInitially, the comet has gravitational potential energy (PE) given by:\n\nPE = m*GM*R/R = m*GM*R/R\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and M and R are the mass and radius of the earth, respectively.\n\nAfter the impact, the comet transfers all its kinetic energy to the earth. Therefore, the final potential energy of the comet is zero. The total energy after the impact is the sum of the kinetic energy of the comet and the potential energy of the earth:\n\nE_total = KE_comet + PE_earth\n\nSince the comet transfers all its kinetic energy to the earth, KE_comet = 0.5*m*v^2, and PE_earth = m*GM*R/R.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for E_total, we get:\n\nE_total = 0.5*m*v^2 + m*GM*R/R\n\nNow, we know that at the minimum impact speed, the total energy released in the impact is equal to the gravitational potential energy of the comet:\n\n0.5*m*v^2 = m*GM*R/R\n\nSolving for v, we get:\n\nv = sqrt(2*GM/R)\n\nSubstituting this value of v into the equation for E_total, we get:\n\nE_total = 0.5*m*(sqrt(2*GM/R))^2 + m*GM*R/R\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nE_total = 0.5*m*(2*GM/R) + m*GM*R/R\n\nE_total = m*(2*GM/R) + 0.5*m*GM*R/R\n\nE_total = m*GM*R/(R*(1-1/2))\n\nE_total = m*GM*R/2\n\nTherefore, the expression for the total energy released in the impact is:\n\nE_total = 0.5*m*(2GM/R)\n\nAnswer: (C) 0.5*m*(2GM/R)",
