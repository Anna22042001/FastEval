This action goes against the ordinary moral standard of honesty and respect for others' preferences. Therefore, this action can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 2:\nIn this scenario, the main character hands the toilet brush to their brother to clean his teeth. While this action may be seen as unusual or unconventional, it does not intentionally harm or disrespect anyone.
