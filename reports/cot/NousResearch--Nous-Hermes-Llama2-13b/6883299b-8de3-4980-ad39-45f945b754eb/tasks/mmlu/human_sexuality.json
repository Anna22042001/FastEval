            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) the placenta and uterus secretion of prostaglandins.\n\nThe onset of labor is triggered by a complex interplay of hormones and physical factors. Prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances, play a crucial role in initiating labor. The placenta and uterus secrete prostaglandins, which help to soften the cervix and prepare it for dilation. Additionally, prostaglandins stimulate the contraction of the uterine muscles, leading to labor contractions.\n\nWhile hormones secreted by the mother's ovaries, hypothalamus, and fetus' adrenal gland do play a role in regulating the menstrual cycle and preparing the body for pregnancy, they are not the primary trigger for the onset of labor.",

            "model_answer": "The theory that uses terms such as \"modelling\" and \"imitation\" to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on a person's behavior is (D) social learning theory. \n\nSocial learning theory, proposed by Albert Bandura, suggests that people learn by observing others and imitating their behavior. In the context of erotica, this theory suggests that exposure to erotic materials can lead to changes in behavior through the process of modeling and imitation. \n\nSociobiology (A), psychoanalytic theory (B), and script theory (C) do not use these specific terms to explain the effects of exposure to erotica on behavior. Sociobiology focuses on the biological and evolutionary basis of behavior, while psychoanalytic theory emphasizes unconscious processes and early childhood experiences. Script theory is a communication theory that focuses on the shared understanding between senders and receivers of messages.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Menstruation.\n\nMenstruation is the shedding of the inner lining of the uterus, also known as the endometrium. This occurs every month in women of reproductive age, except during pregnancy. The process of menstruation is a part of the menstrual cycle, which is the series of changes that a woman's body goes through in preparation for a potential pregnancy.\n\nThe follicular phase is the first phase of the menstrual cycle, during which the follicles in the ovaries mature and release hormones that stimulate the growth of the endometrium. Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary during the middle of the menstrual cycle. The luteal phase is the second half of the menstrual cycle, during which the egg that was released during ovulation is either fertilized and implants into the uterus, or the endometrium is shed during menstruation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Menstruation.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The environment for sperm passage is most hospitable just at ovulation.\n\nReasoning:\nOvulation is the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary into the fallopian tube. This is the time when the egg is most receptive to fertilization by sperm. The cervical mucus also changes during ovulation, becoming more clear and slippery, which allows sperm to move more easily through the cervix and into the uterus. Therefore, the answer is (C) ovulation.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) urethra. \n\nGonorrhea and chlamydia are both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can affect both men and women. In men, these infections most commonly infect the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The urethra is located at the tip of the penis and is the most common site of infection for both gonorrhea and chlamydia. \n\nWhile the scrotum and bladder can also be affected by these infections, they are less common sites of infection compared to the urethra. The penis is not a correct answer because it is not a specific enough location for the infection to occur. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) urethra.",

For example, a person who is outgoing may be more attracted to someone who is introverted, or someone who is creative may be more attracted to someone who is practical.\nHowever, this is not always the case. In other situations, people may be more attracted to someone who shares similar traits or characteristics with them. For example, two extroverted people may be more likely to be attracted to each other than two introverted people.\nOverall, the saying \"opposites attract\" may hold some truth, but it is not a universal rule. The attractiveness of opposites may depend on various factors such as personality, culture, and individual preferences.",
