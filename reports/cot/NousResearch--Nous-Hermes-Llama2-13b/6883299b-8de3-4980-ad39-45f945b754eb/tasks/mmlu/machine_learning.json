            "model_answer": "The structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network is (B) the learning rate.\n\nThe learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines how quickly the weights of the neural network are updated during training. A high learning rate can cause the model to converge quickly, but it may also lead to overfitting, as the model may not have enough time to adjust the weights to fit the training data accurately. On the other hand, a low learning rate can cause the model to converge slowly, which may lead to underfitting, as the model may not be able to learn the complex patterns in the data.\n\nThe number of hidden nodes (A), the initial choice of weights (C), and the use of a constant-term unit input (D) can also affect the performance of the neural network, but they are not as critical as the learning rate in determining the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) the learning rate.",

L2 regularization, also known as the square loss or the Euclidean distance, is a measure of the goodness of fit of a linear model. It penalizes large errors equally for all observations, whereas L1 regularization, also known as the absolute deviation or the taxicab distance, penalizes large errors more for some observations than for others. As a result, L2 regularization tends to produce smoother and more interpretable models than L1 regularization, which can lead to overfitting.\n\nStatement 2: Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers.\n\nThis statement is also true. Residual connections are a technique used in deep learning to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. They involve adding the original input to the output of each layer before passing it to the next layer. This allows the gradient to flow more easily through the network and helps prevent overfitting. ResNets, which are a type of convolutional neural network, use residual connections in their architecture. Transformers, which are a type of attention-based neural network, also use residual connections in their self-attention mechanism.",
