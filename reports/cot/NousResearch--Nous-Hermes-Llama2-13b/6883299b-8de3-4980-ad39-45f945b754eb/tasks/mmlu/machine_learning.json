Linear regression is a statistical method to model the linear relationship between variables. The estimator of the linear regression is the least squares estimator, which has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\n\nStatement 2:\nThe coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\n\nThis statement is also true. AdaBoost is a machine learning algorithm used for classification. The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers are boosting factors, which are always non-negative. If the coefficient is negative, it would be replaced by 0, which means that the classifier will have no impact on the final prediction.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(A) True, True",

            "model_answer": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\nStatement 1: Support vector machines, like logistic regression models, give a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example.\n\nThis statement is true. Support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression models are both binary classification algorithms that can be used for classification and regression tasks. Both of these algorithms output a probability distribution over the possible labels given an input example. For example, in the case of SVM with a linear kernel and binary classification, the output is the probability of the positive class, which can be interpreted as a probability distribution over the two classes.\n\nStatement 2: We would expect the support vectors to remain the same in general as we move from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nThis statement is false. The support vectors do not remain the same when moving from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels. The support vectors are the points in the training set that are closest to the margin of the hyperplane that separates the positive and negative classes. With a linear kernel, the support vectors lie on the margin of the linear hyperplane. However, when moving to higher order polynomial kernels, the hyperplane becomes a higher dimensional hyper-surface, and the support vectors may not necessarily lie on the margin of the hyper-surface. Therefore, the support vectors will change when moving from a linear kernel to higher order polynomial kernels.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) True, False.",

They are able to preserve the spatial relationship of pixels and can learn features directly from the raw input data without the need for manual feature engineering. This makes them particularly well-suited for high-resolution images, where traditional Fully Connected Networks (C) may struggle with the large number of parameters and the potential for overfitting.

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a statistical method used in machine learning to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters given a set of data. EM algorithm iteratively alternates between computing the expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood and updating the parameters of the model. As the number of iterations increases, the log-likelihood of the data will tend to increase towards its maximum value, which means that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution.\n\nStatement 2: One disadvantage of Q-learning is that it can only be used when the learner has prior knowledge of how its actions affect its environment.\nThis statement is also True. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an action-value function that maps states to the expected cumulative reward of taking each action in that state. However, Q-learning requires prior knowledge of the reward function and the transition probabilities of the environment. Without this prior knowledge, Q-learning may not be effective in learning the optimal policy.",

As we iterate through multiple iterations of the gradient descent algorithm, the overall computational cost increases linearly with the number of iterations (N).

In other words, it measures how well the decision tree is able to separate the examples based on the chosen feature.
