The critical angle is the angle at which the light would undergo total internal reflection at the air-water interface. For water, the critical angle is approximately 48 degrees. Since the angle of incidence (20 degrees) is less than the critical angle, some light will undergo total internal reflection and the remaining light will pass into the air above. So, the correct answer is (A) totally internally reflects.",

This means that the color with the shortest wavelength, which has more energy, will appear more blue, while the color with the longest wavelength, which has less energy, will appear more red.\n\nThe colors in the answer choices are organized in the order of the visible light spectrum, which goes from red to violet. \n\nSo, let's start by looking at the colors at the top of the spectrum, which have more energy per photon. Blue is the first color on this list, which means it has the shortest wavelength among the colors given. After blue, there is violet, which has an even shorter wavelength and thus more energy per photon than blue.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) yellow-green",

            "model_answer": "General relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, is a theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. \n\n(A) Mass distorts spacetime: This is a key concept in general relativity. As an object with mass moves through spacetime, it causes the spacetime to bend around it. This bending of spacetime is what we perceive as gravity.\n\n(B) Gravity affects clocks: According to general relativity, time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields. This means that a clock placed in a stronger gravitational field will run slower than a clock in a weaker gravitational field. This effect is known as gravitational time dilation and has been confirmed through numerous experiments.\n\n(C) Light can\u2019t escape from a black hole: Black holes are regions of spacetime where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This is why black holes are called \"black\": they do not emit any light or radiation that can be detected. This prediction of general relativity has also been confirmed through numerous observations.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) All of these.",

            "model_answer": "Spectral lines of the elements are (B) ordered.\n\nSpectral lines are the separated lines of colors in a spectrum produced by a prism, according to the wavelength of the light. When we observe the emission or absorption spectrum of any element, we can see the spectral lines. These lines are not chaotic, random or disordered. Instead, they are very precise and accurate.\n\nThe reason behind this accuracy is the quantum mechanical phenomenon called the Zeeman effect, which causes spectral lines to split into multiple sub-lines due to the presence of an external magnetic field. This effect demonstrates that the energy levels of electrons in atoms are quantized, meaning that they can only take on specific values. Since the energy levels are quantized, the spectral lines are also quantized, and thus, they are ordered.",
