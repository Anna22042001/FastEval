            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) All of these.\n\nGeneral relativity, which is a theory of gravitation proposed by Albert Einstein, predicts that:\n\n1. Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity: This is known as gravitational redshift. According to general relativity, the gravitational field of the Sun causes the frequency of light to decrease as it moves away from the Sun. This means that the light appears to be redshifted, or shifted towards the red end of the spectrum.\n\n2. Light passing the Sun is deflected: This is known as gravitational lensing. According to general relativity, the gravitational field of the Sun bends the path of light that passes near it. This bending causes the light to follow a curved path, which can result in the light being deflected.\n\n3. A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth: This is known as gravitational time dilation. According to general relativity, the gravitational field of the Sun causes time to pass more slowly on the Sun's surface compared to Earth. This means that a clock on the Sun's surface would run faster than a clock on Earth.\n\nTherefore, all three predictions are correct and the answer is (D) All of these.",

When an element ejects a beta particle, it loses an electron from its nucleus. The atomic number of an element represents the number of protons in its nucleus. Since the element loses an electron, its atomic number decreases by 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) reduces by 1.",

            "model_answer": "To find the complementary color of blue, we need to understand how colors work. Colors are part of the visible light spectrum, and they are organized in a way that when mixed together, they create white light. The color wheel is a tool that helps us understand the relationship between colors.\n\nBlue is a primary color, which means it is one of the three colors (red, blue, and yellow) that cannot be created by mixing other colors. The complementary color of blue is the color that is opposite to it on the color wheel.\n\nWhen blue and its complementary color are mixed together, they create a neutral color, which is white. So, the complementary color of blue is the color that is opposite to it on the color wheel.\n\nLooking at the color wheel, we can see that the color opposite to blue is orange. Therefore, the complementary color of blue is (B) yellow.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) inoperable.\n\nA barometer is a scientific instrument that measures atmospheric pressure. It works by measuring the height of a column of liquid (usually mercury or water) in a sealed tube. The height of the liquid column is directly proportional to the pressure of the atmosphere.\n\nIf a barometer uses water instead of mercury, it will still measure the height of the water column in response to changes in atmospheric pressure. However, water is less dense than mercury, so a column of water will be taller than a column of mercury of the same height. This means that the barometer will respond to changes in atmospheric pressure differently than a barometer that uses mercury.\n\nIn particular, a barometer that uses water will overestimate the pressure of the atmosphere, because the water column will be taller than it would be if mercury were used. This means that the barometer will give incorrect readings, and it will not be able to accurately measure atmospheric pressure. Therefore, a barometer that uses water instead of mercury will be inoperable.",

The energy released in this reaction is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the alpha particle and the neutron.\n\nThe alpha particle carries most of the energy released in the reaction because it has a larger mass and is moving at a higher velocity than the neutron. The neutron also carries some energy, but less than the alpha particle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) kinetic energy of the alpha particle.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\nIn a circular orbit around the Earth, the gravitational force on a satellite is always directed towards the Earth's center. Since the satellite is moving in a circular path, the gravitational force is always perpendicular to the satellite's velocity. Therefore, the gravitational force does not change the satellite's speed.\n\nHowever, the gravitational force on the satellite is weaker than at the Earth's surface because the satellite is farther away from the Earth's center. The gravitational force decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the Earth. So, as the satellite moves along its circular path, the gravitational force on it decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) appreciably weaker than at Earth\u2019s surface.",
