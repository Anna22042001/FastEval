Since the charge distribution is not uniform, we can use Gauss's law to find the electric field outside the object.\n\nGauss's law states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the total charge enclosed by the surface divided by the permittivity of free space. Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\n\u03a6 = q_enclosed / \u03b5\u2080\n\nHere, \u03a6 is the total electric flux through the surface, q_enclosed is the total charge enclosed by the surface, and \u03b5\u2080 is the permittivity of free space.\n\nFor a uniformly charged object, the electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object.

This means that if one capacitor has a capacitance of C1 and the other has a capacitance of C2, the total capacitance in the circuit will be C1+C2.\n\nSince both capacitors have the same capacitance, they will store the same amount of charge when connected to the same voltage. This is because the charge stored on a capacitor is proportional to its voltage according to the formula Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage.\n\nTherefore, the charge stored on the capacitor will be the same for both capacitors, which corresponds to option (A). \n\nAdditionally, since the capacitors have the same capacitance, their voltage across them will be the same as well. This is because the voltage across a capacitor is proportional to its capacitance according to the formula V = 1/C, where V is the voltage, and C is the capacitance.\n\nThus, the voltage across the capacitor will be the same for both capacitors, which corresponds to option (B).\n\nSo, the final answer is: (B) the voltage across the capacitor.",

The object slides without rotating to the bottom of the incline.\n3. The object\u2019s kinetic energy at the bottom must be determined.\n\nNow let's consider the total mechanical energy of the object. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its gravitational potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE). So, \n\nTotal Mechanical Energy = PE + KE\n\nAt the top of the incline, the object is at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. Its gravitational potential energy is given by the formula:\n\nPE = m * g * h\n\nwhere m is the mass of the object (1 kg), g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s^2), and h is the height of the incline.\n\nAt the bottom of the incline, the object has a non-zero kinetic energy. Let's denote this kinetic energy as KE_bottom. Then, the total mechanical energy of the object at the bottom is:\n\nPE_bottom + KE_bottom\n\nSince the object slides without rotating, the potential energy at the bottom of the incline is the same as the potential energy at the top of the incline (the object did not lose any height). Therefore:\n\nPE_bottom = PE_top\n\nSo, we have:\n\nPE_top + KE_bottom = PE_top + 0\n\nSolving for KE_bottom:\n\nKE_bottom = 0\n\nTherefore, the object's kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline is 0. Since the object's kinetic energy at the bottom is less than or equal to the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released, option (D) is the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: (D) Less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the work done by the friction force must be greater than the block\u2019s gain in kinetic energy.",

The forces acting on the box are gravity and the frictional force due to the kinetic friction.\n\nThe gravitational force acting on the box is given by Fg = mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nThe kinetic frictional force acting on the box is given by Ff = \u03bcFgn, where Fgn is the normal force acting on the box. Since the box is sliding on a horizontal surface, the normal force is equal to the weight of the box, which is mg. Therefore, Ff = \u03bcmg.\n\nThe net force acting on the box is the difference between the gravitational force and the frictional force: Fnet = Fg - Ff = mg - \u03bcmg.\n\nSince the box is initially at rest, the net force acting on it is zero.
