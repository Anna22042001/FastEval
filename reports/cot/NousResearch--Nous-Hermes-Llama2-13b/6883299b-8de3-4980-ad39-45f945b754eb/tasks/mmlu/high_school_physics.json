            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The ball's speed is zero at the highest point.\nThis is true because the ball's velocity is changing direction from up to down, so its speed (magnitude of velocity) must be zero at the highest point.\n\nThe ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point.\nThis is false because air resistance is not negligible, which means the ball's acceleration is not just due to gravity. The net acceleration of the ball at the highest point will be less than the acceleration due to gravity alone, but it will still be non-zero.\n\nThe ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down.\nThis is true because the ball's velocity is changing direction from up to down, which means its displacement (the distance it travels) will be less than the displacement it gains when falling back down. Therefore, the time it takes to travel up to the highest point will be longer than the time it takes to fall back down.\n\nAnswer: (D) I & III only",

            "model_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use Coulomb's Law, which states that the electric force between two charged particles is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nF_AB = k * (q_A * q_B) / r^2\n\nwhere F_AB is the electric force between particles A and B, q_A and q_B are the charges of particles A and B, r is the distance between them, and k is the electrostatic constant.\n\nSince particle A has a net charge of 2Q and particle B has a net charge of Q, we can write:\n\nq_A = 2Q\nq_B = Q\n\nThe distance between the two particles is given as 4 m. Plugging these values into Coulomb's Law, we get:\n\nF_AB = k * (2Q * Q) / (4 m)^2\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the equation for F_AB:\n\n(F_AB / F_AB) = (k * (2Q * Q) / (4 m)^2) / (k * (Q * Q) / (4 m)^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(F_AB / F_AB) = (2Q * Q) / (Q * Q)\n\nSince Q is a constant, we can cancel it out:\n\n(F_AB / F_AB) = 2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is 2:1.
