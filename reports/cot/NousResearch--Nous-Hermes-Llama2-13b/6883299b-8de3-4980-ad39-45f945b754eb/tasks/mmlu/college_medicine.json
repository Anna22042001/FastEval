            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing water lost through skin. \n\nExplanation: When the body is exposed to higher temperatures, it needs to cool down to maintain a stable internal temperature. One way it does this is by increasing the amount of water lost through the skin, which is known as sweating. As sweat evaporates from the skin's surface, it cools the body down. The other options listed are not relevant to this particular situation.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is option (D) uptake and oxidation by other tissues.\n\nLactate is produced in muscle cells during anaerobic metabolism and is released into the bloodstream. It is then taken up by other tissues, such as the liver, heart, and brain, where it is oxidized to produce energy through aerobic metabolism. This process is known as the lactate shuttle.\n\nThe liver and heart can also convert lactate back into pyruvate, which can then be used for gluconeogenesis or enter the citric acid cycle to produce energy. However, the primary fate of lactate in the circulation is uptake and oxidation by other tissues.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs in the nucleus. \n\nReasoning: \nTranscription is the process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is copied into a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). This process occurs in the nucleus of the cell, as the nucleus contains the cell's DNA. The mRNA then carries the genetic information out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it is used to synthesize proteins by ribosomes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) in the nucleus.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) genetically determined.\n\nIn a double stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines (adenine and guanine) to pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil) is always 1:1. This is because each strand of DNA is composed of a sequence of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine.\n\nThe sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule is determined by the genetic code, which is the set of rules that governs the translation of the nucleotide sequence into the amino acid sequence of proteins. The genetic code is universal, meaning that it is the same for all living organisms, and it ensures that the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) genetically determined.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The first molecule that will stop being produced when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is pyruvate. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. In the presence of oxygen, cells produce energy through cellular respiration, which involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n2. Glycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration, where glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate.\n\n3. Pyruvate then enters the mitochondria and undergoes the citric acid cycle, where it is further broken down to produce ATP, NADH, and FADH2.\n\n4. NADH and FADH2 then donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.\n\n5. This proton gradient drives the production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n6. If oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the electron transport chain will stop functioning, and the citric acid cycle will also stop producing ATP.\n\n7. Without ATP, glycolysis will also stop, as ATP is required to transport pyruvate into the mitochondria.\n\n8. Therefore, the first molecule that will stop being produced when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is pyruvate.\n\nAnswer: B) Pyruvate.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Glutamine.\n\nGlutamine is an amino acid that can act as an intracellular buffer to limit pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. It does this by binding to hydrogen ions (H+) and reducing the concentration of free H+ ions in the cell. This helps to maintain the cell's pH within a stable range.\n\nGlucose (B) is a simple sugar that can be used as an energy source in glycolysis, but it does not directly act as an intracellular buffer.\n\nCarnosine (C) is a dipeptide that can act as a buffer, but it is primarily found in muscle tissue and does not have a significant role in glycolysis.\n\nAmylase (D) is an enzyme that breaks down starch into glucose, but it does not have any direct role in buffering intracellular pH changes during glycolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Glutamine.",

This results in an increase in blood lactate concentration, which is a marker of muscle fatigue. Therefore, the blood lactate concentration will generally increase throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.",

The breakdown of these molecules releases energy that can be used to power muscle contractions. However, the energy stored in ATP and phosphocreatine is limited, and it can only sustain maximal exertion exercise for a short period of time. \n\nThe duration of maximal exertion exercise is typically measured in seconds, and it is generally accepted that the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain exercise for about 5-10 seconds. This is known as the phosphocreatine system, and it is the primary energy system used during short bursts of high-intensity exercise. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 5-10 seconds.",
