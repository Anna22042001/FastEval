            "model_answer": "The most appropriate next step in treatment for a 46-year-old woman with active ankylosing spondylitis who has not responded to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sulfasalazine is to administer a drug that inhibits tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). This is because TNF-\u03b1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the inflammatory process of ankylosing spondylitis. Inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 can help reduce inflammation and improve the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, the answer is (D) Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1.",

Following a physical examination, a CT\u00a0scan of the pelvis is ordered. After the scan is complete, the radiologist calls to report that the patient has a surgical sponge in her pelvis. In a subsequent malpractice suit, the plaintiff establishes that the sponge could not have been left unless there was negligence. The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is\n\n(A) collateral estoppel\n(B) proximate cause\n(C) res ipsa loquitur\n(D) respondeat superior",

            "model_answer": "The most appropriate term to represent the legal concept invoked by the patient is (C) res ipsa loquitur.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to establish negligence without direct evidence of fault, based on the fact that the accident or injury would not have occurred in the absence of negligence. In this case, the patient's pelvic pain began after a hysterectomy, and the discovery of a surgical sponge in her pelvis suggests that there was negligence during the surgery. The fact that the sponge was left behind is evidence of negligence, and the patient can use the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to establish that the defendant was negligent.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements. \n\nThis is the most relevant additional history to obtain in this situation, as the patient is presenting with abdominal pain and constipation. Obtaining information about the color, caliber, and frequency of bowel movements can help determine if the patient has a more serious underlying condition such as constipation, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal issues. This information can also help guide treatment options for the patient's constipation. \n\nWhile the other options may be relevant in different situations, they are not as pertinent in this case. (B) Exposure to sexually transmitted diseases may be relevant if the patient is experiencing symptoms related to an STD, but it is not directly related to the presenting complaint of abdominal pain and constipation. (C) Family history of irritable bowel syndrome may be relevant if the patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with IBS, but again, it is not directly related to the presenting complaint. (D) Menstrual history may be relevant if the patient is experiencing menstrual-related symptoms, but it is not directly related to the presenting complaint of abdominal pain and constipation.",

When she stands up suddenly, she becomes light-headed and has to steady herself for approximately 1 to 2 minutes before she is able to walk. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, a diuretic, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent, and an angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Her pulse is 55/min. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg in the right arm and 70/50 mm Hg in the left arm while supine; her blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg in the right arm and 50/30 mm Hg in the left arm immediately after standing.

Carotid duplex ultrasonography shows reverse flow in the left vertebral artery with no evidence of occlusion.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The most appropriate next step in management is (B) adjusting her medication regimen. \n\nThe patient's symptoms of dizziness and light-headedness when standing suddenly suggest that she may have orthostatic hypotension, which is a common side effect of antihypertensive medications, particularly diuretics and ACE inhibitors. The patient's blood pressure measurements while supine and immediately after standing also support this diagnosis. \n\nSince the ECG shows sinus bradycardia with no evidence of ischemia, cardiac stress scintigraphy (A) is not necessary at this time. Transesophageal echocardiography (D) is also not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of structural heart disease. Warfarin therapy (C) is not appropriate for orthostatic hypotension, as it is used to prevent blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions that increase the risk of stroke.\n\nAdjusting the patient's medication regimen, particularly reducing the dose of diuretic and ACE inhibitor, may help alleviate her symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. The physician should also consider educating the patient about the potential side effects of her medications and how to manage them, such as increasing fluid intake and slowly rising from a seated position.",

The history of excessive drinking and possible drug use also raises concerns for withdrawal or overdose. However, the presence of leukocytosis and elevated serum creatine kinase activity are more consistent with a neurological etiology.\n\nThe patient's recent psychiatric history and the fact that he was prescribed a medication but the sister is not sure what it is, suggests that he may be taking an antipsychotic medication. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of antipsychotic medication use, characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status.\n\nWhile bacterial meningitis can present with similar symptoms, the absence of meningeal signs (such as neck stiffness) and the presence of fever and leukocytosis are more consistent with a systemic infection. Amphetamine intoxication typically presents with hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, but the patient's history of excessive drinking and possible drug use suggests a more complex etiology.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (D).",
