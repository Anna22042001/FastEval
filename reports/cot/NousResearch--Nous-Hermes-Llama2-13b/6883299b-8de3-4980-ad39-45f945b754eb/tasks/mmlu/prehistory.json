            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "(B) warfare.\n\nThe Minoan civilization was centered on the island of Crete and flourished from approximately 2600 to 1400 BCE. It was known for its advanced cultural and artistic achievements, including architecture, painting, and pottery. Unlike many other early civilizations, Minoan culture does not show much evidence of warfare or organized military conflict. This is evident in the lack of fortifications, weapons, or battle scenes in Minoan art and architecture. Instead, Minoan culture seems to have been characterized by a peaceful and prosperous society, focused on trade, agriculture, and marine exploitation. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) warfare.",

            "model_answer": "The greatest Egyptian pyramids at Giza were built as burial monuments for the pharaoh Khufu, Khufu's son Khafre, and Khufu's grandson Menkaure. This is the correct answer. These pyramids were built during the Old Kingdom period of ancient Egypt, around 2580 BCE for Khufu, 2560 BCE for Khafre, and 2532 BCE for Menkaure. It is known that the pyramids were built as tombs for the pharaohs, and there is no evidence to suggest that slaves were used in their construction. The construction of these pyramids was a massive undertaking that involved thousands of skilled workers, but there is no evidence to suggest that they were coerced or worked under the threat of death, as described in the book of Exodus. While there was a construction frenzy during the 6th dynasty, this was centered around the construction of smaller pyramids and tombs for nobles and officials, not the great pyramids at Giza. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",

The \"Lion Man\" is a lion-human figure that was discovered in the Hohlenstein-Stadel cave in Germany and is approximately 32,000 years old. It is one of the oldest known examples of parietal art. \n\nSince it is a figurative painting, it does not fall under (A) mobiliary art, which refers to portable, moveable objects like ivory carvings or tools. Similarly, it does not represent long-distance trade of exotic raw materials as evidenced by the discovery site, and it is not a Venus figurine which is a type of small, portable figurine typically depicting a female form.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the context provided, the markings found on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol are most likely (A) instructions for the builders written there by the engineers. This is because the Huaca del Sol is an archaeological site in Peru, and the mud-bricks found there are likely to have been used in the construction of the site. It is reasonable to assume that the builders would have needed instructions on how to lay the bricks, and it is also plausible that the engineers responsible for the construction would have provided those instructions.\n\nOption (B) random scratches and not a meaningful script or written language is possible but less likely, as it would suggest that the markings have no purpose or meaning, which is not consistent with the idea that they were used in the construction of the site.\n\nOption (C) intended to identify the local group that had produced them is also possible but less likely, as it assumes that the markings were primarily a means of identification rather than a tool for construction.\n\nOption (D) simple arithmetic performed by carpenters on the building site is the least likely option, as it suggests that the markings were used for mathematical calculations rather than construction instructions. While it is possible that carpenters might have used math to build the site, it is less likely that they would have recorded their calculations on the mud-bricks themselves.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is (A) instructions for the builders written there by the engineers.",

            "model_answer": "The answer to the question is: (B) it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age.\n\nHere's the reasoning for the steps:\n\n1. The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies refers to the fact that human infants are born relatively undeveloped and helpless compared to other mammals, and this has been an evolutionary adaptation.\n\n2. The question states that the brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years. However, this fact is not relevant to the question and does not help in determining the answer. So, we can eliminate (A).\n\n3. The question also states that it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age. This is a crucial piece of information that points us towards the correct answer. It means that the secondarily altricial condition of human babies allowed them to walk and be independent from their mothers at an earlier age than other mammals, which is a significant advantage in terms of survival and evolution.\n\n4. The other options, (C) and (D), do not directly address the question of bipedalism and independence from the mother. Therefore, we can eliminate them as well.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) species focused on grasses to nuts and fruits.\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe C3 and C4 pathways are photosynthetic pathways used by plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic compounds. The C3 pathway is used by plants such as grasses, while the C4 pathway is used by plants such as corn and sugarcane.\n\nThe research indicates that changes in plant communities were associated with a transition in the diets of ancient hominids from grasses to nuts and fruits. This suggests that the ancient hominids were consuming more C3 plants, which include grasses. The C4 pathway is not mentioned in the question, so option (B) meat to fruits and vegetables, option (C) fruits and vegetables to fish, and option (D) nuts and fruits to species more focused on grasses can be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) species focused on grasses to nuts and fruits.",
