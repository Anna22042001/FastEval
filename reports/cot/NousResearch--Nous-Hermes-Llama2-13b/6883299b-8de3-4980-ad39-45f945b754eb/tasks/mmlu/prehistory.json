            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) prognathous. \n\nA forward-thrusting lower face is called prognathous, which means \"forward-jawed.\" This term is used to describe animals with a lower jaw that extends further forward than the upper jaw. This type of jaw structure is common in carnivorous animals, such as dogs and cats, and helps them to better capture and tear apart their prey. \n\nThe other options are:\n(A) arboreal - refers to animals that live or move about in trees\n(C) diastema - a gap between two teeth, usually the incisors and the molars\n(D) mandible - the lower jawbone of a vertebrate animal.",

            "model_answer": "The Levallois technology was a major innovation in the Paleolithic period, which involved the production of stone tools using a specific method. The question asks about the shift in emphasis from producing certain types of tools to producing others. Let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) producing core tools to producing flakes: The Levallois method involves the production of flakes, not core tools. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n(B) producing pottery to producing clothing: The Levallois technology is related to the production of stone tools, not pottery or clothing. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n(C) producing arrows to producing spear points: The Levallois technology is not related to the production of arrow or spear points. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n(D) larger, duller axes to smaller, sharper ones: The Levallois method involves the production of flakes, which are usually smaller and sharper than the cores from which they are removed. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n(E) None of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) a hieroglyphic written language and calendar. \n\nBy 1900 B.P., the Mayan civilization had already developed a hieroglyphic written language and a complex calendar system. The Mayan script was one of the few fully developed writing systems of the ancient world, and it was used to record a wide variety of information, including historical events, religious texts, and astronomical observations. The Mayan calendar was also highly sophisticated, incorporating multiple cycles and alignments to track the movements of celestial bodies and mark important dates.\n\nOptions (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect because they were all elements of Mayan culture that were in place by 1900 B.P. Stratified societies ruled by kings, ritual ball games, and a reverence for precious jade were all aspects of Mayan culture that emerged during the Preclassic period (2000 B.C. - 250 A.D.) and continued to be important throughout the Classic period (250 A.D. - 900 A.D.).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) a hieroglyphic written language and calendar.",

            "model_answer": "The wild progenitor of maize is teosinte. \n\nExplanation:\nMaize, also known as corn, is a domesticated plant that belongs to the grass family. It is believed to have originated from a wild grass called teosinte, which is native to Mexico. Over thousands of years, humans selectively bred teosinte to develop the maize we know today. The process involved crossing different teosinte varieties to create a plant with larger seeds, a more upright growth habit, and a more efficient photosynthesis process. Therefore, the wild progenitor of maize is teosinte.",

            "model_answer": "The Younger Dryas was a period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago. \n\nReasoning: \nThe Younger Dryas was a geologically short period of time, lasting from approximately 12,900 to 11,600 years ago. During this time, there was a sudden return to glacial conditions, with a significant cooling of the climate and an expansion of glaciers in many parts of the world. This period is named after the plant species Dryas octopetala, which was common during this time and has been found in glacial deposits from this period. The Younger Dryas is significant because it was a major factor in the extinction of many large mammals, including the woolly mammoth and the saber-toothed cat, as well as in the migration and adaptation of early human populations. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) a period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago.",

It was responsible for performing religious rituals, maintaining the gods' favor, and providing social services such as education, healthcare, and food distribution. The temple was considered a powerful entity, and its priests held considerable influence over the people. The temple's power predated the advent of social complexity, as it was already an important institution in the early stages of Mesopotamian civilization.

The hypothesis is based on recent research that has looked at the relationship between tool making and brain function. \n\n(B) tool making requires cooperation that can only exist with language. \n\nThis option suggests that tool making relies on cooperation, which can only be achieved through the use of language. However, this statement does not explain how tool making itself might have contributed to the development of language. \n\n(C) tool making originated millions of years after language evolved. \n\nThis option suggests that tool making is a relatively recent development in human history, and that language evolved long before it. While this may be true, it does not address the question of how tool making might have contributed to the development of language. \n\n(D) connections made between the brain and bipedal locomotion prepared the hands for tool making. \n\nThis option suggests that the development of bipedal locomotion may have prepared the hands for tool making, but it does not address the question of how tool making might have contributed to the development of language. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).",
