Which proposition below is most inconsistent with this claim?\n\n(A) In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\n(B) The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\n(C) Judges exercise strong discretion.\n(D) Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.",

            "model_answer": "The proposition that is most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer to every legal question is option (C) - Judges exercise strong discretion. This is because if judges have strong discretion, it implies that there may not always be a clear and definitive right answer to a legal question, and that the outcome of a case may depend on the individual judge's interpretation and decision-making process. This goes against Dworkin's belief that there is a single correct answer to every legal question.",

The Romans were the first to develop a systematic theory of natural law, which they believed was derived from the principles of reason and nature. The Roman jurist Ulpian, for example, argued that the law of nature was the basis of all law, and that justice was the ultimate goal of all legal systems. This idea was later developed by medieval scholars, such as St. Thomas Aquinas, and played a significant role in the development of modern legal systems.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct statement concerning the \"reasonable person\" standard in tort law is (C) A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.\n\nThe reasonable person standard is an objective standard that measures a person's conduct against the conduct of a hypothetical reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances. It does not vary from person to person, and it does not focus on the defendant's subjective mental state. Instead, it focuses on the defendant's behavior and what a reasonable person would have done in the same situation.\n\nRegarding the physical and mental disabilities, the standard does not require a person with a physical disability to act as would a reasonable person without a disability. However, a person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability. Similarly, a person with a mental disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same mental disability. This is because the reasonable person standard takes into account the limitations and impairments caused by the disability.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) Effectiveness of rehabilitation of multiplied by hazard to the community.\n\nRobert Nozick's formula r x H means that the appropriate punishment should be determined by multiplying the effectiveness of rehabilitation (r) by the hazard to the community (H). In other words, the severity of the punishment should be based on how much the offender can be rehabilitated and how much harm they could potentially cause to the community if they were to reoffend. This formula suggests that the goal of punishment should be to prevent future harm while also trying to rehabilitate the offender.",

In this statement, reason is a key element because it is the means by which humans can discover the principles of natural law.
