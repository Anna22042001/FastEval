            "model_answer": "To find the empirical formula of the compound, we need to determine the mass of the oxygen in the sample. \n\nFirst, we need to find the total mass of the compound:\nTotal mass = mass of carbon + mass of hydrogen + mass of oxygen\n\nWe know the mass of carbon (18.02 g) and the mass of hydrogen (3.03 g). We can assume that the mass of oxygen is the difference between the total mass and the sum of the masses of carbon and hydrogen:\n\nMass of oxygen = Total mass - (mass of carbon + mass of hydrogen)\nMass of oxygen = 29.05 g - (18.02 g + 3.03 g)\nMass of oxygen = 29.05 g - 21.05 g\nMass of oxygen = 8.00 g\n\nNow that we know the mass of oxygen, we can find the moles of each element in the compound:\n\nMoles of carbon = mass of carbon / molar mass of carbon\nMoles of carbon = 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol\nMoles of carbon = 1.50 mol\n\nMoles of hydrogen = mass of hydrogen / molar mass of hydrogen\nMoles of hydrogen = 3.03 g / 1.01 g/mol\nMoles of hydrogen = 2.99 mol\n\nMoles of oxygen = mass of oxygen / molar mass of oxygen\nMoles of oxygen = 8.00 g / 16.00 g/mol\nMoles of oxygen = 0.50 mol\n\nNow we can find the mole ratio of each element in the compound:\n\nMole ratio of carbon = moles of carbon / total moles\nMole ratio of carbon = 1.50 mol / (1.50 mol + 2.99 mol + 0.50 mol)\nMole ratio of carbon = 1.50 / 5.00\nMole ratio of carbon = 0.30\n\nMole ratio of hydrogen = moles of hydrogen / total moles\nMole ratio of hydrogen = 2.99 mol / (1.50 mol + 2.99 mol + 0.50 mol)\nMole ratio of hydrogen = 2.99 / 5.00\nMole ratio of hydrogen = 0.598\n\nMole ratio of oxygen = moles of oxygen / total moles\nMole ratio of oxygen = 0.50 mol / (1.50 mol + 2.99 mol + 0.50 mol)\nMole ratio of oxygen = 0.50 / 5.00\nMole ratio of oxygen = 0.10\n\nNow we can write the empirical formula based on the mole ratios:\n\nC_0.30H_0.598O_0.10\n\nSimplifying the mole ratios:\n\nC_0.30H_0.598O_0.10 -> C2H4O\n\nSo, the empirical formula of the compound is C2H4O.",

The Gibbs free energy is a measure of the energy available to do work in a system. A negative \u0394G\u00b0 indicates that the reaction is exergonic, meaning it releases energy, and is therefore spontaneous.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because at equilibrium, the number of products and reactants is equal.\n\nOption (C) is incorrect because the change in entropy (\u0394S\u00b0) is related to the change in disorder in a system. A positive \u0394S\u00b0 indicates an increase in disorder, which can be associated with an exergonic reaction, but it is not a definitive indicator of spontaneity.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the value of Keq is related to the equilibrium constant of a reaction.

However, since the reaction is first-order overall, the rate constant k will remain the same. Therefore, the half-life will decrease.\n\n(B) Increasing the temperature at which the reaction occurs:\n\nAccording to the Arrhenius equation, the rate constant k increases with temperature. Therefore, if the temperature increases, the rate constant k will also increase, leading to a decrease in the half-life.\n\n(C) Decreasing the overall pressure in the container:\n\nThe pressure does not affect the rate of a first-order reaction, as it is a homogeneous reaction.
