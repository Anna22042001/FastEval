Studies have shown that African Americans have a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease compared to other racial groups, and Hispanic Americans may also have a lower risk due to their higher frequency of the APOE e2 allele, which is associated with lower risk for Alzheimer's.

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided in the hypothesis, the correct answer is (A) Those with low capabilities are more vulnerable to environmental demands. \n\nThis is because the docility hypothesis suggests that individuals with low capabilities are more susceptible to the demands of their environment. This means that they may be more likely to follow the rules and conform to social norms in order to survive or adapt to their surroundings. Choice (B) is incorrect because it suggests that those with high environmental demands become more docile, which is not consistent with the hypothesis. Choice (C) is also incorrect because it suggests the opposite of what the hypothesis states, that those with high environmental demands become less docile. Lastly, choice (D) is incorrect because it suggests that those with less capability are less vulnerable to environmental demands, which again contradicts the hypothesis.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "A) Aerobic exercise: Research has shown that regular aerobic exercise can improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of cognitive decline. Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which can improve memory and overall brain health. So, the first step towards remembering the above statement is: \"A) Remember that aerobic exercise improves normal memory.\"\n\nB) Taking acetylcholine: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in many cognitive functions, including memory. However, taking acetylcholine supplements orally has not been shown to have a significant impact on improving memory in healthy individuals. So, the second step is: \"B) Forget about taking acetylcholine supplements to improve normal memory.\"\n\nC) Taking gingko: Ginkgo biloba is an herb that has been used for centuries to treat various ailments, including memory problems. Some studies have shown that taking ginkgo extract can improve cognitive function and memory in older adults with dementia. However, its effectiveness in healthy individuals is still debated. So, the third step is: \"C) Be aware that taking gingko might or might not improve normal memory, depending on the individual.\"\n\nD) Increasing social contacts: Social interaction and engagement have been linked to improved cognitive function and memory. Being socially active stimulates the brain and provides mental exercise, which can improve memory retention and cognitive abilities. So, the final step is: \"D) Remember that increasing social contacts can improve normal memory.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (A) Aerobic exercise.",

Both sides recognize the importance of the other, so the answer \"both play an important role\" applies here.\n\n(B) Mechanistic vs organismic: This dichotomy is about different perspectives on how to understand the functioning of living organisms. Mechanistic views see organisms as machines, with their parts working together according to physical laws, while organismic views see organisms as having their own internal purposes and processes. Both perspectives have their uses and limitations, so the answer \"both play an important role\" applies here as well.\n\n(C) Continuity vs. discontinuity: This question is about whether evolution occurs through a series of small changes or through sudden, major jumps. Both processes occur in nature, so the answer \"both play an important role\" applies.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is (D) All of these questions.",

This is in contrast to unprogrammed theories, which attribute aging only to environmental factors. \n\nThe other options are not relevant to the difference between programmed and unprogrammed theories of senescence. Answer (B) implies that the theories are difficult to test, but this is not a defining characteristic of programmed theories.
