This is a description of hospice care, which is a type of end-of-life care that focuses on comfort and quality of life rather than life-prolonging treatments. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Hospice.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Be absent from work.\n\nReasoning:\nOlder workers may have more health issues or mobility problems, which can lead to absenteeism. They may also have more responsibilities at home, such as caring for grandchildren or elderly parents, which can cause them to miss work. Additionally, older workers may be more likely to retire, and if they are not satisfied with their jobs, they may choose to take time off before retiring. While all of these factors can contribute to lower productivity, the question specifically asks which factor is more likely, and absenteeism is the most direct result of being an older worker.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Interpret the answers you get from people. \n\nThe reasoning behind this is that open-ended questions on a survey often make it difficult to interpret the answers you get from people. While it may be true that open-ended questions can make it difficult to get people to fill out the survey and collect data in a timely manner, the main challenge is usually understanding what the respondents are trying to communicate. Open-ended questions require more analysis and interpretation than closed-ended questions, which have a limited set of responses. This can make it harder to draw conclusions from the data collected.",

While all of these factors are important, social support is the missing factor in the list. \n\nMental stimulation and exercise are important for keeping the mind and body active, while diet is important for providing the body with the necessary nutrients. Social support, on the other hand, is important for emotional well-being and can have a positive impact on physical health. Studies have shown that having strong social connections can reduce stress, improve mood, and even lower the risk of developing certain health conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Social support.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) Talk about your loss.\n\nAccording to Tat Kleckley, the most important part of the healing process for those who are bereaved is to talk about their loss. This is because talking about the loss helps the person to process their emotions and come to terms with their grief. It also allows them to share their experiences and feelings with others, which can provide support and comfort.\n\nA) Staying away from other people for a while might provide some temporary relief, but it can also lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.\nB) Getting out and being active can be helpful in the healing process, but it is not the most important part. It can provide a distraction and help to reduce stress and anxiety, but it does not address the emotional aspect of the grieving process.\nD) Making new friends who don't know about the loss can be a way to start a new chapter in life, but it is not the most important part of the healing process. It can provide a sense of connection and belonging, but it does not address the emotional wounds caused by the loss.\n\nTherefore, the most important part of the healing process for those who are bereaved is to talk about their loss, which is option (C).",
