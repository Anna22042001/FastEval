            "model_answer": "When making a decision on the best approach for newborn infants in countries with limited access to safe water and low levels of education, there are a few factors that need to be considered. \n\nFirst and foremost, it is essential to ensure that the infant is receiving adequate nutrition. Breast milk is the ideal food for infants as it provides all the necessary nutrients for growth and development. However, access to safe water and low levels of education can pose challenges to exclusive breastfeeding. \n\nIn countries with limited access to safe water, there is a risk of contamination of breast milk, which can lead to infections and illnesses. Additionally, mothers with low levels of education may not be aware of the importance of exclusive breastfeeding or may not have the necessary knowledge to ensure their infant's nutritional needs are being met. \n\nTherefore, the best approach would be to promote mixed feeding, which means the infant receives both breast milk and other foods as tolerated. This approach can help ensure that the infant is receiving adequate nutrition while also addressing the concerns related to access to safe water and low levels of education. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) Should receive both breast milk and other foods as tolerated in the first 6 months.",

Innovators are individuals who are willing to try out new products, services or ideas. They are often trendsetters and can help introduce new changes to a community.\n2. Early adapters are also known as opinion leaders or influentials. They have a larger social network and can help spread the word about new changes to a community. They are usually open to trying out new things and are often seen as trustworthy by their peers.\n3. Middle adapters are individuals who are willing to try out new things but are more cautious than early adapters. They may take longer to decide whether or not to try out a new product, service or idea.\n4. Late adapters are often skeptical of change and may be resistant to trying out new things. They may only adopt new changes once they have seen others successfully use them.\nTherefore, to achieve effective change in a community, it is necessary to target a mix of innovators, early adapters, middle adapters, and late adapters. The exact mix will depend on the community being targeted and the specific changes being introduced.\nAnswer: (D) Late adapters.",

In the context of drug use, contingency management specifically involves providing incentives or rewards for drug-free urine samples. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing drug use and promoting healthier behaviors among drug users. Therefore, paying drug users to use condoms falls under the umbrella of contingency management, as it incentivizes a healthy behavior that can reduce the risk of transmitting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. \n\nAnswer: D.",

            "model_answer": "The most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is (D) Clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells. This is because the adaptive immune system allows for a rapid and specific response to a particular pathogen. When a pathogen enters the body, the adaptive immune system can quickly recognize it and activate pre-existing antibodies and T cells that have already encountered and recognized the pathogen during a previous infection or vaccination. This process, known as clonal expansion, involves the rapid replication of these pre-existing B and T cells to produce a large number of effector cells that can target and eliminate the pathogen. This specific and rapid response is unique to the adaptive immune system and is crucial for long-term protection against infections.",
