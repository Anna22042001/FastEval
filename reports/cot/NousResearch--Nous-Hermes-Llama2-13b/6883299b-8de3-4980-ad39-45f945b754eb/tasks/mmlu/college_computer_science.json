In this case, all 10 nodes would form a single connected component. This would result in M = 10.\n\nNow, let's consider the minimum number of connected components. If a graph has just one connected component, it means that all 10 nodes are connected to each other, forming a single, large connected component. In this case, m = 10.\n\nHowever, if we remove one edge from this connected graph, it will split into two smaller connected components. For example, consider a graph with two connected components, each containing 5 nodes. Removing an edge between these two components will not create any new connected components. Therefore, removing an edge will not increase the number of connected components. Similarly, adding any number of edges to a single connected component will also not decrease the number of connected components.\n\nThus, the minimum number of connected components is achieved when there are as few edges as possible without disconnecting the graph.
