            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The most effective form of communication for forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is interpersonal communication. \n\nInterpersonal communication involves one-on-one or small group interactions, where individuals can engage in active listening and provide feedback. This type of communication allows for a more personalized and tailored approach to addressing the issue, and can help build trust and rapport between the communicator and the audience. \n\nMedia communication, such as television, radio, and print, can also be effective in shaping predispositions, but it is often more one-way and less interactive than interpersonal communication. Group communication can be effective in reinforcing predispositions among like-minded individuals, but may not be as effective in changing predispositions among those who hold opposing views. Public communication, such as public speeches or town hall meetings, can be effective in reaching a large audience, but may not be as effective in forming or changing predispositions as interpersonal communication.\n\nTherefore, the most effective form of communication for forming or changing predispositions toward an issue is interpersonal communication. The answer is (A).",
