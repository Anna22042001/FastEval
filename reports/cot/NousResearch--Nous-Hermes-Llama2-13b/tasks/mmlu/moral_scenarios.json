While this action may not be morally wrong in itself, it can be seen as reckless driving, which can be considered a morally questionable act. Therefore, this scenario can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is teaching their children to play the xylophone. This action is not morally wrong and is, in fact, a positive action that can be considered morally good.
