            "model_answer": "To find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q, we need to determine the number of elements in the extension that are not in the base field Q.\n\nFirst, let's look at the base field Q. Q is the set of all rational numbers, which includes the integers, fractions, and rational functions. The degree of Q over the prime field Q_p (where p is a prime number) is 1, since there is only one element in Q that is not in Q_p.\n\nNow let's consider the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). This is a quadratic field since it is generated by two elements: sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). The element sqrt(18) can be expressed as a combination of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3): sqrt(18) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3). Therefore, we only need to consider the extensions of Q by sqrt(2) and sqrt(3).\n\nThe extension of Q by sqrt(2) is the set of all numbers of the form a + b*sqrt(2), where a and b are rational numbers. There are infinitely many such numbers, which means that the degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is countably infinite.\n\nThe extension of Q by sqrt(3) is the set of all numbers of the form a + b*sqrt(3), where a and b are rational numbers. There are infinitely many such numbers, which means that the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also countably infinite.\n\nSince both extensions have the same degree as the base field, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 1. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n(A) 0",

            "model_answer": "To find the index of <p> in S_5, we first need to determine the number of distinct permutations generated by p. We can do this by finding the fix points of p (elements that remain unchanged after applying p) and then finding the orders of the orbits of the remaining elements.\n\nLet p = (1 2)(5)(4 3). We can see that 1 and 2 are fix points of p. Therefore, p^2 = (1 2)(5)(4 3)(1 2)(5)(4 3) = (1 2)(5). Now we need to find the order of the orbit of the remaining elements. Let's analyze the orders of p^3, p^4, and p^5:\n\np^3 = (1 2)(5 4)(3 1 2)(5 4) = p\np^4 = (1 2)(5 4)(3)(1 2)(5 4)(3) = (1 2)(5 4)\np^5 = (1 2)(5 4)(3)(1 2)(5 4) = (1 2)(5 4)\n\nWe can see that p^3, p^4, and p^5 have the same Cycle Structure as p, so the order of the orbit of the remaining elements is 3.\n\nNow we can find the index of <p> in S_5. The index of a subgroup is given by the formula |S_5|/|<p>|, where |S_5| is the order of the symmetric group and |<p>| is the order of the subgroup generated by p. The order of S_5 is 120, and we found that the order of <p> is 3. Therefore, the index of <p> in S_5 is:\n\n|S_5|/|<p>| = 120/3 = 40\n\nSo the answer is:\n(A) 8",
