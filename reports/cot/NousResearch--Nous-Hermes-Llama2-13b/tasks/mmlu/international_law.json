            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (A) The coastal State.\n\nIn general, a state's jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels within its territorial waters is known as the principle of \"hot pursuit.\" This principle allows the coastal state to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on board foreign vessels within its territorial waters.\n\nHowever, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and other international laws have established some exceptions to this principle. For example, the flag state may have jurisdiction over crimes committed on board its vessels in international waters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) The coastal State.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A) Justiciability refers to the possibility of enforcement of a particular right by the relevant rights holders.\n\nJusticiability is a legal term that refers to the ability of a party to bring a case or a claim before a court of law, and have it heard and decided upon by the court. It essentially refers to the legal standing or the capacity of a party to seek judicial relief for a particular right or claim. In other words, it is the ability to bring a lawsuit and have it adjudicated by the court.\n\nThe word \"justiciability\" comes from the Latin word \"justitia\" meaning justice or fairness. It is therefore, generally understood to refer to the ability to seek justice through the court system, by enforcing a particular right. Option (D) is incorrect as it suggests that justiciability is the obligation of the state to enforce a particular right, whereas justiciability is, in fact, the ability of a party to enforce their rights themselves.",

            "model_answer": "R2P is different from humanitarian intervention in the following way:\n\n(C) R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n\nWhile humanitarian intervention is mainly based on the idea of assisting people who are in need of help, R2P is more structured and involves a set of principles and criteria that need to be met before any action is taken. R2P requires the involvement of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which helps to ensure that the intervention is not arbitrary and is based on solid evidence of a humanitarian crisis. Additionally, R2P's primary objective is to prevent or stop a humanitarian crisis, whereas humanitarian intervention can be motivated by various reasons, including political or strategic interests.",
