            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) demographic momentum. \n\nExplanation: \nPopulation growth refers to the increase in number of individuals in a population over time. The concept of demographic momentum refers to a continuation of population growth even after the replacement fertility level has been reached. This means that even if the birth rate decreases to a level where it is just enough to replace the current population, the population will continue to grow due to the momentum generated by past high fertility rates. \n\nThis momentum becomes particularly significant when a population has undergone rapid growth in the past. As a result, the population continues to grow even though the rate of increase has slowed down significantly. \n\nTherefore, the tendency for a population to continue to grow long after replacement fertility has been achieved is called demographic momentum, and the correct option is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The tendency for migration to decrease with distance is called \n(C) distance decay. \n\nExplanation: \nMigration refers to the movement of people from one place to another. The idea that migration tends to decrease with distance is known as the \"distance decay\" theory. This theory suggests that as the distance between two locations increases, the likelihood of migration between them decreases. There are several factors that contribute to this phenomenon, including higher costs associated with traveling longer distances, cultural and linguistic barriers, and the reduced availability of employment opportunities. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) distance decay.",

            "model_answer": "In Burgess's concentric zone model of urban form, the inner city or the central business district is the zone that contains low-income slums, ethnic ghettos, and general deterioration. This is because the central business district was the first area to be developed in the city, and as the city grew and expanded, the central business district became obsolete and was replaced by newer, more modern areas. Over time, the central business district experienced a decline in population and economic activity, leading to the development of low-income housing and ethnic ghettos.",

            "model_answer": "(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia \n\nReasoning: \n\n(A) Most women work in agriculture - FALSE. According to the International Labour Organization, only 27% of women work in agriculture, while 52% of men work in agriculture. \n\n(B) The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide - TRUE. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2020, the global average for women's labor force participation rate (LFPR) was 55.4% in 2020. This is a decrease from the previous year's global average of 56.4%.\n\n(C) The percentage of women in the total labor force declined - TRUE. This is a direct consequence of part (B) as the percentage of women in the total labor force declined due to the decrease in labor force participation rate. \n\n(D) Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia - FALSE.

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) overcrowding. \n\nOvercrowding is typically considered a push factor of migration, which means it drives people to leave their original location. Push factors are usually negative factors that make it difficult or unpleasant for people to stay in their original location, such as war, poverty, natural disasters or overcrowding. In contrast, pull factors are positive reasons that attract people to migrate to a new location, such as better job opportunities, higher wages, safety, better climate or better schools. \n\nTherefore, the statement \"overcrowding is a pull factor of migration\" is incorrect.",

In order to determine which of the countries listed does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary, we need to analyze each country's history and former territorial extent.\n\n(A) Vietnam: Vietnam's current borders were established after the French and Japanese invasions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, Vietnam has had several changes in its territory throughout its history, particularly during the Chinese and Khmer invasions. Therefore, Vietnam has a well-known example of a relict boundary.\n\n(B) United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has several well-known examples of relict boundaries, including the English Channel, which was once a land bridge connecting Britain and Europe, and the Irish Sea, which separated Scotland from Ireland during the last Ice Age.\n\n(C) Germany: Germany also has several well-known examples of relict boundaries, including the Oder-Neisse line, which was the eastern border of Germany before World War II and is now the border between Germany and Poland.\n\n(D) Bolivia: Bolivia's current borders were established after the country's war of independence from Spain in the early 19th century. Bolivia has had several changes in its territory throughout its history, particularly during the Spanish and Portuguese colonization. However, Bolivia does not have a well-known example of a relict boundary compared to the other options listed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(D) Bolivia",

In the context of a country, a centrifugal force can be anything that causes the citizens or regions to move away or separate from the center of power.\n\nA charismatic national leader can be a centrifugal force because such a leader can cause citizens and regions to rally behind them, causing the country to divide into factions that support the leader and those that do not.

            "model_answer": "The best answer to this question is (D) Access to trade routes. \n\nCoastlines and rivers have historically been important locations for trade, as they provide easy access to waterways for transporting goods. This allowed early settlements to thrive and grow, as they could trade with other cities and communities. In addition, coastlines and riverbanks often have fertile soil, which could support high population densities. \n\nWhile (A) Mediterranean climate may have been more hospitable to certain crops, it does not directly explain why early settlements developed along coastlines and rivers. Similarly, (C) Growth of manufacturing may have led to more settlements, but it does not explain why they formed along specific geographical features. And (B) Limited forest cover may have made it easier for early humans to clear land and build settlements, but it does not explain why they chose to build them in specific locations.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (D) Access to trade routes.",
