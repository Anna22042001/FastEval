We can use the predicates Txy to represent \"x teaches y\" and c:Chris to represent \"Chris.\" We can use the variable d to represent \"David.\" \n\nStarting from the end of the sentence, we have \"d\" (David). Since this is a new entity, we can introduce a new constant \"d\" to represent him. However, since \"David\" has already been mentioned in the sentence, we can also replace \"d\" with \"David\" in the predicate.\n\nNow coming to \"teaches\" we can use the predefined predicate Txy.\n\nFinally, we have Chris represented by \"Chris\" which is already a constant. \n\nPutting all this information together, the best translation into predicate logic for the given sentence would be:\n\n(A) Tdc\n(B) Tcd\n(C) Tcc\n(D) dTc\n\nThe final answer is: (A) Tdc.",
