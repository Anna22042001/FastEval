            "model_answer": "The responsibility to remain sovereign is not an element of the responsibility to protect.\n\nExplanation: \nThe responsibility to protect (RtoP) is a global political commitment to prevent and Address the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. It is based on three pillars: the responsibility to prevent, the responsibility to react, and the responsibility to rebuild. However, the responsibility to remain sovereign is not part of these pillars, and in fact, the RtoP concept challenges the notion of sovereignty in cases where there is a risk of atrocities being committed against civilians. Therefore, option (C) is the answer.",

            "question": "Can environmental changes be reconciled with national security interests?\n\n(A) Environmental challenges to economic growth, such as natural resource management and employment, leads to diversification and research which may in the long-term result in technological advancements that bolster military programs.\n(B) Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.\n(C) The environmental problems encountered by countries are principally internal. External threats remain within a country's control: external military threats will remain unchanged and a primary concern.\n(D) All of these options.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) All of these options. Environmental changes can be reconciled with national security interests in different ways depending on the context and perspective. Option A highlights the potential for environmental challenges to drive economic diversification and technological advancements that can support military programs. Option B recognizes the potential for environmental degradation to undermine national security by weakening the economic base necessary for maintaining military capacity. Option C acknowledges that internal environmental problems may be of greater concern to some countries, whereas external threats may be a more significant concern for others. Overall, reconciling environmental changes with national security interests requires a nuanced approach that considers the specific context and priorities of each country.",

            "question": "Which of the following statements could be described as a liberal perspective on future energy security?\n\n(A) The global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.\n(B) Energy scarcity is likely to lead to future disruptions in the global system and the emergence of a 'new international energy order', characterized less by liberal free-market trading than by statism and neo-mercantilism.\n(C) Oil remains the lifeblood of the current order - an order that is based upon an unequal (and deeply unjust) distribution of wealth and power in favour of capitalist economic elites. Those who benefit most from the prevailing order will ensure that the flow of energy under favourable conditions continues to underpin their position in the global system.\n(D) Energy scarcity will signal a return to an era of greater geopolitical confrontation. 'Resource wars', in particular over energy sources, present a clear possibility for a breakdown in international cooperation, as states begin to compete (and eventually conflict) over the control of major reserves.",

Proponents of this view argue that the human security concept encompasses so many different issues and aspects of human life that it becomes difficult to prioritize or address any specific ones effectively. Additionally, this criticism suggests that the concept is too vague and lacks a clear definition, making it difficult to implement in practice.

            "question": "In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?\n\n(A) State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\n(B) With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\n(C) The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\n(D) The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.",

Security studies became one of International Relations' (IR's) two pillars, the second being International Political Economy. Henceforth IR became the main disciplinary context in which security studies was deliberated.\n(D) Think tanks and policymakers are increasingly interrelated.

Trade Liberalization: reduce tariffs and other restrictions on imports and exports.\n3. Privatization: precede state enterprises and their assets to the private sector to increase efficiency and competition.\n4. Interest Rate Liberalization: adjusting interest rates to market levels to control inflation, promote savings, and attract capital.\n5. Currency Convertibility: allowing the domestic currency to be converted to a freely usable international currency.\n6. Deregulation: eliminating government Barriers to trade, investment, and market entry.\n7.

Paying Social Security and Health Care: strengthening social security and health care systems to reduce poverty and vulnerability.\n\nNationalization, which is the protection of state enterprises, goes against the privatization step recommended by the Washington Consensus.

One of the main objectives of this strategy is to ensure the stability of oil-rich regions and secure the economic and political status quo. To achieve this, the USA has deployed troops in the Persian Gulf region, which is home to some of the world's largest oil reserves. This deployment has helped the USA to assert its dominance in the region and protect its interests.\nIn addition to military interventions, the USA has also actively sought to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors and secure the economic and political status quo. This has involved the provision of military and economic aid to these actors, as well as the pursuit of policies that promote economic and political stability.\nFinally, the USA's strategy has also involved the assertion of its primacy vis-\u00e0-vis friendly and rival powers. This has been achieved through a combination of military interventions, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure. The deployment of troops and other interventions have helped the USA to assert its dominance and protect its interests in the oil-rich regions.\nTherefore, the answer is (D) The USA has actively sought to stabilize oil-rich friendly political actors and secure the economic and political status quo.
