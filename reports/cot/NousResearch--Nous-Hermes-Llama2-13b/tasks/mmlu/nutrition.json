            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "It is difficult to determine the specific foods that are consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland as of 2020 without researching and analyzing dietary habits and trends in these regions. However, based on general cultural and geographical factors, one can make some educated guesses.\n\nIn Wales and Scotland, the climate is not particularly conducive to growing large quantities of fruits and vegetables, so it is not unreasonable to think that these might be consumed in lower quantities compared to other countries with warmer and more fertile climates. Additionally, in these regions, there is a history of meat production and consumption, particularly lamb and beef, so it is possible that meat consumption may be higher than the average in other countries.\n\nThe final answer to this question can only be determined by analyzing actual data and trends, but based on the given options and cultural factors, the best choice would be:\n\n(D) Potatoes.",

            "model_answer": "The prevalence of a disease in the population will increase under the following circumstances:\n\n(D) If the population in which the disease is measured increases.\n\nExplanation: Prevalence refers to the number of cases of a disease that are present in a particular population at a given time. If the population in which the disease is measured increases, then there will be more individuals within that population who could potentially contract the disease. As a result, the number of currently ill individuals (the prevalence) will also increase, even if nothing changes with regards to the incidence rate, survival time, or recovery rate of the disease.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "This is a multiple-choice question, and we need to determine which statement is correct.\n\nStep 1: Let's analyze Statement A.\nThe flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids. \nThis statement is correct. Flavonoids are a group of naturally occurring plant pigments and they are further classified into different subgroups, one of which is the isoflavonoids subgroup.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze Statement B.\nThe digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones in soya food products are not changed by processing.\nThis statement is partly true. The processing of soy food products can affect the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones. For example, fermentation of soybeans (e.g., in the production of miso or tempeh) can increase the bioavailability of isoflavones. However, other processing methods (e.g., cooking, roasting) can decrease the bioavailability of isoflavones.\n\nStep 3: Let's analyze Statement C.\nWhen analyzing Statement C, we can see that:\n- \u03b2-carotene is a type of carotenoid, which is a class of pigments found in many plants and algae. It is an antioxidant and has vitamin A activity.\n- Lycopene is also a carotenoid and has antioxidant properties. It is found in tomatoes and other red fruits.\n- While both \u03b2-carotene and lycopene have antioxidant properties, \u03b2-carotene can act as a provitamin A because it can be converted into vitamin A in the body. Lycopene, however, cannot.\nTherefore, Statement C is incorrect.\n\nStep 4: Let's analyze Statement D.\nCarotenoids and flavonoids both belong to the polyphenol class.\nThis statement is incorrect. While both carotenoids and flavonoids are classes of plant pigments, they do not belong to the same class. Polyphenols are a large group of naturally occurring chemicals, including flavonoids, but not carotenoids. Carotenoids are a class of pigments that include \u03b2-carotene, lycopene, and other red, orange, and yellow pigments found in fruits and vegetables.\n\nTherefore, out of the given options, the correct statement is:\n\nA. The flavonoid class comprises flavonoids and isoflavonoids.",

            "model_answer": "The main causes of the obesity epidemic are (A) increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style. In the modern world, people tend to consume more calorie-dense food with little to no nutritional value, and they also spend more time sitting down, which reduces their energy expenditure. These two factors combine to contribute significantly to the rise in obesity rates. (B) Decreased leisure time activity and (C) changes in genetic profiles are not as significant causes of the obesity epidemic compared to (A).

            "model_answer": "Each of the given options contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults. \n\n(A) Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor: As people age, the production of stomach acid decreases, which in turn reduces the secretion of intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.\n\n(B) Atrophic gastritis: This is a condition where the stomach lining becomes thinner and inflamed due to the decrease in stomach acid production. This can lead to reduced absorption of vitamin B12 from the small intestine.\n\n(C) Helicobacter pylori infection: This is a bacterial infection that can cause inflammation of the stomach lining and decrease in stomach acid production, further reducing the absorption of vitamin B12 from the small intestine.\n\nSo, the answer is (D) All of the above.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The hormone thought to mediate the effect of obesity on endometrial cancer is (B) Oestrogen. \n\nReasoning:\nObesity is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, and this relationship is thought to be mediated by hormonal factors. One of the primary hormones involved in endometrial cancer development is oestrogen. High levels of oestrogen stimulate the growth and division of endometrial cells, leading to the development of cancer. \n\nObesity is associated with increased levels of oestrogen in several ways. One key factor is that adipose tissue (body fat) can convert other hormones, such as androgens, into oestrogen through a process called aromatization. Obesity can also cause an increase in insulin resistance, which in turn can lead to higher levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Elevated IGF-1 levels can stimulate the production of oestrogen in the endometrium, further increasing the risk of cancer.\n\nTherefore, the hormone thought to mediate the effect of obesity on endometrial cancer is oestrogen.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The vitamin required for calcium absorption from the small intestine is Vitamin D. \n\nReasoning: \nCalcium absorption from the small intestine occurs primarily in the terminal ileum, where it is facilitated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D). Calcitriol binds to its receptor on the intestinal cells, allowing calcium to be absorbed. While all the vitamins listed play important roles in various bodily functions, only Vitamin D is directly involved in calcium absorption.\n\nAnswer:\n(B) Vitamin D",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is correct, let's examine each one:\n\n(A) The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages.\nThis statement assumes that the amino acid requirements for adults are the same for all ages, which is not necessarily true. Amino acid requirements can vary depending on factors such as age, sex, and physical activity levels.\n\n(B) The amino acid requirements determined for adults is assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.\nThis statement is more accurate than (A) because it recognizes that amino acid requirements can vary by age. However, it still assumes that the requirements for adults are the same for all ages, which may not be the case.\n\n(C) The amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children.\nThis statement is partially correct. Breast milk provides a good source of essential amino acids for infants, but it is not the only source of amino acids for children as they grow older. Additionally, the amino acid requirements for children may change as they age, so it's necessary to consider other factors as well.\n\n(D) The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.\nThis statement is also partially correct. The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein can be used as a reference for establishing dietary requirements for infants and young children. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as the child's growth rate, age, and physical activity levels when determining their specific amino acid requirements.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.",
