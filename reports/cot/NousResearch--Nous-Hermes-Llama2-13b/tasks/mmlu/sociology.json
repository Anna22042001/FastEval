            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer to this question is (D) audiences make selective interpretations of media messages. \n\nMass-society theory is a perspective within sociology that examines the role of mass media in contemporary society. One of the key ideas of this theory is that mass media has a significant impact on shaping public opinion and behavior. However, the theory also suggests that audiences are not passive recipients of media messages, but rather they actively engage with media content and interpret it in their own way. \n\nAudiences are seen as selective in their interpretation of media messages, meaning that they choose what information they want to accept and what they want to reject. This selective interpretation depends on many factors, such as the viewer's personal experiences, beliefs, values, and social context. Therefore, the theory suggests that audiences have some level of agency and are not simply manipulated by the media.\n\nAnswer: D.",

It provides an alternative to incarceration, helping to reduce prison overcrowding.\n\nOption C: \"monitor employees' activities at work\"\nCCTV cameras, computer monitoring software, and other surveillance tools have made it easier for employers to keep track of their employees' activities at work. This can help prevent theft, monitor productivity, and ensure compliance with company policies.\n\nStep 2: Now let's evaluate which option covers all the mentioned points.\n\nOption D: \"all of the above\"\nThis option covers all the points mentioned in the other options.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's understand the concepts:\n\n1. Gemeinschaft: According to T\u00f6nnies, Gemeinschaft is a social structure in which individuals have a strong sense of community and shared values, and personal relationships are valued over efficiency.\n2. Organic Solidarity: Represents a social structure where individuals are interdependent and have a shared sense of identity, meaning that their interests are intertwined, similar to the organs in a body functioning together.\n3. Mechanical Solidarity: This refers to a social structure based on the division of labor, where individuals work together in a coordinated and interdependent manner to achieve a common goal.\n4. Gesellschaft: This is a social structure characterized by the absence of strong communal bonds and relationships, where individuals are self-interested and pursue their own goals without regard for the community as a whole.\n5. Anomie: This refers to a state of strain or disorientation in society, where individuals do not have a clear set of values or goals to guide their behavior.\n\nNow, let's determine which concept is most similar to Gemeinschaft:\n\nA. Organic Solidarity and Gemeinschaft share the idea of a strong sense of community and shared values, where individuals have interdependent relationships.\nB. Mechanical Solidarity focuses on the division of labor and interdependence, but not on the communal bonds and shared values.\nC. Gesellschaft emphasizes the absence of communal bonds and shared values, which is the opposite of Gemeinschaft.\nD. Anomie is characterized by a lack of clear values or goals, which is different from the strong sense of community and shared values present in Gemeinschaft.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.

            "question": "There was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because:\n\n(A) rates of income tax increased equally for all occupational groups\n(B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them\n(C) the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings\n(D) growing unemployment made more people dependent on welfare benefits",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them. \n\nIncome inequality refers to the uneven distribution of income among different groups in society. The growth in income inequality in the 1980s can be attributed to several factors. However, the most significant factor was the change in the job market, which favored professional jobs while leaving behind low-paying jobs.\n\nThe 1980s was a period of rapid technological advancement, globalization, and deregulation, which created new opportunities in the market. However, these opportunities were primarily concentrated in professional jobs such as finance, consulting, and technology. These jobs offered high salaries and good benefits, attracting people with high levels of education and skills.\n\nAt the same time, there were not enough people with the skills and education required to fill these jobs. This led to a mismatch between the supply and demand for labor, with high-paying jobs remaining unfilled while low-paying jobs were overcrowded. As a result, income inequality grew as the people who could not access professional jobs were left behind.\n\nAnswer: B",

            "model_answer": "The correct explanation is option (B) sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually. \n\nAccording to Marxist feminists, patriarchy is characterized by the establishment of sex classes. In this system, men are seen as the dominant group, while women are relegated to a subordinate position. This power imbalance is maintained through various means, such as economic exploitation, political oppression, and sexual domination. Men are said to control the means of production and reproduction, which gives them greater access to resources and power. Women, on the other hand, are often marginalized in the workforce and relegated to unpaid domestic labor, which reinforces their subordinate status. By understanding patriarchy as an unjust system of sex classes, Marxist feminists seek to dismantle the oppressive structures that perpetuate gender inequality.",
