            "question": "One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.\n(B) admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.\n(C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n(D) inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.\n\nThe attorney-client privilege is a legal principle that protects the confidentiality of communications between a client and their attorney. This privilege is designed to encourage clients to be fully honest with their attorneys and to enable attorneys to provide informed legal advice. The privilege applies to all communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or assistance from an attorney.\n\nIn this case, the consulting attorney had a privileged communication with the boy and his father during preliminary discussions regarding the case. The purpose of this communication was to obtain legal advice or assistance. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege applies, and the attorney's testimony regarding the boy's physical condition is inadmissible.\n\nAnswer: (C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.",

            "question": "A state statute provides: \"Whenever a person knows or should know that he (or she) is being arrested by a police officer, it is the duty of such person to refrain from using force or any weapon in resisting arrest. \" Violation of the statute is made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. One morning, there was a bank robbery in the state. That afternoon, a police officer arrested a suspect who he believed was involved in the crime. However, the police officer and the suspect have given different accounts concerning what happened next. According to the police officer, after the suspect was apprehended, he resisted arrest and hit the police officer in the mouth with his fist. The police officer, who was momentarily stunned, pulled out his nightstick and struck the suspect over the head with it. On the other hand, the suspect claimed that after he was arrested, he cursed at the policeman, whereupon the police officer began hitting the suspect with his nightstick. To avoid being hit again, the suspect hit the police officer with his fist, knocking him down. The suspect was charged with assault. The suspect should be found\n\n(A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(B) not guilty, if the arrest was lawful, provided that the jury believes the suspect's account.\n(C) guilty, if the arrest was lawful, regardless which account the jury believes.\n(D) guilty, if the arrest was unlawful, regardless which account the jury believes.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The key issue in this case is whether the arrest was lawful or unlawful. If the arrest was unlawful, then the suspect's resistance was justified, and any subsequent use of force by the police officer would not be justified. On the other hand, if the arrest was lawful, then the suspect's use of force to resist arrest would be unlawful.\n\nThe suspect's claim that the arrest was unlawful without probable cause would depend on whether the police officer had probable cause to arrest the suspect for the bank robbery. If the police officer had probable cause, then the arrest was lawful, and the suspect's Use of force to resist arrest would be unlawful.\n\nIf the jury believes the suspect's account and finds that the arrest was unlawful without probable cause, then the suspect should be found (A) not guilty, regardless of whether the jury believes the suspect's account of the events that occurred after the arrest.\n\nIf the jury believes the police officer's account and finds that the arrest was lawful, then the suspect should be found (B) not guilty, if the jury believes the suspect's account of events that occurred after the arrest. This is because the suspect would have a defense to the assault charge based on self-defense or defense of others.\n\nIf the jury believes the police officer's account and finds that the arrest was lawful, then the suspect should be found (C) guilty, regardless of whether the jury believes the suspect's account of events that occurred after the arrest.\n\nIf the jury believes the suspect's account and finds that the arrest was unlawful, then the suspect should be found (D) not guilty, regardless of whether the jury believes the suspect's account of events that occurred after the arrest. This is because the suspect would have a defense to the assault charge based on resistance to unlawful arrest.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (A) not guilty, if the arrest was unlawful without probable cause and the jury believes the suspect's account.",

The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him.

As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another.

            "question": "A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order\n\n(A) valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.",

However, this assumption is not based on any legal or constitutional principle.\n\n(B) valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\nThis option assumes that the President has the authority to require federal employees to perform emergency functions, including those outside their normal job responsibilities. This assumption is based on the idea that federal employees are obliged to follow legal orders from their superiors, but it does not address the question of whether the President has the authority to issue such orders in the first place.\n\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\nThis option assumes that the President can only issue executive orders within the scope of his powers, and that he requires congressional authorization to exceed those powers. This option is based on the principle of separation of powers and the system of checks and balances established by the US Constitution.\n\n(D) invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.\nThis option assumes that the President does not have the authority to issue directives to federal agencies under the supervision of the INS, and that this authority lies with the director of the INS. This assumption is based on the organization and structure of the INS and the federal government, but it does not address the question of whether the President has the authority to issue such directives in the first place.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the correct answer is:\n\n(C) invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.",

The man and his purported second wife bought a home together as tenants by the entirety. They lived there together for a few years, when the man was accused and convicted of killing his purported wife. He was given a life sentence. The decedent's estate brought a quiet title action to declare the property forfeited to the decedent on the basis that a murderer cannot benefit from his crime. The trial court awarded the property to the estate. The man appealed from his prison cell. Under the common law, will the appellate court affirm the trial court's decision and strip the man of all ownership rights in the home?\n\n(A) Yes, because a murderer cannot reap the benefits of his ill-doing.\n(B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n(C) No, the court will as a policy matter recognize the murderer's pre-slaying right to one-half of the property as a tenant in common.\n(D) No, there is no rule of law that gives the victim or her estate any additional rights in the property that she had before the homicide.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B) Yes, because the murderer was also a bigamist who could not take good title to the property in the first place, thus putting full title in the decedent from the date of purchase.\n\nThe reasoning behind this answer is as follows:\n\nFirstly, the man was still legally married to his first wife at the time of his supposed second marriage, making it a bigamous marriage. In juridical systems based on common law, bigamy is a crime that can forfeit any property rights that the criminal may have. Therefore, the second wife's claim to the property is invalidated.\n\nSecondly, under the doctrine of tenancy by the entirety, the husband and wife own the property as tenants by the entirety, meaning that both spouses must be living and competent in order to transfer, encumber or will the property. Since the man is a convicted murderer and is no longer living, he cannot claim possession of the property. Therefore, the remaining tenant (the deceased wife) holds the entirety of the property.\n\nThirdly, since the man cannot claim possession of the property due to his conviction for murder, the decedent's estate can successfully claim that the man has no ownership rights in the home. The fact that the man was awarded half of the property as a tenant in common does not give him any rights to the property, as he cannot own property that is subject to forfeiture due to his conviction for murder.\n\nTherefore, appellate court is likely to affirm the trial court's decision, strip the man of all ownership rights in the home, and award the property to the decedent's estate.",
