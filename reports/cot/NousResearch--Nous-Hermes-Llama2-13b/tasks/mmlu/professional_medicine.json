            "question": "A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n\n(A) Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\n(B) Complication of the IVC filter placement\n(C) Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\n(D) Hematoma of the left thigh",

            "model_answer": "The most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is (C) compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. \n\nStep 1: Consider the patient's medical history and current complaints. She had a pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, IVC filter placement, and a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. She also reports a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital. \n\nStep 2: Eliminate option (A) cerebral infarction during the hospitalization as it is an unrelated event and the patient did not report any neurological deficits. \n\nStep 3: Eliminate option (B) complication of the IVC filter placement, as the patient had the filter placed 2 weeks ago and the decreased sensation has been present since then. \n\nStep 4: Eliminate option (D) hematoma of the left thigh, as the hematoma was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. \n\nStep 5: The remaining option is (C) compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The decreased sensation to light touch over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh is consistent with compression of this nerve. The patient did not report this complaint in the hospital, but it may have developed after the placement of the IVC filter. \n\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",

            "model_answer": "Based on the information provided, it seems that the patient is in active labor at 39 weeks' gestation with a engagement of the fetal head, intact membranes, normal fetal heart tones, and a cervix that is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. However, she is experiencing only intermittent, weak contractions, which has led to a delay in progress.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for this delay, including Braxton Hicks contractions, lower uterine retraction ring, hypotonic uterine dysfunction, or primary dysfunctional labor. \n\nBraxton Hicks contractions are usually painless and do not cause dilatation of the cervix. Since the patient is already dilated, this option can be ruled out.\n\nLower uterine retraction ring is a condition where the muscle of the uterus contracts and forms a ring around the neck of the fetus. This can cause pain and delay labor progress. However, the patient has already received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which suggests that her pain is not due to this condition.\n\nHypotonic uterine dysfunction is a condition where the uterus does not contract effectively, leading to slow or delayed labor progress. However, the patient is already having regular contractions every 4 minutes, which suggests that her uterus is contracting effectively.\n\nprimary dysfunctional labor is a condition where the uterus does not start contractions during labor, leading to a delay in labor progress. However, the patient is already in active labor, which suggests that she does not have this condition.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is:\n\n(D) primary dysfunctional labor",

            "model_answer": "Based on the symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of the numbness and tingling in the right hand is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist. \nThe median nerve travels through the carpal tunnel in the wrist and provides sensory and motor function to the hand. Compression or entrapment of this nerve can cause the symptoms described in the question. The jolt of severe pain in the right ring and small fingers when palpating the right elbow is consistent with median nerve entrapment. The decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the medial half of the right ring finger and the entire small finger is also a classic sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. \nThe other options listed in the question are less likely causes of the symptoms. The musculocutaneous nerve and radial nerve do not travel through the carpal tunnel and are not as likely to cause the described symptoms. The ulnar nerve is another nerve that travels through the arm and wrist, but its entrapment typically causes symptoms in the hand and fingers on the opposite side, not the right side as described in this question. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist, and the answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The increased malonyl-CoA concentration is most likely directly inhibiting fatty acid oxidation (A) in these subjects. \n\nMalonyl-CoA is an intermediate in the process of fatty acid synthesis. It is generated by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in response to high levels of insulin and glucose. When malonyl-CoA concentrations are high, it binds to and inhibits the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), which is responsible for transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation (fatty acid oxidation). This inhibition of CPT-1 prevents fatty acids from entering the mitochondria and being oxidized for energy production, leading to the accumulation of fatty acids in the cytosol. \n\nThe other processes mentioned in the question (fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis) are also affected by high levels of malonyl-CoA, but they are indirectly affected through the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. Since the question asks for the process that is directly inhibited by the increased malonyl-CoA concentration, the answer is (A) Fatty acid oxidation.",

Current medications also include oxycodone (10 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), and fluoxetine (20 mg/d). She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2 .

            "model_answer": "(B) Assess for suicidal ideation is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nReasoning:\nThe patient has advanced ovarian cancer with liver metastasis, which can cause significant pain and emotional distress. Despite receiving chemotherapy for 2 years, she remains symptomatic and is now experiencing depression due to her condition. She rates her pain as a 1 to 2 on a 10-point scale, which is relatively mild, but her level of distress suggests that her pain may be underestimated. Additionally, the patient has hypertension and major depressive disorder, both of which increase the risk of suicidal ideation. \nTherefore, it is important to assess for suicidal ideation as the next step in management. This will allow the physician to determine the patient's risk and develop appropriate interventions, such as mental health counseling or referral to a hospital setting for further evaluation and treatment. While reassurance may be beneficial, it is not enough to address the patient's underlying emotional distress. Increasing the oxycodone dosage may provide some relief from pain, but it is not a long-term solution, and the risk of addiction and other side effects must be considered. Beginning dextroamphetamine therapy is not indicated in this situation, as it is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, not cancer-related pain or depression.",
