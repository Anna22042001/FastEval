            "question": "Which of the following methods of detecting breast cancer involves exposure to radiation?\n\n(A) Needle aspiration\n(B) Mammography\n(C) Mastectomy\n(D) Lumpectomy",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The only method of detecting breast cancer from the options given that involves exposure to radiation is (B) Mammography. Mammography uses low-dose X-ray radiation to take images of the breast to detect cancer or other abnormalities. While it does involve exposure to radiation, it is generally considered to be a safe and effective method of breast cancer detection, as the benefits of early detection often outweigh the risks associated with radiation exposure.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyzing the options\n(A) vary from person to person - This is a subjective fact and there is no right or wrong answer. So it could be true for some people and not for others.\n(B) vary for women depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle - This is also true as the levels of progesterone and estrogen change throughout the menstrual cycle, which can affect sexual arousal and sensitivity to stimuli.\n(C) are mainly on the lower portion of the body - This is not entirely accurate as sexual arousal can occur in different regions of the body for different people, including the upper body, face, and head.\n \nStep 2: Evaluating the options\nTherefore, the correct option is (D) all of the above. This is because the regions of the body that are sexually exciting can vary from person to person, and for women, they can also vary depending on the phases of the menstrual cycle. Additionally, sexual arousal can occur in different regions of the body for different people.",

            "question": "You are a homosexual male: Last night, you were tempted by lusty, swarthy Jacques (the king of fraternity row) to join him at the local dairy bar for a tall cool glass of milk. You also briefly considered studying for this test, but Jacques won out. In Freudian terms, which of the following was dominant?\n\n(A) the id\n(B) the ego\n(C) the superego\n(D) the Oedipus complex",

            "model_answer": "In this scenario, the id was the dominant force. The id is the instinctual and primitive part of the psyche that seeks instant gratification without regard for consequence. The temptation of lusty, swarthy Jacques and the desire for a tall cool glass of milk at the local dairy bar represents the id's urges for pleasure and gratification. Studying for the test, on the other hand, represents the ego's attempt to balance the id's impulses with rational thought and responsibility. However, in this case, the id's desires won out over the ego's efforts to control them. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the id.",

            "model_answer": "Option (B) evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli is the correct answer. \n\nSociobiologists believe that there are more males than females with paraphilias because evolutionary selection has favored the development of males who respond to novel sexual stimuli. This means that males who have a predisposition towards unusual sexual behaviors are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation, leading to a higher frequency of paraphilias among males. This answer is based on the idea that paraphilias are a result of sexual selection and not necessarily advantageous for survival or reproduction.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "According to attachment theory, Joe's behavior in relationships points towards him being an avoidant lover. This is because Joe seems to have a fear of intimacy and closeness in relationships, which is a characteristic of avoidant attachers. They often keep others at a distance and may not express their feelings openly, which is evident in Joe's desperate advances towards Helen. Despite his desire for a partnership, he seems to push Helen away due to his fear of rejection or vulnerability.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "As a scientist, I can tell you that there is no strong evidence to suggest that children's play preferences at a young age can predict their later sexual orientation. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about Bruce's or Chuck's play preferences as children based on their current sexual orientation. \n\nHowever, if we were to speculate on the possible differences in play preferences between Bruce and Chuck based on their gender identities, we might expect that Bruce would have participated in more female-typical play and Chuck would have participated in more male-typical play. This is because gender identity is often influenced by society's expectations for masculinity and femininity, which can shape a person's interests and behaviors. \n\nHowever, it is also important to note that children's play preferences are influenced by many factors, including their own innate interests and desires, as well as the social environment they grow up in. Therefore, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about Bruce's or Chuck's play preferences without more information.\n\nSo, based on the available information, we cannot make a confident prediction about any of the options provided.",
