            "question": "You bought a limousine for $98,000 and are planning to rent it for weddings, ceremonies and parties at $245 per hour. If you estimate the car will be hired for 2 hours a day on average, with daily costs at about $50, what is the estimated yearly yield on your investment if you work all year round, i.e. every day of the year, including any festivities and weekends?\n\n(A) 164%\n(B) 1.64%\n(C) 0.45%\n(D) 183%",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, we first need to determine the total income from renting the limousine.\nIf the limousine is rented for 2 hours a day, then in one day it will generate $245 x 2 = $490 worth of income.\nSince there are 365 days in a year, the total income from renting the limousine for the year would be $490 x 365 = $183,725.\nHowever, there are additional costs associated with running the business such as daily costs of about $50. Let's assume that these costs amount to $50 x 365 = $18,250 per year.\nTo calculate the net income from the investment, we can subtract the annual costs from the total income. Net income = Total income - Annual costs = $183,725 - $18,250 = $165,475.\nWe can then calculate the percentage yield on the investment by dividing the net income by the initial cost of the limousine and multiplying by 100%. \nPercentage yield = (Net income / Initial cost) x 100% = ($165,475 / $98,000) x 100% = 1.6828 x 100% = 168.28%.\nTherefore, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is approximately 168.28%.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) Understated Understated.\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf Arno Co. did not record a credit purchase of merchandise made prior to year end, it means that the purchase was not reflected in the company's accounting records. However, the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory.\n\nIn this case, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise would have an effect on Arno's balance sheet at year end.\n\nUnderstated Assets\nThe purchase of merchandise is an asset, and since it was not recorded in the accounting records, the asset section of the balance sheet would be understated.\n\nUnderstated Liabilities\nThe purchase of merchandise is also a liability, as it represents an obligation to pay for the goods received. Since the purchase was not recorded, the liability section of the balance sheet would be understated.\n\nTherefore, the effect of the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise on Arno's balance sheet at year end is Understated Assets and Understated Liabilities.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end.\n\nAn auditor would generally perform this procedure regarding subsequent events because it helps to identify any significant transactions that occurred after the year end but before the release of the financial statements. This can include important events like significant sales or purchases, loans or borrowings, or other transactions that could have a material impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe other options mentioned are also important procedures that an auditor would perform, but they are not specifically related to subsequent events. (A) Inspecting inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end is important to ensure that the inventory balance is accurate, but it does not necessarily relate to subsequent events. (B) Testing internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate is a crucial procedure to improve the effectiveness of internal controls, but it is not directly related to subsequent events. (D) Comparing the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited is an important procedure to ensure consistency and accuracy across financial statements, but it also does not specifically relate to subsequent events.",

            "model_answer": "The error in using the straight-line method instead of the effective interest method to amortize the premium will result in an overstatement of the bond carrying amount at June 30 year 12. This is because the effective interest method accelerates the recognition of interest revenue, leading to a higher amortization expense in the earlier years and a lower amortization expense in the later years. \nTo determine the impact on the retained earnings, we need to compare the interest expense and amortization of the premium under the effective interest method and the straight-line method for the entire term of the bond. \nUnder the effective interest method, the total interest expense and amortization of the premium over the life of the bond would be higher than under the straight-line method. As a result, Dean Co.'s retained earnings would be overstated at June 30 year 12 if they had used the effective interest method. \nTherefore, the answer is:\n(A) Overstated",
