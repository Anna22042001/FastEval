            "model_answer": "A Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal rearrangement that occurs when a piece of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome at a different location. This process does not involve the telomeres, centromeres, or histones.\n\nThe fusion occurs at the ends of the long arms of two non-homologous chromosomes. In a typical Robertsonian translocation, the long arm of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to the short arm of another chromosome. This creates a new hybrid chromosome with a mixed up arm structure. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n(D) ends of the long arms.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the expected frequency of affected females, we will use the concept of genetic inheritance and the Hardy-Weinberg principle. Since the condition is X-linked recessive, affected males will have two copies of the recessive allele (XX), while affected females will have one copy of the recessive allele and one copy of the normal allele (XR).\n\nThe frequency of the recessive allele in the male population is 0.10, but since females have two X chromosomes, they require two copies of the recessive allele to be affected (XX). Therefore, the frequency of affected females can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle:\n\np^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1\n\nIn this case, p is the frequency of the recessive allele, q is the frequency of the normal allele, and p^2 represents the frequency of affected males (XX), 2pq represents the frequency of carriers (XR), and q^2 represents the frequency of normal females (RR).\n\n0.10^2 + 2(0.10)(0.90) + 0.90^2 = 1\n\n0.01 + 0.18 + 0.81 = 1\n\n1 = 1\n\nSince the equation is true, the frequency of affected females is 0.01 or 1%.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To determine the pattern of inheritance for malignant hyperthermia (hyperpyrexia), we need to consider the mode of inheritance and the type of gene involved. Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic disorder, and it is known that it is caused by mutations in the RyR1 gene, which encodes a protein called the ryanodine receptor. This gene is located on chromosome 19.\n\nTo decide which pattern of inheritance best fits this condition, we can use the following guidelines:\n\n1. If the gene is located on an autosome and its expression is equal in males and females, the pattern of inheritance is likely to be autosomal dominant.\n\n2. If the gene is located on an autosome and its expression is different in males and females, the pattern of inheritance is likely to be autosomal recessive.\n\n3. If the gene is located on the X chromosome and its expression is equal in males and females, the pattern of inheritance is likely to be X-linked dominant.\n\n4. If the gene is located on the X chromosome and its expression is different in males and females, the pattern of inheritance is likely to be X-linked recessive.\n\nIn this case, since the RyR1 gene is located on chromosome 19, which is an autosome, the pattern of inheritance is likely to be autosomal dominant. This is the correct answer, so the final answer is:\n\nA) autosomal dominant.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "If a mother has untreated phenylketonuria, it means that she has a high level of phenylalanine in her blood. This can be passed on to her child through breast milk or her DNA. The risk of abnormality in the child depends on the severity of the mother's condition and the extent to which it is left untreated.\n\nPhenylketonuria is a genetic disorder that results in the body's inability to break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. This can lead to a buildup of phenylalanine in the blood, which can cause brain damage and intellectual disabilities in the child if left untreated.\n\nIf the mother's phenylketonuria is mild and has been treated with a low-phenylalanine diet, the risk of abnormality in the child is relatively low, around 1% or less.\n\nHowever, if the mother's phenylketonuria is severe or has not been treated, the risk of abnormality in the child increases significantly. In such cases, the risk of abnormality can be as high as 90% or more.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(B) 10%",
