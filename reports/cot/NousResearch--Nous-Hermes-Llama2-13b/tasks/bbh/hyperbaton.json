            "model_answer": "Option (B) brand-new drinking German enormous motorcycle has the correct adjective order. In English, adjectives typically follow the order of opinion, size, age, shape, and color. In this case, 'brand-new' is an opinion adjective, 'drinking' is a size adjective, 'German' is a origin/material adjective, and 'enormous' is a shape/age adjective. Hence, the correct adjective order is: size - age - origin/material - shape - opinion.",
