            "model_answer": "The answer is B) freeh willy. The reason is that in humorous edits, replacing letters with similar-looking symbols is a common trick. Here, the 'l' is replaced by 'h', which is a letter that looks similar but results in a new and slightly altered name.",

            "model_answer": "(B) pihies is the humorous edit of the artist or movie name 'pixies'. \nThe reason why (B) pihies is a humorous edit is that it changes the 'x' sound into the 'sh' sound, making it sound like 'pissies', which can be perceived as funny or humorous. In contrast, the other options either change the spelling in a way that is not visually humorous or do not change the sound at all.",

            "correct_answer": "(B)",
            "model_answer": "I would say option (B) is the humorous edit as it changes the word 'frog' to 'frig'. While all the options replace letters with other letters, this change creates a humorous pun using the word 'frig' which could be interpreted as a slang term for 'freezing cold' or 'an exclamation of extreme annoyance or dissatisfaction'. Additionally, the original name already has the word 'frog' which is a humorous animal, so changing it to 'frig' makes the edit even funnier.",
