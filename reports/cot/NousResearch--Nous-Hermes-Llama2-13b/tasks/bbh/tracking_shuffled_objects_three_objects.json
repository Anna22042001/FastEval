Claire and Bob swap their gifts. This means that Claire now has the red present and Bob has the white present. \n3. Alice and Claire swap their gifts. This means that Alice now has the white present and Claire has the black ball. \nSince there were three people at the start, and each person started with a different colored present, there must have been one unmentioned swap. This means that there were pairs of people who swapped their gifts twice. Let's try to figure out which pairs these were.\nWe know that Alice, Bob, and Claire each swapped their gifts once. That means that in each of the other two swaps, one person must have swapped their gift with the same person twice. We can eliminate the possibility that Alice, Bob, or Claire swapped their gifts twice, because each of them already has a different colored present at the end of the event. Therefore, one of the other pairs of people must have swapped their gifts twice.\nLet's try to figure out which pair this is. At the start of the event, Alice has a red present, Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a white present. After the first swap, Alice has the black ball, Bob has the red present, and Claire has the white present. \nNow, let's consider the second pair of swaps. We know that one person must have swapped their gift with the same person twice. Since Alice hasn't swapped her gift yet, she must have swapped her gift with the same person twice. This means that Alice's second swap must have been with the same person she swapped with the first time. That means that Alice must have swapped her gift with Bob twice. \nThis means that after the second swap, Alice has the white present, Bob has the black ball, and Claire has the red present. Since Alice has a different colored present than she started with, she must have switched gifts with Claire after the second swap. \nNow we can answer the question.
