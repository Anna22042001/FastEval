Based on the provided information, we are given three objects: a motorcycle, a limousine, and a convertible.\n2. We know that the motorcycle is newer than the limousine. Since the motorcycle is newer, we can assume that it was produced more recently than the limousine. This suggests that the limousine might be older than the motorcycle.\n3. We are also told that the convertible is newer than the motorcycle. Since the motorcycle is newer than the limousine, the convertible must be even newer. This suggests that the limousine might be older than the convertible as well.\n4. Finally, we have the statement that the motorcycle is newer than the limousine. This implies that the motorcycle might be the second-oldest or third-oldest object, while the limousine is the oldest.\n5. If we combine all of these pieces of information, we can conclude that the limousine is the oldest object, followed by the motorcycle and then the convertible. This means that the answer is (B) The limousine is the oldest.\n\nAnswer: (B) The limousine is the oldest.",

In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Mel, Ada, and Ana. Mel finished last. Ana finished second.\nOptions:\n(A) Mel finished last\n(B) Ada finished last\n(C) Ana finished last",
            "correct_answer": "(A)",
            "model_answer": "Let's call our answer choice options A, B, and C.\n\nParagraph 1: \"Mel finished last.\" This tells us that A) Mel finished last, which means they had the highest score in the tournament.\nParagraph 2: \"Ana finished second.\" This tells us that B) Ana finished second, which means they had the second highest score in the tournament. Since Ada is not mentioned, we can assume she finished third.\nParagraph 3: \"There were three golfers: Mel, Ada, and Ana. Ada finished last.\" This is contradictory, as we know from the first paragraph that Mel finished last, not Ada.\n\nAnswer: A) Mel finished last, which means they had the highest score in the tournament, and therefore Ana finished second. C) Ana finished second, while Mel finished with the highest score (A) but since she is second that means Ada finished third with the lowest score (B).",
