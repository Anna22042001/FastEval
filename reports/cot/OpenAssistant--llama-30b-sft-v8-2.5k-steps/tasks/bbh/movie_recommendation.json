The Shawshank Redemption is a drama about a young man who is sent to prison and befriends an older inmate who helps him survive and eventually escape. Dead Man Walking is a drama about a nun who becomes a spiritual advisor to a convicted murderer on death row. There are no obvious similarities in genre or theme between these movies.\n\nNext, let's look at the tone and style of the movies. Terminator 2 Judgment Day is fast-paced and action-packed, with state-of-the-art special effects for its time. The Fugitive is tense and suspenseful, with a lot of chase scenes. The Shawshank Redemption is a slower-paced drama with a focus on character development and relationships. Dead Man Walking deals with serious themes and is also a slower-paced drama. Again, there are no obvious similarities in tone or style between these movies.\n\nOne common thread among these movies is that they are all classics that have received critical acclaim and have a loyal fanbase. They are all well-made, well-acted films that tell compelling stories. Based on this criteria, I would recommend option (E) Braveheart.

Dances with Wolves is about a white man going native, while the other movies are about prison, life in prison and during the second world war, respectively. We can thus eliminate option D, as well as option B. Captain America takes place in a different setting and focuses on a different thematic line, being that of a super-hero in an alternate universe, without any clear parallel in the movies given for comparison.\n\nWe now look at historical accuracy. We discard option C, as Braveheart is set in 14th century Scotland, and depicts the clash between the Scots and the Anglo-Normans, depicting a war which is known to have happened, but depicting it in a rather inaccurate form.\n\nWe now discard option A, B and C, as they are not highly regarded dramas.\n\nWe search for movies with high regarded dramas which do not contain a large portion of documentary style,",

            "model_answer": "My approach to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n1. First, I will compare the options given in the question against each other to see if any pairs might have a higher chance of being similar because they have something in common.\n2. Based on the pairs, I will analyze each of these movies in terms of genre, storyline, characters, themes, and other factors.\n3. From this analysis, I will determine which movie out of the options listed is most similar to Beauty and the Beast, Independence Day, Forrest Gump, and Jurassic Park.\n\nReasoning: If we compare pairwise between the options given, we can see that option (B) \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and option (C) \"Extreme Measures\" share the genres of horror, psychological thriller, and drama, while option (A) \"The Bag Man\" is a mystery/thriller/crime drama. Option (D) \"Kicking Off\" is a football comedy drama.\n\nBased on this comparison, we can eliminate option (A) as it is not similar to the genres of the other movies in the list.\n\nNow, if we analyze each movie in terms of their plot, characters, and themes, we can see that option (B) \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and option (C) \"Extreme Measures\" both have psychological themes and explore the darker aspects of the human psyche. While this does not connect them to the other movies in the list, it also does not disqualify them entirely as they do share some thematic similarities.\n\nOption (D) \"Kicking Off\" is a football comedy drama and does not share any obvious similarities with the other movies in the list. So, it can also be eliminated.",
