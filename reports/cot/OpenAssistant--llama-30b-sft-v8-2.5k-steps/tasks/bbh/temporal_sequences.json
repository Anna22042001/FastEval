Therefore Leslie could not have gone to the clothing store before 5am.\nStep 2: We know that Richard saw Leslie buying a phone at the electronics store from 5am to 7am. Therefore Leslie could not have gone to the clothing store between 5am and 7am.\nStep 3: We know that Jason saw Leslie waiting at the airport from 11am to 6pm. Therefore Leslie could have gone to the clothing store between 11am and 6pm.\nStep 4: We know that David saw Leslie attending class at the school from 6pm to 10pm. Therefore Leslie could not have gone to the clothing store between 6pm and 10pm.\nStep 5: We know that the clothing store was closed after 10pm. Therefore Leslie could not have gone to the clothing store after 10pm.\nStep 6: Putting it all together, we can eliminate options A, B, and C as possible times Leslie could have gone to the clothing store, which leaves us with the answer:\n(D) 6pm to 10pm",

Option (D) says Jessica went to the beach between 5am and 8am, which is outside the timeframe because the beach was closed after 10pm.\n\nSecond, we eliminate options with times when Jessica was not at the beach. Options (B) and (C) say that Jessica went to the beach between 12pm to 3pm and 9am to 12pm respectively. However, there are witnesses who saw Jessica doing other activities during those times: Thomas saw her taking photos near the Eiffel Tower from 8am to 9am, and Richard saw her fixing the computer at the electronic store from 12pm to 3pm. Therefore, we can eliminate options (B) and (C).\n\nThird, we are left with option (A) that says Jessica went to the beach between 8am to 9am. During that time, Emily saw Jessica stretching at a yoga studio from 5am to 8am, and there is no indication that Jessica left the yoga studio to go to the beach and then returned to the yoga studio before Emily saw her. Therefore, we can also eliminate option (A).\n\nFinally, there is no option left that states the time Jessica went to the beach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(E) 5am to 8am and 7pm to 10pm.",
