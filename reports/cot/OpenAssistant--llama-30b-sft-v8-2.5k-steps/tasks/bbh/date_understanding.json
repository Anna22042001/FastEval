In my timezone, the time zone of New York, January 2nd, 1958 was a Thursday. I can then use this information to determine the day of the week for January 9th, 1958 by adding 7 days and adjusting for the different month (January). If January has 31 days, then January 9th would be a Friday. However, leap years are skipped and January ends on the 31st, so January 9th, 1958 would be a Saturday.\n3. With a baseline now established, I can add an additional 5 years and shift into a different month (January or February?) and day of the week (Monday, February 9, 1962).\n4. Then I add an additional 7 days to reach a date one week from February 9th, 1962.

This is in the format of day, hour (24-hour clock), and minute in the month/day/year order, respectively.\n* To convert this time to a date, we can assume that the time component is unnecessary and use only the date portion in the format of month/day/year.\n* So, the date one year ago from today would be 05/04/2003.",
