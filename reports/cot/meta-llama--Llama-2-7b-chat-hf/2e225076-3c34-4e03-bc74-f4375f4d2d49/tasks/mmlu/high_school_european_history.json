The passage states that the matter of life \"breaks up\" when it is exposed to the continual death that is the condition of its manifesting vitality, and that it breaks down into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which are ordinary matter. This suggests that Huxley believed that life is a property of certain physical matter and does not have any inherent properties of its own.\nTherefore, the answer is (C) merely a property of a certain kind of matter.",

            "model_answer": "Of course, I'm here to help! I understand that you want me to answer the question step-by-step, explaining my reasoning clearly before providing the final answer.\nTo begin with, let's analyze the quotation provided by Edward Gibbon:\n\"The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful.\"\nThis quote suggests that there was a lack of consistency and standardization in religious worship in ancient Rome, with different groups having their own beliefs and practices.\nNow, let's evaluate each of the possible answers:\n(A) In ancient Rome, religious worship was decentralized and tended to vary with one's social position.\nWhile it is true that religious beliefs and practices varied among different social groups in ancient Rome, the quote provided by Gibbon suggests that this was not limited to one particular social class or group. Rather, it was a societal-wide phenomenon, with different modes of worship being considered true by the people, false by the philosopher, and useful by the magistrate. Therefore, this answer is not the best fit for the quote.\n(B) In ancient Rome, religious worship was the source of much social tension and turmoil.\nThe quote does mention that religious worship was considered true by the people, false by the philosopher, and useful by the magistrate, but it does not specifically highlight any social tension or turmoil resulting from these diverse beliefs and practices. While it is possible that there may have been some conflict or disagreement between different religious groups in ancient Rome, the quote does not provide any evidence to support this answer.\n(C) In ancient Rome, religious worship was homogeneous and highly centralized.\nThis answer is contradictory to the quote provided by Gibbon, which suggests that there were many different modes of worship in ancient Rome, with no indication of a single, unified religion. While it is possible that there may have been some centralized religious authority in ancient Rome, the quote does not provide any evidence to support this answer.\n(D) In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.\nThis answer is the most likely conclusion based on the quote provided by Gibbon. The quote suggests that different modes of worship were considered true by the people, false by the philosopher, and useful by the magistrate, but it does not provide any information about the impact of religious worship on the society as a whole. However, the quote does mention that religious worship was considered useful by the magistrate, which could potentially imply that Christianity, as a new and influential religion, may have had an impact on the religious landscape in ancient Rome.\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the quote provided, the best answer is (D) In ancient Rome, religious worship was revolutionized by the introduction of Christianity.",

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure. If asked to bestow a favor on such persons he would reply haughtily: \"I do not know him\"; of such as rarely presented themselves he would say, \"He is a man I never see\"; and from these judgments there was no appeal.\nNo one understood better than Louis XIV the art of enhancing the value of a favor by his manner of bestowing it; he knew how to make the most of a word, a smile, even of a glance.\nHe loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court; to spend money freely on equipages and buildings, on feasting and at cards, was a sure way to gain his favor, perhaps to obtain the honor of a word from him. Motives of policy had something to do with this; by making expensive habits the fashion, and, for people in a certain position, a necessity, he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, and gradually reduced them to depend on his bounty for the means of subsistence.\n\u2014Duke Saint-Simon, Memoirs of Louis XIV and His Court and His Regency, c. 1750\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of the bias found in the document above?\n\n(A) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is sympathetic to King Louis.\n(B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.\n(C) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported the extension of the administrative, financial, military, and religious control of the central state over the French population.\n(D) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, supported King Louis's preservation of the aristocracy's social position and legal privileges, while he removed their power.",

The duke also mentions that the king loved splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things and encouraged similar tastes in his Court. These statements suggest that the king had a bias towards the wealthy and powerful members of society, which could be seen as a form of suppression against those who were not part of the nobility.\nThe other options do not accurately reflect the bias expressed in the memoir. Option (A) is unlikely, as the duke is not necessarily a member of the king's inner circle or a close friend. Option (C) is also unlikely, as the duke does not seem to support the extension of state control over the population. Option (D) is possible, but it is not the primary focus of the passage, which is the king'ssuppression of the nobility.\nIn conclusion, the best explanation of the bias found in the document is (B) The duke, as a member of the French nobility, is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.",

We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive.
