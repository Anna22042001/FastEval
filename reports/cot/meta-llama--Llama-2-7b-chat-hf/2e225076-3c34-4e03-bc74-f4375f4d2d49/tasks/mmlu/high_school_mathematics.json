I understand that you want me to provide a safe and respectful answer to your question.\nTo determine the probability that $x < y$, we need to analyze the given rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$.\nStep 1: Identify the possible values of $x$ and $y$ within the rectangle.\nThe rectangle has a total area of $6 \\times 4 = 24$ square units. Since $x$ and $y$ are random variables, they can take on any value within the rectangle.\nStep 2: Count the number of pairs of values $(x,y)$ such that $x < y$.\nWe need to count the number of pairs of values that satisfy the condition $x < y$. Let's consider each vertex of the rectangle separately:\n* Vertex $(0,0)$: There is only one pair of values $(0,0)$ that satisfy the condition $x < y$.\n* Vertex $(3,0)$: There are two pairs of values $(3,0)$ and $(3,1)$ that satisfy the condition $x < y$.\n* Vertex $(3,2)$: There are two pairs of values $(3,2)$ and $(3,3)$ that satisfy the condition $x < y$.\n* Vertex $(0,2)$: There is only one pair of values $(0,2)$ that satisfies the condition $x < y$.\nIn total, there are $4$ pairs of values that satisfy the condition $x < y$.\nStep 3: Calculate the probability that $x < y$.\nThe probability of any event is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. In this case, the total number of outcomes is $24$, which is the total area of the rectangle.\nSo, the probability that $x < y$ is:\n$$\\frac{4}{24} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nTherefore, the answer is (B) $\\frac{1}{6}$.",

This means that she has rotated 2250 degrees around her original axis, which is perpendicular to the direction she was facing.\nTo find the direction she is facing when she finishes the spin, we need to use the right-hand rule. The right-hand rule states that if you curl your right hand in the direction of the spin, your thumb will point in the direction the skater is facing after the spin is complete.\nIn this case, the skater spun 2250 degrees to her right.
