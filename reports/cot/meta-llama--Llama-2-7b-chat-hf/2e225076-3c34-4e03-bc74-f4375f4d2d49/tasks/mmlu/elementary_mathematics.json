I understand that you would like me to provide a safe and respectful answer to the question.\nTo solve for p in the equation 24 = 2p, we need to isolate the variable p. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.\n24 = 2p\n\u00f7 2\n= p\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of p:\n\nIf p = 4, then 24 = 8p, which is not true.\nIf p = 8, then 24 = 16p, which is also not true.\nIf p = 12, then 24 = 24p, which is true.\nTherefore, the value of p that makes the equation true is (D) p = 12.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is (D) p = 12.",
