Therefore, we can eliminate (A) as a possible set of common divisors.\nMoving on to set (B):\n* -6 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* -2 is a divisor of x but not y.\n* -1 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 0 is not a divisor of either x or y.\n* 1 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 2 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 6 is a divisor of both x and y.\n\nSimilar to set (A), we can see that set (B) does not include all possible common divisors of two integers, because 0 is not a divisor of either x or y. Therefore, we can eliminate (B) as a possible set of common divisors.\nNow, let's analyze set (C):\n* -6 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* -3 is a divisor of x but not y.\n* -2 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* -1 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 1 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 2 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 3 is a divisor of x but not y.\n* 6 is a divisor of both x and y.\n\nBased on this analysis, set (C) includes all possible common divisors of two integers, because every integer in the set is a divisor of both x and y. Therefore, set (C) is a possible set of common divisors.\nFinally, let's analyze set (D):\n* -6 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* -3 is a divisor of x but not y.\n* -2 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* -1 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 1 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 2 is a divisor of both x and y.\n* 3 is a divisor of x but not y.\n* 6 is a divisor of both x and y.\n\nUnfortunately, set (D) does not meet the definition of a common divisor, because 3 is a divisor of x but not y.

Let's break it down step by step:\nThe question asks about the time required for a single file-read operation in a system with two different versions:\n Version 1: In this version, the file read retrieves blocks of 1,000 bytes.\n Version 2: In this version, the file read retrieves blocks of 4,000 bytes.\nThe question then asks for the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1.\nTo answer this question, we need to calculate the time required for each version separately and then compare them. So, let's start by breaking down the time required for each version:\nVersion 1:\n1. Disk seek time: 25 msec\n2. Disk latency time: 8 msec\n3. Disk transfer time: 1 msec per 1,000 bytes\n4.

Operating system overhead: same as version 1 (1 msec per 1,000 bytes + 10 msec)\nTotal time for version 2: 36 msec (25 + 8 + 1 + 10)\nNow that we have the time required for each version, we can calculate the ratio of the time required to read a large file under version 2 to the time required to read the same large file under version 1:\nRatio = (Time required for version 2) / (Time required for version 1)\n= (36 msec) / (36 msec)\n= 1:1\n\nSince the time required for both versions is the same, the ratio is 1:1, or (A).

I'm here to help you in a safe and positive manner.\nTo answer your question, we need to first understand what a purely segmented memory system is. A purely segmented memory system is a type of memory management system that divides memory into equal-sized units or segments. Each segment can be Mars directly into the physical memory, and the operating system can manipulate the segments independently.\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n(I) It divides memory into units of equal size: This statement is correct. A purely segmented memory system divides memory into equal-sized units or segments, which can be allocated and deallocated independently.\n(II) It permits implementation of virtual memory: This statement is incorrect. A purely segmented memory system does not permit implementation of virtual memory. Virtual memory is a technique used in some operating systems to enable the use of more memory than is physically available by temporarily transferring less-used pages of memory to secondary storage. A purely segmented memory system does not have this ability.\n(III) It suffers from internal fragmentation: This statement is correct. Internal fragmentation occurs when there are unevenly sized holes or gaps in the memory, which can lead to inefficiencies in memory usage. A purely segmented memory system can suffer from internal fragmentation due to the fixed size of the memory segments.\nBased on the above evaluation, the correct answer is (D) I and III.\nI hope this helps!
