(This is because the identity of a group consists of all the elements of the group, and an element of order 15 is certainly one of those elements.)\n* Now, if the group has n elements in total, then the number of elements of order 15 is at least 8, because 8 is the minimum number of elements needed to produce all the elements of the group of order 15 using the identity element.

            "model_answer": "Your question is quite technical, and I'll do my best to explain each step of the reasoning process. Please sit tight, and I'll be happy to help.\nTo begin with, let's understand what homomorphic images and factor groups are. A homomorphic image of a group G is a group H that is constructed by applying a group homomorphism (a function between groups) to G. In simpler terms, if we have a group G and a function f: G \u2192 H, we can form the group H by mapping each element g in G to the corresponding element f(g) in H.\nNow, let's consider Statement 1: \"Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G.\"\nTo determine whether this statement is true or false, we need to evidence. We can prove this statement by showing that every homomorphic image of a group G is either isomorphic to G or is a factor group of G.\nHere's how we can prove it:\n1. Suppose G is a group, and H is a homomorphic image of G.\n2. Since H is a homomorphic image of G, there exists a group homomorphism f: G \u2192 H.\n3. By the definition of a homomorphic image, we know that f(g) = g for all g in G.\n4. Now, consider the group homomorphism f^2: G \u2192 G, where f^2(g) = f(f(g)).\n5. By the definition of a homomorphic image, we know that f^2 is also a group homomorphism.\n6. Suppose f^2(g) = g' for some g' in G. Then, we have f(g') = f(g), so g' = g. Hence, f^2 is an isomorphism between G and a factor group of G.\n7. Since f^2 is an isomorphism, we can conclude that every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to either G or a factor group of G.\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nNow, let's consider Statement 2: \"The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.\"\nTo determine whether this statement is True or False, we need to provide evidence. We can prove this statement by showing that every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to at most one factor group of G.\nHere's how we can prove it:\n1. Suppose G is a group, and H is a homomorphic image of G.\n2. By Statement 1, H is isomorphic to either G or a factor group of G.\n3. Suppose H is isomorphic to a factor group K of G. Then, there exists a group homomorphism f: G \u2192 K such that f(g) = g for all g in G.\n4. Since f is a group homomorphism, we know that f^2(g) = f(f(g)) = g for all g in G.\n5. Therefore, K is a factor group of G, and f is an isomorphism between G and K.\n6. Hence, every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to at most one factor group of G.\nTherefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\nFinally, the answer to your question is (D) False, True. Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is True, so the two statements are consistent. Therefore, the answer is (D) False, True.",
