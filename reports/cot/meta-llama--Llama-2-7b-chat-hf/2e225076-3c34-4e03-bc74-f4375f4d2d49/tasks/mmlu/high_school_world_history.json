By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\n\n(A) How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other\n(B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era\n(C) Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.\n(D) How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion",

The passage explains how early cannons proved useful in Western Europe during the 1200s to 1400s, despite their slow firing speed and weight, due to the prolonged sieges that dominated warfare in the region. In contrast, China focused on improving horse archer units to combat its mobile steppe nomadic enemies, rather than investing in early gunpowder weapons. This historical difference in military strategies between Europe and China is the central argument in the passage.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",

He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away.

The Russian troops were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there, and the nearest American troops were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. This meant that the United States was unable to stop the Russians from seizing all of Korea.\nStep 2: Analyzing the options\nBonesteel's main goal was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept, while preventing them from seizing all of Korea. He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\nStep 3: Identifying the impact on Koreans\nThe events depicted here had a significant impact on Koreans. The use of the 38th parallel as a divide created two zones within Korea, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south. This division of Korea had a profound effect on the lives of Koreans, leading to a long and complex history of separation and tension between the two nations.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",

The question asks which of the following adjectives best describes the differing views about the French Revolution expressed by Dickens and Wordsworth.\nAfter carefully reading the passage, I will explain my reasoning step-by-step before providing the answer.\nAdjective (A) Optimistic, encouraged:\nThe passage does not mention any optimistic or encouraging views about the French Revolution. In fact, both authors seem to have a rather pessimistic outlook on the event. Dickens describes it as \"the worst of times,\" while Wordsworth sees it as a period of \"darkness.\" Neither author expresses any hope or encouragement about the French Revolution. Therefore, option (A) Optimistic, encouraged does not accurately describe the views of Dickens and Wordsworth.\nAdjective (B) Understanding, accepting:\nWhile both authors have different opinions about the French Revolution, they do not seem to be understanding or accepting of it. Dickens's description of the event as \"the worst of times\" and Wordsworth's reference to it as \"the season of Darkness\" neither convey a sense of acceptance nor understanding. Instead, they seem to be highlighting the negative aspects of the French Revolution. Therefore, option (B) Understanding, accepting is not the best description of the views expressed by Dickens and Wordsworth.\nAdjective (C) Cynical, enthusiastic:\nWhile both authors have differing views about the French Revolution, neither of them seem to be overly enthusiastic about it. Dickens describes the event as \"the worst of times,\" while Wordsworth sees it as a period of \"darkness.\" These descriptions do not convey a sense of cynicism or enthusiasm. Instead, they seem to be objective and neutral. Therefore, option (C) Cynical, enthusiastic does not accurately describe the views of Dickens and Wordsworth.\nAdjective (D) Sincere, resigned:\nBased on the passage, both authors seem to be sincere in their descriptions of the French Revolution. They do not appear to be resigned or apathetic about the event, but rather express their opinions in a straightforward manner. Dickens describes it as \"the worst of times,\" while Wordsworth sees it as a period of \"darkness.\" These descriptions convey a sense of sincerity and honesty, rather than resignation. Therefore, option (D) Sincere, resigned is the best description of the views expressed by Dickens and Wordsworth.\nIn conclusion, the answer to the question is (D) Sincere, resigned. Both authors express their differing views about the French Revolution in a straightforward and sincere manner, without any sense of resignation or apathy.",

There are several options provided, and I will explain why each one is incorrect before providing the correct answer.\nOption (A) is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs. While trade with Europeans did occur during this period, it was primarily focused on exchanging goods such as gold, ivory, and spices for European goods such as textiles, metal tools, and firearms.\nOption (B) is also incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms. While firearms were introduced to Sub-Saharan Africa during this period, they were primarily obtained through trade with European powers and were used for military purposes, such as defending against external threats or expanding territory.\nOption (C) is partially correct, as Sub-Saharan Africans did depend on European merchants as the sole purchasers of slaves. However, this is not the full story, as the transatlantic slave trade was a complex network of markets and trading systems that involved multiple actors and interests.\nOption (D) is not relevant to the question and does not accurately reflect the historical context.

Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.
