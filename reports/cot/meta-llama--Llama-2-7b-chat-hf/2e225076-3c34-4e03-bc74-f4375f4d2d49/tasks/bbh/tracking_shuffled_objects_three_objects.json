This way, Claire can use her speed and agility to attack the right side of the field, while Alice can use her defensive skills to support the midfielder.\nStep 2: Bob and Claire trade positions.\nReasoning: Since Bob is playing goalkeeper and Claire is playing left winger, it doesn't make sense for them to trade positions. Goalkeepers are responsible for protecting the goal, while wingers are responsible for attacking the opponent's goal. So, it's better for Bob to stay in his position as goalkeeper.\nStep 3: Alice and Claire trade positions.\nReasoning: Since Alice is playing right midfielder and Claire is playing left winger, it makes sense for them to trade positions again. This way, Alice can use her defensive skills to support the left side of the field, while Claire can use her speed and agility to attack the right side of the field.\nNow, based on the information provided, the final answer is:\n(C) left winger",
