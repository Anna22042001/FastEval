However, since the date format is MM/DD/YYYY, we need to convert the current date to the correct format first.\nUsing the current date in MM/DD/YYYY format, which is 02/27/2020, we can calculate the date 10 days ago as follows:\n02/27/2020 - 10 = 03/17/2020\nSo, the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY format is 03/17/2020.\nStep 3: Output the answer\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) 01/23/2020.",
