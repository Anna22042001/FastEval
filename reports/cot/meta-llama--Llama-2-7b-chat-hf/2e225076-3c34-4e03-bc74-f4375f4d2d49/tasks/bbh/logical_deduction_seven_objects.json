The peaches are the second-cheapest.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n(A) The kiwis are the fourth-most expensive: This is incorrect because, according to the paragraph, the kiwis are the second-most expensive fruit. Therefore, they cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n(B) The plums are the fourth-most expensive: This is also incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the pears are more expensive than the plums. Therefore, the plums cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n(C) The mangoes are the fourth-most expensive: This is incorrect because, according to the paragraph, the mangoes are the third-most expensive fruit. Therefore, they cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n(D) The watermelons are the fourth-most expensive: This is incorrect because, according to the paragraph, the watermelons are not among the seven fruits sold at the fruit stand. Therefore, they cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n(E) The pears are the fourth-most expensive: This is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the pears are the third-cheapest fruit. Therefore, they cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n(F) The peaches are the fourth-most expensive: This is incorrect because, according to the paragraph, the peaches are the second-cheapest fruit. Therefore, they cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n(G) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive: This is incorrect because, according to the paragraph, the oranges are less expensive than the kiwis. Therefore, they cannot be the fourth-most expensive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (None of the above). The seventh fruit, the one that is the fourth-most expensive, is not among the options provided in the question.",
