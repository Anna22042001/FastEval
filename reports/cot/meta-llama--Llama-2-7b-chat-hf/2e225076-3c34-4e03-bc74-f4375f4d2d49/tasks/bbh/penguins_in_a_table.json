We now add a penguin to the table:\nJames, 12, 90, 12\nWhat is the cumulated age of the penguins?\nOptions:\n(A) 24\n(B) 29\n(C) 36\n(D) 41\n(E) 48",

            "model_answer": "Of course, I'm happy to help! I understand that you want me to answer the question step-by-step, so I will explain my reasoning before providing the final answer.\nStep 1: Let's start by listing the penguins in the table:\nLouis (7, 50, 11)\nBernard (5, 80, 13)\nVincent (9, 60, 11)\nGwen (8, 70, 15)\nJames (12, 90, 12)\n\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the cumulated age of the penguins. To do this, we will add the ages of each penguin together.\nLouis' age is 7 + Bernard's age is 5 = 12\nVincent's age is 9 + Gwen's age is 8 = 17\nJames' age is 12 +\n\nStep 3: So, the cumulated age of the penguins is 12 + 17 + 12 = 41.\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 41.\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

I understand that you want me to answer the question step-by-step, so I will explain my reasoning before providing the answer.\nTo determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the ages of each penguin in the table. Let's go through the penguins one by one:\n1. Louis - age 7\n2. Bernard - age 5\n3. Vincent - age 9\n4. Gwen - age 8\n\nBased on the ages provided, we can see that only Louis and Vincent are more than 5 years old. Louis is 7 years old, and Vincent is 9 years old. Therefore, the answer is (B) 2.\nSo, there are 2 penguins more than 5 years old in the table.",
