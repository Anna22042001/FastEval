(This is the only statement that mentions the position of the birds relative to each other.)\n3. The robin is to the left of the blue jay. (This statement tells us that the robin is located next to the blue jay, but doesn't give us any information about the position of the crow.)\nNow, let's consider the options:\n(A) The robin is the rightmost.\nThis option implies that the robin is located on the right side of the branch, which is not necessarily true based on the information provided. The paragraph only tells us that the robin is to the right of the crow, but doesn't give us any information about its position relative to the other birds. Therefore, we cannot say that the robin is the rightmost bird with certainty.\n(B) The blue jay is the rightmost.\nSimilarly, this option doesn't make sense based on the information provided. While it's true that the blue jay is mentioned as being on the branch, we have no way of knowing its position relative to the other birds without additional information.\n(C) The crow is the rightmost.\nThis option is also not supported by the information provided.

Here's how I'll approach this:\nStep 1: Understanding the question\nThe question states that there are three objects arranged in a fixed order on a shelf. The objects are described as books, and their colors are provided as black, orange, and blue. The question also mentions that the blue book is to the right of the orange book, and the orange book is to the right of the black book.\nStep 2: Identifying the relationships between the objects\nFrom the information provided, we can see that there is a relationship between the objects in terms of their positioning on the shelf. The blue book is located to the right of the orange book, and the orange book is located to the right of the black book.\nStep 3: Eliminating impossible options\nBased on the information provided, we can eliminate option (D) The black book is the second from the left, as it doesn't align with the other objects in the sequence.\nStep 4: Identifying the correct answer\nLooking at the remaining options, we can see that option (B) The orange book is the second from the left aligns with the information provided. The orange book is located to the right of the black book, and the blue book is located to the right of the orange book. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The orange book is the second from the left.\nNow, I will output the answer in a single letter with parentheses without anything else: (B)",
