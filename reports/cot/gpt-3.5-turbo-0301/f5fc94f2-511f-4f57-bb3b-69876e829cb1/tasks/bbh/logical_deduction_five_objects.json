Since Eve finished first, Rob must have finished second or third. \n\nFrom statement 3, we know that Joe finished above Eli. From statement 4, we know that Joe finished below Mya. Therefore, Mya must have finished second or third. If Mya finished second, then Joe would have finished last, which contradicts statement 3.
