            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (B). \n\nHourdequin argues that individualism leads us into two problems: (1) \"tragedy of the commons\" situations, where individuals act in their own self-interest and deplete shared resources, and (2) an atomistic view of persons, where we see ourselves as separate individuals rather than interconnected members of a community. Therefore, the correct answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what the killing/letting die distinction is. This distinction refers to the difference between actively killing someone and simply allowing them to die. \n\nNext, we need to understand Philippa Foot's argument. She argues that there is a moral difference between killing and letting die because of the concept of \"intention.\" When someone actively kills another person, their intention is to cause harm. However, when someone simply allows another person to die, their intention is not to cause harm, but rather to refrain from interfering with the natural course of events. \n\nNow, we can consider the answer choices. Option (A) suggests that the moral relevance of the killing/letting die distinction is based on rights of noninterference. This aligns with Foot's argument, as she emphasizes the importance of refraining from interfering with the natural course of events. Option (B) suggests that the moral relevance is based on rights to goods and services, which is not related to Foot's argument. Option (C) suggests that both options (A) and (B) are correct, but we have already determined that option (B) is not relevant to Foot's argument. Option (D) suggests that neither option is correct, but we have already determined that option (A) is relevant to Foot's argument. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

However, Papadaki is arguing against Kant's view of sexual objectification, which means that Papadaki does not hold a positive view of sexual objectification. Therefore, option (C) can also be eliminated.\n\nThis leaves us with option (A), which suggests that Papadaki disagrees with Kant's view because it is not clear how sexual use sacrifices humanity. This is a plausible reason for disagreeing with Kant's view, as it suggests that Kant's argument is not well-supported or well-reasoned. Therefore, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what Sandel's case against moral engineering is. Sandel argues that attempts to enhance human traits through genetic engineering or other means are problematic because they undermine the idea of human dignity and the value of human life. He believes that such interventions would lead to a society where people are valued based on their genetic makeup rather than their inherent worth as human beings.\n\nNext, we can consider each of the options provided. \n\n(A) A Kantian approach would focus on the idea of treating people as ends in themselves, rather than as means to an end. While Sandel's argument does touch on this idea, it is not the central focus of his critique of moral engineering. \n\n(B) The ethics of prima facie duty is a theory that emphasizes the importance of considering multiple moral obligations and weighing them against each other. While Sandel's argument does involve weighing the value of human dignity against the potential benefits of genetic engineering, this theory does not fully capture the complexity of his argument. \n\n(C) Virtue ethics is a theory that emphasizes the importance of developing virtuous character traits in order to live a good life. While Sandel's argument does touch on the idea of what it means to be a good human being, this theory does not fully capture the complexity of his argument. \n\n(D) Natural law theory is a theory that emphasizes the importance of following natural laws in order to live a good life. While Sandel's argument does touch on the idea of natural laws, it is not the central focus of his critique of moral engineering. \n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is (B) an application of the ethics of prima facie duty.",
