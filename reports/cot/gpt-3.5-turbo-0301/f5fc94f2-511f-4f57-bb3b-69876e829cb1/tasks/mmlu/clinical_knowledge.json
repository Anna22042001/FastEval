            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "During the cardiac cycle, the left ventricle contracts and then relaxes. During the relaxation phase, the pressure in the left ventricle decreases, causing the aortic valve to close. However, blood continues to flow through the vessels because the arteries have elastic recoil, which helps to maintain the pressure gradient and keep the blood flowing. Therefore, the correct answer is (D).",

Option (A) states that it is a cause of ophthalmoplegia, which is the paralysis or weakness of the eye muscles. Option (B) states that it causes a large multi-nodular goitre, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland with multiple nodules. Option (C) states that it is commoner in males than females. Option (D) states that in the past, Graves Disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck', which is a term used to describe the swelling of the neck due to an enlarged thyroid gland.\n\nStep 2: Eliminate options that are clearly false. Option (C) can be eliminated as Graves Disease is actually more common in females than males.\n\nStep 3: Consider the remaining options. Option (A) is true as ophthalmoplegia is a common symptom of Graves Disease. Option (B) is not necessarily true as Graves Disease can cause a diffuse goitre, but not necessarily a multi-nodular one. Option (D) is also true as 'Derbyshire Neck' was a common manifestation of Graves Disease in the past.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer. The answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Muscle contraction occurs when myosin heads bind to actin filaments, causing them to slide past each other. This process requires ATP and is controlled by nerve impulses. When a nerve impulse reaches the muscle fibre, it triggers the release of calcium ions, which bind to the regulatory protein troponin, causing it to change shape and move tropomyosin away from the actin binding sites. This allows the myosin heads to bind to the actin filaments and initiate muscle contraction.\n\nTo relax a muscle fibre, the nerve stimulus must be removed so that calcium ions are no longer released. Without calcium ions, troponin returns to its original shape and tropomyosin covers the actin binding sites, preventing myosin heads from binding to actin filaments. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.",

            "model_answer": "Fatigue is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple neurotransmitters in the brain. However, research has shown that alterations in certain neurotransmitters by pharmacological agents can influence fatigue development. \n\nAcetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in many functions in the brain, including attention, learning, and memory. Noradrenaline is another neurotransmitter that is involved in arousal and attention. Both of these neurotransmitters have been implicated in fatigue, with decreased levels of acetylcholine and noradrenaline being associated with increased fatigue.\n\nDopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in reward and motivation, as well as movement and coordination. Acetylcholine has already been mentioned as a neurotransmitter involved in fatigue, but it is also involved in movement and coordination. Therefore, alterations in both dopamine and acetylcholine could potentially influence fatigue development.\n\nGlutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in many functions, including learning and memory. Serotonin is another neurotransmitter that is involved in mood regulation and sleep. While both of these neurotransmitters have been implicated in fatigue, there is less research on their specific roles in fatigue development compared to acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and dopamine.\n\nBased on the available research, the answer to the question is (A) Acetyl choline and noradrenaline.",

It is characterized by stiffness (spasticity) and weakness in the leg muscles, making it difficult to walk and maintain balance. \n\nStep 2: Evaluate each option. \n\n(A) Multiple Sclerosis can cause this neurological pattern - This statement is not entirely true. While both conditions can cause spasticity and weakness in the legs, spastic paraplegia is a distinct condition that is not caused by multiple sclerosis. \n\n(B) Proprioceptive loss is a common feature - Proprioception refers to the ability to sense the position and movement of one's body. In spastic paraplegia, proprioceptive loss is not a common feature. \n\n(C) Coordination in the legs is affected - Coordination refers to the ability to move the legs in a smooth and controlled manner. In spastic paraplegia, coordination is often affected due to the stiffness and weakness in the leg muscles. \n\n(D) The tone is normal or flaccid - This statement is not true.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "During exercise, the body needs energy to fuel the muscles. One way to provide this energy is by breaking down glycogen, a stored form of glucose in the muscles and liver. \n\nInsulin is a hormone that promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen and inhibits glycogen breakdown. Therefore, it is unlikely that insulin would activate glycogen breakdown during exercise. \n\nCortisol is a hormone that is released in response to stress and can increase blood glucose levels by promoting glycogen breakdown in the liver. While cortisol may play a role in glycogen breakdown during exercise, it is not the primary activator. \n\nIncreased pH, or alkalosis, can actually inhibit glycogen breakdown by decreasing the activity of enzymes involved in the process. Therefore, it is not a likely activator of glycogen breakdown during exercise. \n\nThe most likely activator of glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is the hormone epinephrine, which is released in response to physical activity and can stimulate glycogen breakdown to provide energy for the muscles. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) none of the above.",
