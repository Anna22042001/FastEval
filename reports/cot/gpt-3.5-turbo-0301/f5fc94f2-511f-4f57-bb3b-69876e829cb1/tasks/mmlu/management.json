Planning involves setting goals, developing strategies, and creating action plans to achieve those goals. Therefore, key management skills in planning would include:\n\n1. Conceptual skills: the ability to think creatively and abstractly, to see the big picture, and to understand how different parts of the organization fit together.\n\n2. Analytical skills: the ability to analyze data, identify trends, and make informed decisions based on that analysis.\n\n3. IT and computing skills: the ability to use technology to gather and analyze data, communicate with team members, and manage projects.\n\n4. Communication skills: the ability to communicate effectively with team members, stakeholders, and customers, both verbally and in writing.\n\nBased on this, we can eliminate options (A), (B), and (D) as all of these are key management skills required for planning. Option (C), IT and computing skills, may be important for planning in some organizations, but it is not a key management skill required for planning in general. Therefore, the answer is (C).",
