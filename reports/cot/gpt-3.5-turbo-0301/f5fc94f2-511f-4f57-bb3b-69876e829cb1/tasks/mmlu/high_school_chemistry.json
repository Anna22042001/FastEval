            "model_answer": "1. Find the mass of oxygen in the compound by subtracting the mass of carbon and hydrogen from the total mass: 29.05 g - 18.02 g - 3.03 g = 7.00 g\n2. Convert the mass of each element to moles by dividing by their respective atomic masses: \n- Moles of carbon = 18.02 g / 12.01 g/mol = 1.50 mol\n- Moles of hydrogen = 3.03 g / 1.01 g/mol = 3.00 mol\n- Moles of oxygen = 7.00 g / 16.00 g/mol = 0.44 mol\n3. Divide each mole value by the smallest mole value to get the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms: \n- Carbon: 1.50 mol / 0.44 mol = 3.41 \u2248 3\n- Hydrogen: 3.00 mol / 0.44 mol = 6.82 \u2248 7\n- Oxygen: 0.44 mol / 0.44 mol = 1\n4.
