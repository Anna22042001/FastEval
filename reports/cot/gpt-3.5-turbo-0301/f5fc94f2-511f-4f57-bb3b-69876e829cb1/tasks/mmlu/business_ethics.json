            "model_answer": "The first blank refers to a type of regulation that goes beyond the interactions that CSOs (civil society organizations) have with businesses. This suggests that the regulation is broader in scope and likely involves some form of oversight or control. \n\nOption A, legal regulation, could fit this description as it often involves setting rules and guidelines for businesses to follow. However, the third blank refers to \"processes,\" which is a more general term than \"mechanics.\" Therefore, option A is not the best choice.\n\nOption B, civil regulation, does not make much sense as \"civil\" is not typically used to describe regulation. Additionally, \"outcomes\" in the third blank does not fit well with this option.\n\nOption C, political regulation, is a strong possibility as it suggests that the regulation is driven by government or other political entities. The third blank, \"outcomes,\" also fits well with this option as political regulation often aims to achieve certain outcomes or goals.\n\nOption D, environmental regulation, is unlikely as it is too specific and does not fit with the broader scope suggested by the first blank. Additionally, \"mechanics\" in the third blank does not fit well with this option.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C) Political, Interactions, Outcomes.",
