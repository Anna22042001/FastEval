The variables given are:\n- Number of checks received: 100\n- Average donation: $155\n- Standard deviation: $32\n\nStep 2: Determine the appropriate statistical test\nSince we are dealing with a sample and want to make an inference about the population, we need to use a confidence interval. Specifically, we can use a t-test since the sample size is less than 30.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the confidence interval\nUsing a t-distribution with 99 degrees of freedom (100 - 1), we can calculate the 95% confidence interval as:\n$155 \u00b1 t(0.025, 99) x $32 / sqrt(100)\n$155 \u00b1 2.626 x $3.2\n$155 \u00b1 $8.4\nLower bound: $146.6\nUpper bound: $163.4\n\nStep 4: Interpret the results\nWe can say with 95% confidence that the true average donation in November is between about $146.6 and $163.4.\n\nStep 5: Choose the most appropriate statement\nThe most appropriate statement is (C): We are 95% confident that the average donation in November is between about $91 and $219.",

The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

            "model_answer": "The teachers' union wants to argue for higher salaries, so they would want to use a measure of central tendency that is higher than the current average salary. The mean can be easily skewed by a few high salaries, so it may not accurately represent the typical salary. The mode is not very useful in this case since there are likely many different salaries that occur with similar frequency. The standard deviation measures the spread of the salaries, but it doesn't necessarily indicate whether the salaries are high or low. The median, however, represents the middle salary when all salaries are arranged in order. If the median is higher than the current average salary, the teachers' union can argue that many teachers are being paid less than they deserve. Therefore, the teachers' union would most likely quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations. \n\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",

            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is false, we need to compare the medians, means, and ranges of the two sets.\n\nThe median of a set is the middle value when the values are arranged in order. To find the median of X, we arrange the values in order: {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}. The middle value is 50. To find the median of Y, we arrange the values in order: {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}. The middle value is also 50. Therefore, statement (A) is true.\n\nThe mean of a set is the sum of the values divided by the number of values. To find the mean of X, we add up all the values and divide by 7: (10+30+45+50+55+70+90)/7 = 50. To find the mean of Y, we add up all the values and divide by 7: (10+30+35+50+65+70+90)/7 = 50. Therefore, statement (B) is true.\n\nThe range of a set is the difference between the largest and smallest values. To find the range of X, we subtract the smallest value (10) from the largest value (90): 90-10 = 80. To find the range of Y, we subtract the smallest value (10) from the largest value (90): 90-10 = 80.
