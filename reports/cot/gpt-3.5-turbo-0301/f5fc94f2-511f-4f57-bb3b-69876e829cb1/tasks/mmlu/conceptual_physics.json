            "model_answer": "Step 1: Recall the predictions of general relativity.\nStep 2: Consider each option and determine if it is a prediction of general relativity.\nStep 3: Determine if any of the options are mutually exclusive or if they can all be true at the same time.\nStep 4: Output the answer.\n\nStep 1: General relativity is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein. It predicts that gravity is not a force between masses, but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. This curvature affects the motion of objects and the propagation of light.\n\nStep 2: \n(A) According to general relativity, gravity can cause the path of light to curve. This means that light leaving the Sun can be deflected by the Sun's gravity. Therefore, option (A) is a prediction of general relativity.\n(B) As mentioned above, general relativity predicts that gravity can cause the path of light to curve. This means that light passing the Sun can be deflected by the Sun's gravity. Therefore, option (B) is a prediction of general relativity.\n(C) General relativity predicts that time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational fields. This means that a clock on the Sun's surface, which is closer to the center of the Sun's gravitational field, would run slower than a clock on Earth. Therefore, option (C) is not a prediction of general relativity.\n\nStep 3: Options (A) and (B) are not mutually exclusive, as both can be true at the same time. Option (C) is not a prediction of general relativity, so it does not affect the possibility of options (A) and (B) being true.\n\nStep 4: Since options (A) and (B) are both predictions of general relativity and are not mutually exclusive, the answer is (D) All of these.",
