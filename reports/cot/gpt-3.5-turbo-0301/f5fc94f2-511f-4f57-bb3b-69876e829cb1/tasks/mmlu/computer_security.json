Option D is also unlikely to be the correct answer as Nmap is not a suite of tools for scripting attacks.\nStep 5: Consider option A. This option describes Nmap as a scanner that injects packets to a range of addresses and infers what hosts and services might be at those addresses based on the responses.

These attacks occur when a program tries to store more data in a buffer than it was designed to hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. This can overwrite important data or instructions, allowing the attacker to take control of the system.\n\nOlder operating systems like Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT were particularly vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks because they did not have built-in protections against them. In contrast, modern operating systems like Windows 7, Chrome, and IOS12 have implemented various security measures to prevent buffer-overflow attacks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) UNIX.",
