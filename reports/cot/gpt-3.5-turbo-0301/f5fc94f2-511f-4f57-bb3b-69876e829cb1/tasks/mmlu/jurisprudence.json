This is inconsistent with Dworkin's claim that there is only one right answer. \n\nTherefore, option (C) is the most inconsistent proposition with Dworkin's claim. \n\nAnswer: C",

This is because the standard requires a person to act as a reasonable person with the same physical disability would act in a similar situation.

Option (B) is incorrect because the standard focuses on the defendant's behavior rather than their subjective mental state.
