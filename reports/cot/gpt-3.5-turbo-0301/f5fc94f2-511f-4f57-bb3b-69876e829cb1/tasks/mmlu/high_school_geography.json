            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To determine which country is least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, we need to consider which country relies the most on imports for these resources. \n\nThe United States has significant natural resources, including oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals, and is also a major producer of agricultural products. While the US does import some resources, it is relatively self-sufficient overall.\n\nJapan, on the other hand, has very limited natural resources and relies heavily on imports for energy, metals, and other materials needed for industry. Therefore, Japan is a strong candidate for being the least self-sufficient.\n\nFrance has some natural resources, including uranium, but also relies on imports for many materials. However, it is not as heavily reliant on imports as Japan.\n\nThe United Kingdom has significant natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and minerals, and is also a major producer of agricultural products. While it does import some resources, it is relatively self-sufficient overall.\n\nTherefore, the country that is LEAST self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry is (B) Japan.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process by which a new fashion design is introduced globally can be analyzed using the different types of diffusion. \n\nContagious diffusion occurs when a cultural trait spreads continuously outward from its hearth through contact among people. This type of diffusion is more common for ideas or behaviors that are easily transmitted, such as rumors or diseases. However, it is less likely to occur for fashion designs, as they require more deliberate adoption and may not be easily transmitted through contact alone. \n\nRelocation diffusion occurs when people move from one place to another and bring their cultural traits with them. This type of diffusion is more common for physical objects, such as tools or clothing, that can be transported. However, it is less likely to occur for fashion designs, as they may not be practical or desirable in different environments or cultures. \n\nInnovative diffusion occurs when a cultural trait is created or invented in one place and then diffuses to other places. This type of diffusion is more common for new ideas or technologies, such as social media or smartphones. However, it is more likely to occur for fashion designs, as they are often created by designers and then marketed to consumers globally. \n\nHierarchical diffusion occurs when a cultural trait spreads from a higher level of authority or power to lower levels. This type of diffusion is more common for political or economic systems, such as democracy or capitalism. However, it is also likely to occur for fashion designs, as they may be adopted by celebrities or influencers who have a significant influence on consumer behavior. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer for the process by which a new fashion design is introduced globally is (D) hierarchical diffusion.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation.\nGunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation is a theory of economic development that explains how initial advantages or disadvantages of a region can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of growth or decline. According to this theory, regions with initial advantages (such as access to natural resources, capital, or technology) are able to attract more labor, capital, and trade, which leads to further growth and prosperity. On the other hand, regions with initial disadvantages (such as lack of resources or infrastructure) are stuck in a cycle of poverty and decline.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement and determine if it is part of Myrdal's theory.\n(A) Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade. - This statement is not part of Myrdal's theory. Myrdal's theory focuses on the relationship between regions with initial advantages or disadvantages, rather than the relationship between developing and developed regions.\n\n(B) The core will always dominate the periphery. - This statement is part of Myrdal's theory. Myrdal argues that regions with initial advantages (the \"core\") will dominate regions with initial disadvantages (the \"periphery\").\n\n(C) Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery. - This statement is part of Myrdal's theory. Myrdal argues that the growth and prosperity of the core is achieved at the expense of the periphery, which is stuck in a cycle of poverty and decline.\n\n(D) Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade. - This statement is part of Myrdal's theory. Myrdal argues that regions with initial advantages are able to attract more labor, capital, and trade, which leads to further growth and prosperity.\n\nStep 3: Determine the statement that is NOT part of Myrdal's theory.\nStatement (A) is not part of Myrdal's theory.\n\nAnswer: A",
