            "model_answer": "Randomization of study subjects in a clinical trial is most helpful for controlling for (A) Placebo effect. \n\nReasoning: \nRandomization is the process of assigning study subjects to different groups in a way that each subject has an equal chance of being assigned to any of the groups. This helps to minimize the differences between the groups at the start of the study, including any potential confounding factors that could affect the outcome. The placebo effect refers to the phenomenon where a patient's belief in the treatment can lead to an improvement in symptoms, even if the treatment itself is inactive. Randomization helps to control for the placebo effect by ensuring that both the treatment and control groups have an equal chance of experiencing the placebo effect. Therefore, randomization is most helpful for controlling for the placebo effect. \n\nAnswer: (A)",

This suggests that the study is not a clinical trial, as clinical trials typically involve testing the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention. The study is also not double-blind, as there is no mention of a control group or random assignment to treatment and control groups. The study is longitudinal, as it involves observing the same group of people over time. Finally, the study is prospective cohort, as it involves following a group of people who are exposed to a particular risk factor (the environmental toxin) and observing them over time to determine the potential effects of that risk factor.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The papilloma family of viruses cause cancer through multiple mechanisms. One of the main mechanisms is that they replicate in dividing cells and encode three oncogenic proteins E5, E6 and E7. These proteins can interfere with the normal cell cycle regulation and promote uncontrolled cell growth, leading to the development of cancer. Additionally, some strains of papilloma viruses can integrate their viral genome into the cellular DNA, which can disrupt normal gene expression and contribute to cancer development. However, the papilloma viruses do not have an oncogene able to initiate cancer on their own, nor do they act as a co-factor for a cellular oncogene. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Replicate in dividing cells and encodes three oncogenic proteins E5, E6 and E7.",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what disease prevention means. Disease prevention refers to measures taken to prevent the occurrence of a disease or to slow its progression. \n\nOption (A) Vaccines: Vaccines are a form of preventive medicine that helps to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases. They work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against specific pathogens. Vaccines are effective in preventing many infectious diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, and polio.\n\nOption (B) Antivirals: Antivirals are medications that are used to treat viral infections. They work by inhibiting the replication of the virus, which can help to reduce the severity of the infection. However, antivirals are not typically used for disease prevention.\n\nOption (C) Hygiene: Hygiene refers to practices that help to maintain cleanliness and prevent the spread of disease. Examples of hygiene practices include washing hands regularly, covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. Good hygiene practices can help to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nOption (D) Mosquito nets: Mosquito nets are used to prevent mosquito bites, which can transmit diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus. Mosquito nets are effective in preventing these diseases, particularly in areas where mosquitoes are prevalent.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the option that can most often prevent disease is (A) Vaccines.",
