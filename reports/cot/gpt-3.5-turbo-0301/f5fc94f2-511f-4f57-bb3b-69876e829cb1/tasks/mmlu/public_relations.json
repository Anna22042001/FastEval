            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what predispositions are. Predispositions are pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, or opinions that a person has towards a particular issue. \n\nNext, we need to consider the different forms of communication listed: interpersonal, media, group, and public. \n\nInterpersonal communication refers to communication between two or more people, such as face-to-face conversations. \n\nMedia communication refers to communication through various forms of media, such as television, radio, newspapers, and social media. \n\nGroup communication refers to communication within a group setting, such as a discussion or debate among a group of people. \n\nPublic communication refers to communication to a large audience, such as a speech or presentation. \n\nBased on research, interpersonal communication is generally considered the most effective form of communication in forming or changing predispositions towards an issue. This is because interpersonal communication allows for more personal and direct interaction, which can lead to greater persuasion and influence. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) Interpersonal.",

            "model_answer": "1. The question is asking about which publics help an organization to exist by lending authority or assistance, according to Esman (1972).\n2. To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of publics in organizational communication.\n3. Publics refer to groups of people who have a stake in an organization and can affect or be affected by its actions and decisions.\n4. Esman (1972) identified three types of publics: enabling, normative, and functional.\n5. Enabling publics are those who provide resources or support to an organization, such as investors, donors, or suppliers.\n6. Normative publics are those who share values or beliefs with an organization, such as customers, employees, or community members.\n7. Functional publics are those who have a specific role or function in relation to an organization, such as regulators, media, or competitors.\n8.

Mati Ventrillon claimed that Chanel's design was nearly identical to one of their own designs, which had been featured in a 2016 issue of British Vogue. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Chanel.",

The first option, (A), suggests that audiences are even more passive and vulnerable than they were in the past, which is not supported by current research. The second option, (B), is a specific claim about the effects of television viewing on the brain, but it does not address the broader question of audience passivity or vulnerability. The third option, (C), acknowledges that audiences are not passive recipients of media messages and that the way individuals receive and interpret messages can vary. This is consistent with current thinking in the field of mass communication. The fourth option, (D), suggests that technology has made audiences more passive, but this is not necessarily true. While some forms of technology may make it easier for audiences to tune out or ignore messages, others may actually increase engagement and interactivity. Therefore, (C) is the best answer.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the concept of licensing in general. Licensing is a process by which a government agency grants permission to an individual or organization to engage in a particular activity or profession. The purpose of licensing is typically to protect the public from harm or fraud and to ensure that those engaged in the licensed activity meet certain standards of competence and ethical behavior.\n\nStep 2: Apply this understanding to the field of public relations. Public relations is a profession that involves managing communication between an organization and its various stakeholders, including the media, customers, employees, and the general public. Because public relations practitioners have the potential to influence public opinion and behavior, there is a need to ensure that they are competent and ethical in their work.\n\nStep 3: Consider the options provided. \n\n(A) To regulate access to posts in the field: This option suggests that licensing is primarily about controlling who can enter the field of public relations. While licensing may have some impact on who is able to work in the field, this is not its primary purpose.\n\n(B) To create an elite of public relations practitioners: This option suggests that licensing is intended to create a privileged group of practitioners who are able to charge higher fees or enjoy other benefits. While licensing may confer some advantages on those who hold a license, this is not its primary purpose.\n\n(C) To preserve the well-being of society: This option suggests that licensing is intended to protect the public from harm or fraud and to ensure that public relations practitioners meet certain standards of competence and ethical behavior. This is consistent with the general purpose of licensing as described in Step 1.\n\n(D) To achieve better wages for licensed practitioners: This option suggests that licensing is intended to increase the earning potential of public relations practitioners. While licensing may have some impact on wages, this is not its primary purpose.\n\nStep 4: Select the best answer. Based on the above analysis, the best answer is (C) To preserve the well-being of society.\n\nAnswer: (C)",
