            "model_answer": "International legal personality refers to the ability of an entity to have rights and obligations under international law. States and international organizations are recognized as having international legal personality. However, the question is asking about individuals. While individuals do not have the same level of international legal personality as States and international organizations, they do have some recognition under international law. For example, individuals can bring claims before certain international courts and tribunals. Therefore, the answer is (A) Individuals enjoy international legal personality, but this is limited.",

While the Court did refer to the 'living instrument principle' in its reasoning, the case did not involve a significant evolution of the interpretation of the Convention.\n\n(B) A v UK (2009) concerned the detention of an individual with a mental disorder.

The Court held that the 'living instrument principle' required an interpretation of the Convention that took into account the changing social attitudes towards transsexualism.\n\n(D) Osman v UK (1998) dealt with the right to life and the duty of the state to protect individuals from threats to their life.
