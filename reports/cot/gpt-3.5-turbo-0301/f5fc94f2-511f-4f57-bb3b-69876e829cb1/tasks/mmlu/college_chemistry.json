            "model_answer": "To determine which statement is true about optical isomerism of complexes containing achiral ligands, we need to understand the conditions under which optical isomerism can occur. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule or complex has a non-superimposable mirror image, also known as enantiomers. This occurs when the molecule or complex has a chiral center, which is an atom that is bonded to four different groups. \n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is false. Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism if they have two identical ligands and two different ligands. This creates a chiral center at the metal atom.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is false. Tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if they have four different ligands, creating a chiral center at the metal atom.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is false. Linear complexes cannot display optical isomerism because they do not have a chiral center.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is true. Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism if they have three or more different ligands, creating a chiral center at the metal atom.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "To determine the number of allowed energy levels for the 55Mn nuclide, we need to consider its nuclear properties. Specifically, we need to look at the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, as well as their arrangement.\n\n55Mn has 25 protons and 30 neutrons. These particles are arranged in energy levels or shells, similar to the way electrons are arranged in atoms. The number of energy levels or shells in a nucleus is determined by the total number of nucleons (protons + neutrons) and their arrangement.\n\nTo determine the number of allowed energy levels for 55Mn, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of energy levels = 2n\u00b2\n\nwhere n is the number of the highest energy level. The highest energy level is determined by the number of nucleons and their arrangement.\n\nFor 55Mn, the total number of nucleons is 55 (25 protons + 30 neutrons). To determine the highest energy level, we need to fill up the lower energy levels with nucleons according to the following rules:\n\n- Each energy level can hold a maximum of 2n\u00b2 nucleons.\n- The energy levels are filled in order of increasing energy, starting with the lowest energy level.\n\nUsing these rules, we can fill up the energy levels for 55Mn as follows:\n\n- The first energy level (n=1) can hold a maximum of 2(1)\u00b2 = 2 nucleons. We fill this level with 2 protons.\n- The second energy level (n=2) can hold a maximum of 2(2)\u00b2 = 8 nucleons. We fill this level with 8 nucleons: 6 neutrons and 2 protons.\n- The third energy level (n=3) can hold a maximum of 2(3)\u00b2 = 18 nucleons. We fill this level with 17 neutrons and 1 proton.\n- The fourth energy level (n=4) can hold a maximum of 2(4)\u00b2 = 32 nucleons. We fill this level with 4 neutrons.\n\nAt this point, all 55 nucleons have been accounted for, and we have filled up 4 energy levels. Therefore, the number of allowed energy levels for 55Mn is (D) 4.",

To do this, we need to eliminate n and m from the equations above. We can do this by dividing the second equation by the first:\n\n3\u03b1/\u03b1 = m/n * [DMSO]/[AN]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n3 = (m/n) * [DMSO]/[AN]\n\nWe still have two unknowns, but we can make an assumption about the ratio of protons in DMSO and AN. Both molecules contain a methyl group (-CH3), which will give rise to a singlet in the spectrum. Let's assume that both molecules also contain a methylene group (-CH2-), which will give rise to a triplet in the spectrum. This means that n = 2 and m = 4. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n\n3 = (4/2) * [DMSO]/[AN]\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n3 = 2 * [DMSO]/[AN]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n3/2 = [DMSO]/[AN]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the two concentrations is 3:2, or (D).",

The more electronegative atoms or groups nearby will deshield the proton, causing it to have a higher chemical shift value. In this case, we are looking for the compound with a proton that has a chemical shift of approximately 1.55 kHz at 12.0 T.\n\nWe can use the equation: \n\n\u0394\u03bd = (\u03b3/2\u03c0) * B0 * \u03b4\n\nwhere \u0394\u03bd is the frequency difference between the resonance of the proton and TMS, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio (constant for each nucleus), B0 is the magnetic field strength, and \u03b4 is the chemical shift of the proton in parts per million (ppm).\n\nSince we are given the magnetic field strength (12.0 T), we can rearrange the equation to solve for \u03b4:\n\n\u03b4 = \u0394\u03bd / [(\u03b3/2\u03c0) * B0]\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio for 1H is constant, so we can ignore it for the purposes of comparing the different compounds.\n\nPlugging in the values for \u0394\u03bd and B0, we get:\n\n\u03b4 = 1.55 kHz / [(1/2\u03c0) * 12.0 T]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\u03b4 \u2248 0.104 ppm\n\nNow we need to look at the compounds and determine which one has a proton with a chemical shift close to 0.104 ppm. \n\nThe electronegativity of the halogens increases from F to I, so we would expect the proton in CH3F to be shielded the most and the proton in CH3I to be deshielded the most.
