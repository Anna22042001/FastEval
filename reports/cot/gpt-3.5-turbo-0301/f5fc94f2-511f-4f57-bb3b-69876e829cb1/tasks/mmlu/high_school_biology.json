            "model_answer": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify a specific segment of DNA. The following components are required for performing PCR:\n\n(A) Reverse transcriptase: Reverse transcriptase is not required for PCR. It is used in reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to convert RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) before amplification.\n\n(B) A vacuum chamber: A vacuum chamber is not required for PCR. It is used in other techniques such as vacuum filtration.\n\n(C) Primers complementary to certain portions of the DNA: Primers are short DNA sequences that are complementary to the regions flanking the target DNA sequence. They are required for PCR as they provide a starting point for DNA polymerase to initiate amplification.\n\n(D) DNA ligase: DNA ligase is not required for PCR. It is used in other techniques such as DNA cloning to join DNA fragments together.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) directional selection.\n\nExplanation:\nArtificial selection is when humans intentionally breed organisms with desirable traits, which is not the case here as it is a natural process. Stabilizing selection is when natural selection favors the average phenotype and selects against extreme variations, which is not the case here as the horses are gradually increasing in size. Disruptive selection is when natural selection favors extreme variations of a trait and selects against the average phenotype, which is also not the case here as the horses are not becoming more variable in size. Therefore, the best term to describe the gradual increase in size of horses over time is directional selection, which is when natural selection favors one extreme of a trait and selects against the other extreme.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Interspecific breeding refers to the mating between two different species. In order for interspecific breeding to occur, the potential mates must be able to successfully mate and produce viable offspring. There are several factors that can prevent interspecific breeding from occurring.\n\nOption (A) states that geographic isolation can prevent interspecific breeding. This means that the potential mates are physically separated by a geographic barrier, such as a mountain range or a body of water, which prevents them from coming into contact with each other. Geographic isolation can lead to the development of different species over time, as the isolated populations evolve independently. Therefore, option (A) can prevent interspecific breeding.\n\nOption (B) states that behavioral isolation can prevent interspecific breeding. This means that the potential mates have different behaviors or mating rituals that prevent them from successfully mating with each other. For example, one species may have a specific courtship display that is only recognized by members of the same species. Therefore, option (B) can prevent interspecific breeding.\n\nOption (C) states that different courtship rituals can prevent interspecific breeding. This is similar to option (B), as courtship rituals are a type of behavior that can prevent successful mating between different species. Therefore, option (C) can prevent interspecific breeding.\n\nOption (D) states that similar breeding seasons cannot prevent interspecific breeding. This means that even if two different species have similar breeding seasons, they may still be able to successfully mate with each other and produce viable offspring. Therefore, option (D) does not prevent interspecific breeding.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",
