            "question": "An investor and a developer own adjoining lots in the central portion of a city. Each of their lots had an office building on it. The developer decided to raze the existing building on her lot and to erect a building of greater height. The developer has received all governmental approvals required to pursue her project. There is no applicable statute or ordinance (other than those dealing with various approvals for zoning, building, etc. ). After the developer had torn down the existing building, she proceeded to excavate deeper. The developer used shoring that met all local, state, and federal safety regulations, and the shoring was placed in accordance with those standards. The investor notified the developer that cracks were developing in the building situated on the investor's lot. The developer took the view that any subsidence suffered by the investor was due to the weight of the investor's building and correctly asserted that none would have occurred had the investor's land been in its natural state. The developer continued to excavate. The building on the investor's lot did suffer extensive damage, requiring the expenditure of $750,000 to remedy the defects. Which of the following is the best comment concerning the investor's action to recover damages from the developer?\n\n(A) The developer is liable, because she removed necessary support for the investor's lot.\n(B) The developer cannot be held liable simply upon proof that support was removed, but may be held liable if negligence is proved.\n(C) Once land is improved with a building, the owner cannot invoke the right of lateral support.\n(D) The developer's only obligation was to satisf' all local, state, and federal safety regulations.",

            "question": "An incumbent was running for re-election as the mayor of a city. During one of his opponent's campaign speeches, he stated that the mayor had once propositioned a prostitute. A television correspondent who was covering the election was present when the opponent made the statement. She recorded the opponent's remark about the mayor in her notebook. In a stunning upset, the opponent defeated the mayor in the election. Many of the pollsters attributed the mayor's loss to the question of his moral character following the opponent's smear campaign depicting the mayor as a client of prostitutes. Following the election, the mayor sued the opponent for defamation, basing his suit on the opponent's statement that the mayor had \"once propositioned a prostitute. \" At trial, the mayor calls the television correspondent to testify concerning her recollection of what the opponent said during the campaign speech attended by the television correspondent. The television correspondent's testimony is\n\n(A) admissible, because the television correspondent recorded the opponent's statement in her business capacity.\n(B) admissible, because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement.\n(C) inadmissible, because the notebook entry is the best evidence.\n(D) inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.",

However, this does not address the issue of hearsay.\n\nStep 5: Option (B) suggests that the testimony is admissible because the television correspondent had firsthand knowledge of the opponent's statement. This is a better argument because firsthand knowledge is generally admissible.\n\nStep 6: Option (C) suggests that the notebook entry is the best evidence, but this does not address the issue of hearsay.\n\nStep 7: Option (D) suggests that the testimony is inadmissible because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception. This is the correct answer because the television correspondent's testimony is hearsay since she is testifying about what someone else said. There is no recognized exception that would allow this testimony to be admitted.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

They stopped their patrol car and walked over to the man, whom they recognized as a troublemaker from the neighboring town.

They would either take him to jail for the night or drive him to the city limits and drop him off there. The man indicated that he didn't want to go to jail.

Concerned about being able to fulfill contractual commitments, the president instructed his staff to deliver the defective lot. A cancer patient who had been maintained on the drug died shortly after beginning to take the defective pills.

On appeal, he argues that his conviction should be reversed. Should the conviction be reversed?\n\n(A) No, because the intentional delivery of adulterated or mislabeled drugs gives rise to strict criminal liability.\n(B) No, because the jury could have found that the president\u00d5s conduct was sufficiently reckless to constitute murder.\n(C) Yes, because distribution of the defective lot was only a regulatory offense.\n(D) Yes, because the cancer, not the president\u00d5s conduct, was the proximate cause of death of the patient.",

We are given four options: disputes involving ambassadors, public ministers and consuls, different states, and a state as a party.\n\nWe can eliminate options (A) and (B) because the Constitution explicitly grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over cases involving ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls. Therefore, lower federal courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction in these cases.\n\nOption (C) involves disputes between different states. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over cases \"between two or more states.\" However, Congress has also given lower federal courts concurrent jurisdiction in these cases. Therefore, option (C) is not the correct answer.\n\nOption (D) involves a state as a party. The Constitution does not explicitly grant the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over cases involving a state as a party. However, in the landmark case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), the Supreme Court held that it did have jurisdiction over such cases. This decision was later overturned by the Eleventh Amendment, which grants states sovereign immunity and prohibits federal courts from hearing cases brought against a state by citizens of another state or foreign country.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) a state as a party.",

In 1997, the rancher conveyed the 200-acre tract for a consideration of one dollar, receipt of which was acknowledged, \"to my uncle, his heirs, and assigns, but if my uncle's wife dies without issue, to my personal assistant and her heirs and assigns. \"After taking possession of the 200-acre tract, the uncle discovered considerable oil reserves on the property. He then began oil drilling operations and removed large quantities of oil, which he sold. At no time did he give notice to the personal assistant of his oil-drilling activities. Months passed before the personal assistant learned that the uncle was selling oil from the drilling operations.

When the rancher conveyed the 200-acre tract to his uncle, he did so with a condition attached - if the uncle's wife dies without issue, the property goes to the personal assistant. This creates a defeasible fee simple, which means that the uncle's ownership of the property is subject to a condition. \n\nIn this case, the condition was not met, so the uncle retained ownership of the property. However, the personal assistant still has an interest in the property - specifically, the right to receive the property if the condition is met. \n\nThe personal assistant is now seeking an accounting of the value of the oil removed from the property and an injunction against any further removal. The question is why the decision would be in favor of the uncle. \n\nThe answer is (A) - the right to remove oil is an incident of a defeasible fee simple. Because the uncle has a defeasible fee simple in the property, he has the right to remove oil from it. The personal assistant's interest in the property does not give her the right to control the property or prevent the uncle from using it in this way. \n\nTherefore, if the decision is in favor of the uncle, it will be because he has the right to remove oil from the property as the owner of a defeasible fee simple.",
