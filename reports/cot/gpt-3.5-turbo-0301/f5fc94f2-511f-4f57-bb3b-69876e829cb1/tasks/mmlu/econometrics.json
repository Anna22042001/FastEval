Trading rule profitability measures the profit or loss generated by a trading strategy. There is no inherent relationship between MSE and trading rule profitability, so statement A is false.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate statement B.\nMean absolute error (MAE) measures the average of the absolute differences between the forecasted values and the actual values. MAE does not provide a quadratic loss function, so statement B is false.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate statement C.\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE) measures the average of the absolute percentage differences between the forecasted values and the actual values. MAPE is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of asset return forecasts, so statement C is true.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate statement D.\nMSE penalizes large forecast errors more than small forecast errors because it involves squaring the differences between the forecasted values and the actual values. This means that larger errors have a greater impact on the overall measure than smaller errors.
