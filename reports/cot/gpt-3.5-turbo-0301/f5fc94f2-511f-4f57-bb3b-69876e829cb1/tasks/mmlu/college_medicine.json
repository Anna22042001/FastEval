One way it does this is by increasing the amount of water lost through the skin via sweating. This allows for evaporative cooling, which helps to lower body temperature.

            "model_answer": "Lactate is produced by muscles during exercise and can enter the circulation. The fate of lactate depends on the metabolic needs of the body. Option A, conversion to urea in the liver, is not a correct answer because lactate is not a precursor for urea synthesis. Option B, conversion to glucose in the heart, is also not a correct answer because lactate cannot be converted to glucose in the heart. Option C, excretion via the kidneys, is not a correct answer because lactate is not primarily excreted by the kidneys. The correct answer is option D, uptake and oxidation by other tissues. Lactate can be taken up and oxidized by other tissues, such as the heart, liver, and brain, for energy production. Therefore, the main fate of lactate that leaves muscle and enters the circulation is uptake and oxidation by other tissues. The answer is (D).",

Adenine and guanine are purines, while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. In a double stranded molecule of DNA, each base on one strand is paired with a complementary base on the other strand. Adenine always pairs with thymine, and guanine always pairs with cytosine. Therefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is always equal on each strand. Thus, the answer is (D) always 1:1.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what an intracellular buffer is and how it works. An intracellular buffer is a molecule that can accept or donate protons (H+) to maintain a stable pH within a cell. When the rate of glycolysis is high, there is an increase in the production of protons, which can lead to a decrease in pH. Therefore, an intracellular buffer is needed to prevent this decrease in pH.\n\n(A) Glutamine is an amino acid that can act as an intracellular buffer, but it is not directly involved in glycolysis.\n\n(B) Glucose is a sugar that is broken down during glycolysis, so it cannot act as an intracellular buffer.\n\n(C) Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of histidine and beta-alanine. It is known to act as an intracellular buffer in muscle cells, but it is not directly involved in glycolysis.\n\n(D) Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into glucose, but it cannot act as an intracellular buffer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Glutamine.",

            "model_answer": "During intense exercise, the body produces lactate as a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism. This lactate can accumulate in the blood and muscles, leading to fatigue and decreased performance. In soccer, players engage in high-intensity activity for extended periods of time, which can lead to an increase in blood lactate concentration. \n\nOption A states that the blood lactate concentration rarely increases above 3 mM. This is not accurate, as studies have shown that during soccer games, blood lactate concentrations can reach levels as high as 10-12 mM.\n\nOption B suggests that the blood lactate concentration is usually lower at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This is also not accurate, as studies have shown that blood lactate concentrations tend to increase throughout the course of the game, with the highest levels occurring in the second half.\n\nOption C suggests that the blood lactate concentration is usually higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half. This is accurate, as mentioned above, blood lactate concentrations tend to increase throughout the game, with the highest levels occurring in the second half.\n\nOption D suggests that the blood lactate concentration increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued. This is also accurate, as the accumulation of lactate in the blood is a sign of fatigue and decreased performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C).",
