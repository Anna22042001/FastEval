            "question": "When Antoinette comes home to her apartment, people suddenly jump out towards her. Her heart begins to race and she shrieks. Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The James-Lange theory of emotions proposes that emotions are a result of physiological responses to stimuli. In this scenario, Antoinette's heart racing and her shriek are the physiological responses to the sudden appearance of people jumping out towards her. Once she recognizes that it is her friends, her emotional response changes from fear to happiness, but her heart continues to race. This supports the idea that the physiological response (racing heart) comes before the emotional experience. Therefore, the best theory of emotions that explains this scenario is (C) James-Lange. \n\nAnswer: (C)",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Physiological arousal refers to the body's response to stress or excitement. The options given are all physical responses that can occur during physiological arousal. Therefore, we need to identify the option that is not a characteristic of physiological arousal. \n\nOption (B) increase in salivation is not a characteristic of physiological arousal. In fact, salivation is more likely to decrease during physiological arousal due to the body's fight or flight response. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: The question is asking why it is unlikely for a psychologist to condition a baby to fear a rat and other small animals in a research study at a university today.\n\nStep 2: Option A is not a valid reason because it assumes that the only reason a psychologist would not conduct such a study is because parents would not allow it. This is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 3: Option B is a valid reason. Ethical guidelines for research studies involving human subjects have become increasingly strict over time, and it is unlikely that a study that involves conditioning a baby to fear small animals would be approved by an institutional review board.\n\nStep 4: Option C is not a valid reason. Babies are capable of experiencing fear, and there is evidence to suggest that they can develop phobias at a young age.\n\nStep 5: Option D is not a valid reason. While it is true that conditioning experiments are not as common as they once were, they are still conducted in some areas of psychology.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the correct answer is (B) the study violates ethical guidelines.",
