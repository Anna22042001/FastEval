Through this project, scientists were able to identify and annotate protein-coding genes. Initially, it was estimated that there were around 30,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome. However, as more advanced sequencing technologies and computational methods have been developed, this estimate has been revised. \n\nCurrently, it is estimated that there are between 19,000-20,000 protein-coding genes in the human genome.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. Mutations in the CFTR gene can lead to the production of a faulty protein that disrupts this balance, causing the buildup of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, pancreas, and other organs.\n\nThe most common mutation in the CFTR gene is known as deltaF508, which is a deletion of three nucleotides (CTT) that results in the loss of a single amino acid (phenylalanine) from the CFTR protein. This mutation is found in about 70% of people with cystic fibrosis in the United States and Europe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) a deletion.",

However, in genome-wide association studies, known SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) have been found to explain only a small proportion of the variation in BMI. This suggests that there are likely many other genetic factors that contribute to BMI that have not yet been identified. \n\nTherefore, the answer is either (A) only 5% or (C) only 13%.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that both parents must be carriers of the PKU gene for their child to be affected. If only one parent is a carrier, the child will not have PKU but will be a carrier like the parent. \n\nIf a mother with PKU is untreated during pregnancy, high levels of phenylalanine can cross the placenta and harm the developing fetus. This can lead to intellectual disability, delayed development, behavioral problems, and seizures in the child. \n\nTherefore, the risk of abnormality in the child of a mother with untreated PKU is high. However, the exact risk depends on whether the father is a carrier or affected by PKU. If the father is unaffected and not a carrier, the risk is 25% that the child will have PKU, 50% that the child will be a carrier like the mother, and 25% that the child will not have PKU or be a carrier. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 25%.",

The name of the disorder suggests that it is familial, meaning it runs in families, and that it is related to cholesterol. Therefore, we can eliminate options (A) and (B) as they are not directly related to cholesterol. \n\nHigh density lipoprotein (HDL) is often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol, as it helps to remove excess cholesterol from the blood. HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. \n\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL) is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol, as it can build up in the walls of arteries and lead to atherosclerosis. The LDL receptor is a protein that is responsible for removing LDL from the blood. Mutations in the gene that encodes the LDL receptor can lead to familial hypercholesterolaemia, as the body is unable to remove excess LDL from the blood. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Low density lipoprotein receptor.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of inbreeding coefficient, F.\nThe question is asking about the effect of an increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, on a population. Inbreeding coefficient, F, is a measure of the probability that two alleles at any locus in an individual are identical by descent, meaning they are inherited from a common ancestor. In other words, it measures the degree of relatedness between individuals in a population.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each answer choice.\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population: This is correct. Inbreeding increases the probability of homozygosity, meaning that individuals are more likely to inherit two copies of the same allele from a common ancestor. This reduces the likelihood of heterozygotes, which have two different alleles at a given locus.\n\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage: This is incorrect. Inbreeding can increase the frequency of homozygous genotypes, but it does not necessarily affect the proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\n(C) higher proportion of genes with introns: This is incorrect. Inbreeding does not affect the proportion of genes with introns, which are non-coding regions of DNA.\n\n(D) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells: This is incorrect. Inbreeding does not affect the level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells, which is determined by processes such as transcription and splicing.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer.\nThe correct answer is (A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population.\n\nAnswer: A",
