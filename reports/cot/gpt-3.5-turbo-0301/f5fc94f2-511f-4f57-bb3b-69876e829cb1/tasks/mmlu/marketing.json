This is often used for new or innovative products where early adopters are willing to pay a premium. \n\nOption (C) - Economy pricing - involves setting a low price to appeal to price-sensitive consumers. However, this strategy is not necessarily focused on gaining market share, but rather on maintaining a low price point. \n\nOption (D) - Penetration pricing - is the correct answer, as it involves setting a low price to gain market share.
