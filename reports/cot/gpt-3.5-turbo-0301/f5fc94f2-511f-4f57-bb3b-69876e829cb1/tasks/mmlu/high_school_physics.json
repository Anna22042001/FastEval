The ball's acceleration is not zero at the highest point. It is experiencing a downward acceleration due to gravity and an upward acceleration due to air resistance. These two forces are not balanced, so the net acceleration is not zero.\nIII. True. The ball takes a longer time to travel up to the highest point than to fall back down because it is slowing down due to the force of gravity and air resistance on the way up, but speeding up due to gravity on the way down. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) I & III only.",

The force on A is given by F = k * (2Q) * Q / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant and r is the distance between the particles.

The initial momentum is 0 (since the small cart is at rest), and the final momentum is (4m)(v') where v' is the velocity of the large cart after the collision. Therefore:\n\n0 = (4m)(v')\nv' = 0\n\nSo the large cart comes to a complete stop after the collision.\n\nStep 2: Use conservation of energy to find the velocity of the small cart after the collision.\n\nWe know that the small cart gains half of the kinetic energy lost by the large cart. Let's call the initial kinetic energy of the system K1, and the final kinetic energy of the system K2. Then:\n\nK1 = (1/2)(4m)(v^2) = 2mv^2\nK2 = (1/2)(4m)(0^2) + (1/2)m(v')^2 = (1/2)mv'^2\n\nThe change in kinetic energy is:\n\n\u0394K = K2 - K1 = (1/2)mv'^2 - 2mv^2\n\nWe know that the large cart loses half of its kinetic energy, so:\n\n(1/2)(4m)(v^2) - (1/2)(4m)(0^2) = (1/2)(1/2)mv'^2\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2mv^2 = (1/4)mv'^2\n8v^2 = v'^2\nv' = 2v\u221a2\n\nSo the velocity of the small cart after the collision is 2v\u221a2.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer.\n\nThe question asks for the velocity of the small cart after the collision.

However, the problem states that the object floats, so we know that at least part of the object is above the surface of the water.\n\nStep 4: Find the weight of the water displaced by the object\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the weight of the water displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the object when it is fully submerged. Since the object is floating, we know that the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nWeight of water displaced = Weight of object = 6 N\n\nStep 5: Find the volume of water displaced by the object\nDensity of water = Mass of water / Volume of water\nVolume of water = Mass of water / Density of water\n\nSince the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the object, we can use the same formula to find the volume of water displaced.\n\nVolume of water displaced = Mass of object / Density of water\nVolume of water displaced = (6 N) / (1000 kg/m^3)\nVolume of water displaced = 0.006 m^3\n\nStep 6: Find the percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water\nThe volume of the part of the object that is above the surface of the water is equal to the total volume of the object minus the volume of water displaced.\n\nVolume above water = Total volume of object - Volume of water displaced\nVolume above water = (2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3) - (0.006 m^3)\nVolume above water = -0.004 m^3\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense! The volume above the water is negative, which means that the object is completely submerged. But we know that the object is floating. What went wrong?\n\nThe problem is that we made an assumption in Step 6 that turned out to be incorrect. We assumed that the entire volume of the object was submerged in the water, and that the volume above the water was equal to the total volume of the object minus the volume of water displaced. However, this assumption is not correct, because the object is floating. This means that only part of the object is submerged, and the rest is above the surface of the water.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need to use a different approach. We know that the weight of the water displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the object. We also know that the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the water that is displaced by the part of the object that is submerged. Therefore, we can find the volume of the part of the object that is submerged by dividing the weight of the object by the density of water, and then use this to find the volume of the part of the object that is above the surface of the water.\n\nStep 7: Find the volume of the part of the object that is submerged\nVolume of submerged part = Weight of object / Density of water\nVolume of submerged part = 6 N / (1000 kg/m^3)\nVolume of submerged part = 0.006 m^3\n\nStep 8: Find the volume of the part of the object that is above the surface of the water\nVolume above water = Total volume of object - Volume of submerged part\nVolume above water = (2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3) - (0.006 m^3)\nVolume above water = -0.004 m^3\n\nWait, we got the same answer as before! What's going on?\n\nThe problem is that we made another assumption in Step 7 that turned out to be incorrect. We assumed that the entire weight of the object was supported by the water, and that the weight of the water displaced was equal to the weight of the object. However, this assumption is not correct, because the object is floating. This means that the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the part of the object that is submerged, which is less than the weight of the entire object.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need to use yet another approach. We know that the weight of the water displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the part of the object that is submerged. We also know that the weight of the water displaced is equal to the weight of the volume of water that is displaced. Therefore, we can find the volume of water that is displaced by dividing the weight of the object by the weight of water per unit volume (which is equal to the density of water), and then use this to find the volume of the part of the object that is above the surface of the water.\n\nStep 9: Find the volume of water displaced by the object\nVolume of water displaced = Weight of object / Density of water\nVolume of water displaced = 6 N / (1000 kg/m^3)\nVolume of water displaced = 0.006 m^3\n\nStep 10: Find the volume of the part of the object that is above the surface of the water\nVolume above water = Total volume of object - Volume of water displaced\nVolume above water = (2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3) - (0.006 m^3)\nVolume above water = -0.004 m^3\n\nWait, we got the same answer again! What's happening?\n\nThe problem is that we made a mistake in Step 9. We used the weight of the object instead of the weight of the part of the object that is submerged. To find the weight of the part of the object that is submerged, we can use the formula:\n\nWeight of submerged part = Volume of submerged part \u00d7 Density of water \u00d7 g\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2).\n\nStep 11: Find the weight of the part of the object that is submerged\nWeight of submerged part = Volume of submerged part \u00d7 Density of water \u00d7 g\nWeight of submerged part = 0.006 m^3 \u00d7 (1000 kg/m^3) \u00d7 9.81 m/s^2\nWeight of submerged part = 0.0589 N\n\nStep 12: Find the volume of water displaced by the object\nVolume of water displaced = Weight of submerged part / Density of water\nVolume of water displaced = 0.0589 N / (1000 kg/m^3)\nVolume of water displaced = 5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 m^3\n\nStep 13: Find the volume of the part of the object that is above the surface of the water\nVolume above water = Total volume of object - Volume of water displaced\nVolume above water = (2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3) - (5.89 \u00d7 10^-5 m^3)\nVolume above water = 0.001941 m^3\n\nStep 14: Find the percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water\nPercentage above water = Volume above water / Total volume of object \u00d7 100%\nPercentage above water = 0.001941 m^3 / (2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3) \u00d7 100%\nPercentage above water = 97.05%\n\nAnswer: (D)",
