            "model_answer": "Step 1: Determine the significance of each segment\n- To determine if a segment requires separate disclosure, it must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n  1. Its reported revenue is 10% or more of the combined revenue of all operating segments.\n  2. The absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10% or more of the greater, in absolute amount, of (a) the combined reported profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss or (b) the combined reported loss of all operating segments that reported a loss.\n  3. Its assets are 10% or more of the combined assets of all operating segments.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the combined totals for each criterion\n- Combined revenue: 42 + 121 + 14 = 177\n- Combined reported profit of non-loss segments: 12 + 65 = 77\n- Combined reported loss of loss segment: 3\n- Combined assets: 470 + 800 + 80 = 1350\n\nStep 3: Apply the criteria to each segment\n- Segment A: \n  - Reported revenue percentage: (42/177) x 100% = 23.7% (meets criterion 1)\n  - Reported profit/loss percentage: (12/77) x 100% = 15.6% (meets criterion 2)\n  - Asset percentage: (470/1350) x 100% = 34.8% (meets criterion 3)\n  - Segment A meets all three criteria\n- Segment B:\n  - Reported revenue percentage: (121/177) x 100% = 68.4% (meets criterion 1)\n  - Reported profit/loss percentage: (65/77) x 100% = 84.4% (meets criterion 2)\n  - Asset percentage: (800/1350) x 100% = 59.3% (meets criterion 3)\n  - Segment B meets all three criteria\n- Segment C:\n  - Reported revenue percentage: (14/177) x 100% = 7.9% (does not meet criterion 1)\n  - Reported profit/loss percentage: (3/77) x 100% = 3.9% (does not meet criterion 2)\n  - Asset percentage: (80/1350) x 100% = 5.9% (does not meet criterion 3)\n  - Segment C does not meet any of the criteria\n\nStep 4: Determine which segments require separate disclosure\n- Segments A and B both meet all three criteria, so they are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's financial statements.\n- Segment C does not meet any of the criteria, so it is not required to be separately disclosed.\n\nAnswer: (A) A and B only.",

Quality control policies and procedures are put in place to ensure that the firm's audits are conducted in accordance with professional standards and regulatory requirements. \n\nOption (A) - Acceptance of a client relationship - is a key element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures. Before accepting a new client, the firm must perform certain procedures to ensure that the client is a good fit for the firm and that the firm has the necessary resources and expertise to perform the audit.\n\nOption (B) - Professional skepticism of management - is also an important element of a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures. Auditors must maintain a skeptical attitude towards management's assertions and be alert for any indications of fraud or other irregularities.\n\nOption (C) - Computer information processing - is not directly related to a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice. While technology is certainly an important aspect of modern auditing, it is not a specific element of quality control policies and procedures.\n\nOption (D) - Efficiency of organizational structures - is also not directly related to a CPA firm's quality control policies and procedures applicable to the firm's auditing practice.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Calculate the compensating balance\nThe compensating balance is 15% of the total credit line, which is $500,000. Therefore, the compensating balance is $75,000.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the commitment fee\nThe commitment fee is 1% of the unused amount of the credit line. Since the firm is borrowing $200,000, the unused amount is $300,000. Therefore, the commitment fee is $3,000.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the interest expense\nThe interest rate is 10%, and the firm is borrowing $200,000 for one year. Therefore, the interest expense is $20,000.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the effective annual interest cost\nThe effective annual interest cost takes into account the interest expense, the compensating balance, and the commitment fee. It is calculated as follows:\n\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = (Interest Expense + Commitment Fee) / (Amount Borrowed - Compensating Balance)\n\nPlugging in the numbers, we get:\n\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = ($20,000 + $3,000) / ($200,000 - $75,000)\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = $23,000 / $125,000\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = 0.184\nEffective Annual Interest Cost = 18.4%\n\nStep 5: Round to the nearest tenth\nThe effective annual interest cost is 18.4%, which rounded to the nearest tenth is 18.5%.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
