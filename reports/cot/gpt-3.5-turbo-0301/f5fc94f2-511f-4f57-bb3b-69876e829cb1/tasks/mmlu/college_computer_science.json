            "model_answer": "To show that {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} is context-free, we can construct a pushdown automaton that recognizes it. \n\nThe idea is to push the first half of the string onto the stack, and then pop symbols off the stack while matching them against the second half of the string. If the stack is empty at the end of the input, then the string is in the language.\n\nFormally, the pushdown automaton can be defined as follows:\n- The input alphabet is {0, 1}.\n- The stack alphabet is {0, 1, X}, where X is the stack symbol used to mark the top of the stack.\n- The set of states is {q0, q1, q2, q3}, where q0 is the start state and q3 is the only accepting state.\n- The transition function is defined as follows:\n  - \u03b4(q0, \u03b5, \u03b5) = (q1, X)\n  - \u03b4(q1, 0, \u03b5) = (q1, 0X)\n  - \u03b4(q1, 1, \u03b5) = (q1, 1X)\n  - \u03b4(q1, \u03b5, \u03b5) = (q2, \u03b5)\n  - \u03b4(q2, 0, 0) = (q2, \u03b5)\n  - \u03b4(q2, 1, 1) = (q2, \u03b5)\n  - \u03b4(q2, \u03b5, X) = (q3, \u03b5)\n- The initial stack symbol is X.\n\nIntuitively, the pushdown automaton works as follows:\n- In state q0, it pushes X onto the stack to mark the bottom of the stack.\n- In state q1, it reads the input and pushes each symbol onto the stack.\n- When it reaches the end of the input, it transitions to state q2 and starts popping symbols off the stack while matching them against the input symbols.\n- If it successfully matches all the symbols, it transitions to state q3 and accepts the input.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) context-free, but not regular.",
