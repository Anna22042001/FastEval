            "model_answer": "The Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model by Atkinson, Morten, and Sue proposes a series of stages that individuals go through in their identity development. The stages are: pre-encounter, encounter, immersion/emersion, internalization, and integrative awareness. \n\nThe question is asking at which stage individuals begin to question their rejection of all aspects of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture. \n\nThe pre-encounter stage is characterized by a lack of awareness of one's own cultural identity and a preference for the dominant culture. Therefore, it is unlikely that individuals in this stage would be questioning their rejection of the dominant culture. \n\nThe immersion/emersion stage is characterized by a rejection of the dominant culture and a strong identification with one's own culture. Therefore, individuals in this stage would not be questioning their rejection of the dominant culture. \n\nThe internalization stage is characterized by a more balanced view of both the dominant culture and one's own culture. However, individuals in this stage are not necessarily questioning their rejection of the dominant culture. \n\nThe integrative awareness stage is characterized by a synthesis of both the dominant culture and one's own culture. Individuals in this stage are able to appreciate and understand both cultures without rejecting either one. Therefore, it is likely that individuals in this stage would be questioning their previous rejection of the dominant culture and absolute loyalty to their own culture. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) integrative awareness.",

This is because nonparametric tests do not assume a specific distribution of the data, whereas parametric tests assume that the data follows a specific distribution (usually normal). Nonparametric tests are also more robust to outliers and do not require assumptions about the variance of the data. Therefore, if the form of the distribution is not known, nonparametric tests are a safer choice.",
