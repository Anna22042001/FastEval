            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B).\n\nExplanation:\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given time period. It is calculated by adding up consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G), and net exports (NX).\n\nIn this scenario, XYZ Corporation's purchase of an original Matisse painting would fall under investment (I) because it is a purchase of a capital good for the purpose of generating income. Therefore, the purchase would increase GDP by the amount of the purchase.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

This could be due to various reasons such as lack of resources, inefficient production methods, or low demand for goods and services. \n\nOption (A) suggests that the nation has experienced a permanent decrease in its production capacity, which would mean that it is no longer capable of producing at its maximum potential. However, this is not necessarily the case as the question only states that the nation is currently producing at a point inside of its production possibility curve, not that it is incapable of producing at its maximum potential.\n\nOption (B) suggests that the nation has experienced slower than usual technological progress, which could lead to a decrease in productivity and therefore result in producing at a point inside of its production possibility curve.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand how each of the Fed actions listed affects the money supply:\n\n- Raise reserve requirements: This means that banks are required to hold a higher percentage of their deposits as reserves, which reduces the amount of money they can lend out. Therefore, raising reserve requirements decreases the money supply.\n- Lower reserve requirements: This means that banks are required to hold a lower percentage of their deposits as reserves, which increases the amount of money they can lend out. Therefore, lowering reserve requirements increases the money supply.\n- Raise the discount rate: This is the interest rate that the Fed charges banks for borrowing money. If the discount rate is raised, it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money from the Fed, which reduces the amount of money they have available to lend out. Therefore, raising the discount rate decreases the money supply.\n- Lower the discount rate: If the discount rate is lowered, it becomes cheaper for banks to borrow money from the Fed, which increases the amount of money they have available to lend out. Therefore, lowering the discount rate increases the money supply.\n- Sell bonds: When the Fed sells bonds, it takes money out of the economy in exchange for the bonds. Therefore, selling bonds decreases the money supply.\n- Buy bonds: When the Fed buys bonds, it injects money into the economy in exchange for the bonds. Therefore, buying bonds increases the money supply.\n\nNow let's look at each of the answer choices:\n\n(A) Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; sell bonds.\n- Raising reserve requirements decreases the money supply.\n- Lowering the discount rate increases the money supply.\n- Selling bonds decreases the money supply.\n\nThis answer choice contains both actions that increase and decrease the money supply, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(B) Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n- Raising reserve requirements decreases the money supply.\n- Lowering the discount rate increases the money supply.\n- Buying bonds increases the money supply.\n\nThis answer choice contains two actions that increase the money supply and one that decreases it, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(C) Raise reserve requirements; raise the discount rate; sell bonds.\n- Raising reserve requirements decreases the money supply.\n- Raising the discount rate decreases the money supply.\n- Selling bonds decreases the money supply.\n\nThis answer choice contains only actions that decrease the money supply, so it is not the correct answer.\n\n(D) Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n- Lowering reserve requirements increases the money supply.\n- Lowering the discount rate increases the money supply.\n- Buying bonds increases the money supply.\n\nThis answer choice contains only actions that increase the money supply, so it is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

A depression is a more severe and prolonged economic downturn. \n\nOption (C) is correct because a sustained decline in output is one of the defining characteristics of a recession. \n\nOption (D) is partially correct because recessions do occur regularly in capitalist economies, but they are not exclusive to capitalist economies. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).",

Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, while quotas limit the quantity of goods that can be imported. \n\nWhen a tariff is imposed on a foreign good, the price of that good increases, making it less competitive with domestic goods. This can lead to an increase in demand for domestic goods, which can result in higher domestic prices. Therefore, tariffs can result in higher domestic prices. \n\nSimilarly, when a quota is imposed on a foreign good, the quantity of that good available in the domestic market is limited. This can also lead to an increase in demand for domestic goods, which can result in higher domestic prices. Therefore, quotas can also result in higher domestic prices. \n\nIn summary, both tariffs and quotas can affect domestic prices, and in both cases, the effect is to raise them. \n\nThe answer is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The \"crowding-out\" effect refers to the decrease in private sector spending that occurs when the government increases its own spending. This is because the increased government spending leads to higher interest rates, which in turn makes it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. \n\nOption (A) suggests that decreasing interest rates from contractionary fiscal policy would lead to the \"crowding-out\" effect, but this is incorrect. Contractionary fiscal policy involves decreasing government spending and/or increasing taxes, which would actually decrease interest rates and potentially stimulate private sector spending. \n\nOption (B) suggests that increasing interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy would lead to the \"crowding-out\" effect, which is correct. Expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending and/or decreasing taxes, which would increase demand for borrowing and lead to higher interest rates. \n\nOption (C) suggests that increasing interest rates from expansionary monetary policy would lead to the \"crowding-out\" effect, which is also correct. Expansionary monetary policy involves increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending. However, if the increased demand for borrowing leads to higher interest rates, this could offset the intended effects of the monetary policy and lead to the \"crowding-out\" effect. \n\nOption (D) suggests that increasing unemployment rates from expansionary monetary policy would lead to the \"crowding-out\" effect, but this is incorrect. Expansionary monetary policy is intended to stimulate economic growth and decrease unemployment, so it would not lead to the \"crowding-out\" effect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) increasing interest rates from expansionary fiscal policy.",
