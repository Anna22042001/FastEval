            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, we need to define what is meant by \"traits.\" Traits are characteristics or attributes that are relatively stable over time and across situations. Examples of traits include personality traits, such as extraversion or neuroticism, and physical traits, such as height or eye color.\n\nNext, we need to consider the concept of age. Age refers to the number of years a person has lived, and it is often used as a marker of developmental stage. As people age, they typically go through various stages of physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development.\n\nGiven these definitions, we can now answer the question. Do traits change with age? The answer is (B) They change a little. While some traits may be relatively stable over time, research has shown that many traits do change to some extent as people age. For example, personality traits such as neuroticism tend to decrease with age, while traits such as agreeableness tend to increase. Physical traits such as muscle mass and bone density also tend to decline with age. However, it is important to note that these changes are typically gradual and may not be noticeable in the short term.",
