            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Induction heating is a process where a magnetic field is used to generate heat in a material. The magnetic field induces eddy currents in the material, which in turn generate heat due to resistance. Therefore, induction heating can only take place in materials that are conductive. \n\nHowever, the question also asks about the magnetic properties of the material. Magnetic materials can be heated by induction because they are conductive, but non-magnetic materials can also be heated by induction as long as they are conductive. Therefore, the answer is (B) conducting materials which may be either magnetic or non-magnetic materials.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The first step is to find the total charge on the metal surface. This can be done by multiplying the surface charge density by the area of the surface, which is given by \u03c0r^2 where r is the radius of the surface. So, the total charge on the surface is:\n\n20 coulombs/m^2 * \u03c0(1m)^2 = 20\u03c0 coulombs\n\nNext, we need to find the electric field at any point outside the metal surface. Since the metal is a conductor, the electric field inside the metal is zero. Therefore, the electric field just outside the metal surface is given by:\n\nE = \u03c3/\u03b50\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the surface charge density and \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\nE = 20 coulombs/m^2 / (8.85 x 10^-12 F/m) = 2.26 x 10^11 N/C\n\nNow, we can find the electric flux through each face of the cube by multiplying the electric field by the area of the face. Since the cube has 6 faces, the total outward electric displacement normal to the surface of the cube is:\n\n6 * E * (10m)^2 = 6 * 2.26 x 10^11 N/C * 100 m^2 = 1.356 x 10^15 Nm^2/C\n\nFinally, we can simplify this answer by using the fact that the electric displacement is related to the electric flux by D = \u03b50E. Therefore:\n\nD = \u03b50E = 8.85 x 10^-12 F/m * 2.26 x 10^11 N/C = 2.00 x 10^0 C/m^2\n\nThe answer is (C) 10\u03c0 coulombs.",

Electrical stiffness is defined as the ratio of voltage to current in an electrical circuit, just as mechanical stiffness is defined as the ratio of force to displacement in a mechanical system. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 1/C, where C is the electrical capacitance.",
