            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "This question is related to the female reproductive system and the timing of events during the menstrual cycle. \n\nPreovulation refers to the time period before ovulation, when the follicle is developing and maturing. Proliferation refers to the phase of the menstrual cycle when the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is growing and thickening. Menstruation is the shedding of the endometrium if fertilization does not occur. \n\nOvulation is the process of the mature follicle releasing an egg from the ovary. This is the time when the environment for sperm passage is most hospitable, as the egg can be fertilized by sperm in the fallopian tube. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) ovulation.",

By this point, the embryo has gone through some major changes. \n\nOne of the most important changes is the formation of the neural tube, which will eventually become the brain and spinal cord. \n\nThe embryo also has a primitive heart that is starting to beat, and the beginnings of other organs such as the liver and kidneys. \n\nIn terms of size, the embryo is still very small at this point. It is only a few millimeters long. \n\nTo convert millimeters to centimeters, we need to divide by 10. \n\nSo, at 28 days after conception, the embryo is about 0.3 centimeters long. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 3.",

Option (A) is not a valid assumption as sexual orientation cannot be predicted based on the gender of one's parents. Option (B) is also not necessarily true as popularity is influenced by many factors beyond one's family structure. Option (C) is a valid assumption as research has shown that having at least one supportive caregiver is crucial for healthy development in children.

While some religions or cultures may discourage or forbid it, it is not universally prohibited.\n\nOption B, incest, is prohibited in most societies due to the potential for genetic abnormalities in offspring and the violation of social norms regarding familial relationships.\n\nOption C, sex during menstruation, is considered taboo in many cultures due to religious or cultural beliefs about menstrual blood being unclean or impure.\n\nOption D, sex with a non-spouse if the person is married, is also generally prohibited in most societies as it violates the social norm of monogamy and can lead to issues such as infidelity and jealousy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is (B) incest.",
