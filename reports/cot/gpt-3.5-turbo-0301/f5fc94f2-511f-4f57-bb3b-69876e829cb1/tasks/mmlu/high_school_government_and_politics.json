            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D).\n\nExplanation:\n- Option (A) is false. Appellate judges do use the stare decisis principle, which means they follow precedent and previously established legal decisions.\n- Option (B) is false. Appellate trials are not usually jury trials. Instead, they are usually heard by a panel of judges.\n- Option (C) is false. Appellate judges do not usually decide the facts of a case. Instead, they review the legal decisions made by lower courts.\n- Option (D) is true. Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts. This means they examine the legal decisions made by lower courts and determine whether they were made correctly according to the law. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "model_answer": "The Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248 are both related to the organization of the federal government. The Peace Corps is a volunteer program that was established in 1961 and is not related to the organization of the federal government. The Senate Committee on Appropriations is a committee within the legislative branch of the government and is not related to the organization of the executive branch. The Cabinet is a group of advisors to the president, but the president does not select the entire staff for the Cabinet. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) White House Office, as the president is allowed to select the staff for this office under the Reorganization Plan 1 of 1939 and Executive Order 8248.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The Dred Scott decision of 1857 was a Supreme Court ruling that declared African Americans were not citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. This decision was controversial and widely criticized. \n\nTo determine which of the options overturned the Dred Scott decision, we can eliminate choices that do not make sense. \n\nOption (B) Missouri Compromise was a law passed in 1820 that prohibited slavery in certain territories. While this law was important in the lead up to the Civil War, it did not directly overturn the Dred Scott decision. \n\nOption (C) Jim Crow laws were a series of state and local laws that enforced racial segregation and discrimination in the United States. These laws were enacted after the Civil War and were in effect until the mid-1960s. While they were a response to the end of slavery and the Civil War, they did not overturn the Dred Scott decision. \n\nOption (A) Plessy v. Ferguson was a Supreme Court decision in 1896 that upheld racial segregation under the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" While this decision was also controversial and had a significant impact on civil rights in the United States, it did not overturn the Dred Scott decision. \n\nThis leaves us with option (D) Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868 and granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, including African Americans. This amendment directly overturned the Dred Scott decision and was a major step forward for civil rights in the United States. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Option (B) is the correct answer because according to the US Constitution, only the Senate has the power to introduce revenue bills. This is stated in Article I, Section 7, which outlines the legislative process for passing bills. The House of Representatives may still propose and pass bills related to taxation, but they must first be approved by the Senate before becoming law. Option (A) is incorrect because both the House and Senate have the power to issue subpoenas as part of their oversight and investigative functions. Option (C) is incorrect because the House of Representatives is also proportional to population, with each state receiving a number of representatives based on its population. Option (D) is incorrect because while the Senate does allow for unlimited debate through the filibuster, the House of Representatives also has procedures for extended debate, such as the Committee of the Whole.

However, it may not be the primary reason for everyone.\n\nStep 3: Religious beliefs could also be a reason for people to join a political party that aligns with their religious beliefs. However, it may not be the primary reason for everyone.\n\nStep 4: Pressure from employers seems like an unlikely reason for people to join a political party. It is not a common practice for employers to pressure their employees to join a specific political party.\n\nStep 5: Based on the above analysis, the most plausible reason for people to join a political party other than the one to which their parents belong is economic issues.

They can make changes to bills, add amendments, and even block bills from reaching the Senate floor.\n\nOption (C) is also not correct because bills in the Senate do have to go through all committees before reaching the floor, but this doesn't necessarily mean that senators are less concerned about their committee assignments. In fact, it could be argued that senators are more concerned because they have to serve on multiple committees.\n\nOption (D) is not correct because representatives can still influence legislation on the House floor through amendments and other procedural tactics.\n\nThis leaves us with option (A), which is correct. House members can only serve on one committee at a time, so they are more concerned about their committee assignments because it determines the issues they will be working on and the legislation they will be involved in shaping.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",
