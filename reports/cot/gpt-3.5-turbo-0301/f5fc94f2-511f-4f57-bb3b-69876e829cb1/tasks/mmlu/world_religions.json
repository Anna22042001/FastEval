Sri Lakshmi is a Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. \n\nOption (B) Mahavira is one of the most important jina in Jainism.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "1. First, we need to understand who Marduk is. Marduk is a Babylonian god of creation, water, vegetation, judgment, and magic. \n2. Next, we need to analyze the title of the composition, \"I will praise the Lord of wisdom.\" This suggests that the composition is likely to portray Marduk in a positive light. \n3. The word \"praise\" also suggests that Marduk is being celebrated for his qualities or actions. \n4. The composition is not titled \"I will fear the Lord of wisdom\" or \"I will appease the Lord of wisdom,\" which would suggest a more negative portrayal of Marduk. \n5. Based on this analysis, we can eliminate options (B) and (C) as they suggest conflicting qualities for Marduk. \n6. Option (D) is also unlikely as it suggests a more philosophical portrayal of Marduk, which may not be the focus of the composition. \n7. This leaves us with option (A), which suggests a loving and forgiving portrayal of Marduk, which is in line with the title of the composition. \n8.
