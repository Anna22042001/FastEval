The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released. It has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position. In the absence of friction, what is the total mechanical energy of the system?\n\n(A) 0.24 mJ\n(B) 0.38 mJ\n(C) 0.48 mJ\n(D) 0.75 mJ",
            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. At the equilibrium position, the mass has no potential energy but has kinetic energy. At the maximum displacement, the mass has maximum potential energy but zero kinetic energy. Therefore, the total mechanical energy is constant and equal to the initial kinetic energy. \n\nThe initial kinetic energy can be calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. Plugging in the given values, we get KE = 1/2 * 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.00024 J = 0.24 mJ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 0.24 mJ.",

Since the box starts and ends with no kinetic energy, the work done by the force is equal to the initial kinetic energy: W = 5 J.\n\nFinally, we can use the definition of work (W = Fd) to solve for the magnitude of the applied force: F = W/d = 5 J / 5 m = 1 N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 1 N.",

The amount of reflection depends on the difference in the indices of refraction between the two media. When light travels from a medium with a lower index of refraction to a medium with a higher index of refraction, some of it is reflected. When light travels from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a medium with a lower index of refraction, some of it is also reflected.\n\nIn this case, white light is incident on a puddle of water (index of refraction 1.33) and a thin layer of oil (index of refraction 1.5) floats on the surface of the puddle. The oil has a higher index of refraction than the water, so some of the light will be reflected at the oil-water interface.\n\nTo determine the most strongly reflected wavelength, we need to use the equation for the reflection coefficient:\n\nr = (n1 - n2)/(n1 + n2)\n\nwhere r is the reflection coefficient, n1 is the index of refraction of the first medium (water), and n2 is the index of refraction of the second medium (oil).\n\nThe reflection coefficient depends on the wavelength of the light, so we need to calculate it for each of the given wavelengths (500 nm, 550 nm, 600 nm, and 650 nm) to determine which one has the highest value.\n\nUsing the equation above, we get the following reflection coefficients for each wavelength:\n\n- 500 nm: r = (1.33 - 1.5)/(1.33 + 1.5) = -0.074\n- 550 nm: r = (1.33 - 1.5)/(1.33 + 1.5) = -0.074\n- 600 nm: r = (1.33 - 1.5)/(1.33 + 1.5) = -0.074\n- 650 nm: r = (1.33 - 1.5)/(1.33 + 1.5) = -0.074\n\nAs we can see, the reflection coefficient is the same for all wavelengths, so the most strongly reflected wavelength is (A) 500 nm.",

Since the length of the pipe is constant, the change in frequency will be due to the change in speed of sound.\n\nTo find the new frequency, we need to first calculate the new speed of sound. We are told that the speed of sound is 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C. The speed of sound at 20\u00b0C is approximately 343 m/s, so a 3 percent decrease would give us:\n\n343 m/s * 0.97 = 332.71 m/s\n\nNow we can use the formula for the frequency of a resonating pipe:\n\nf = (n * v) / (2 * L)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, n is the harmonic (1 for the fundamental), v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe.\n\nWe know that on the warm day, f = 440 Hz and v = 343 m/s. We also know that the length of the pipe is constant, so we can solve for n:\n\nn = (2 * L * f) / v\n\nn = (2 * L * 440 Hz) / 343 m/s\n\nn = 1.28\n\nSince n must be an integer for a resonating pipe, we can assume that the pipe is actually resonating at the second harmonic (n = 2) on the warm day.\n\nNow we can use the same formula to find the new frequency on the cold day, but with the new speed of sound:\n\nf = (n * v) / (2 * L)\n\nf = (2 * L * 332.71 m/s) / 2L\n\nf = 332.71 Hz\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 414 Hz.",
