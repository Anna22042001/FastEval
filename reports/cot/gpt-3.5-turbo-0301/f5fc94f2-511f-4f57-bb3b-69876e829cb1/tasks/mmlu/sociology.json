Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. Option (B) is incorrect because the statement does not mention anything about self-reported depression being highest amongst men and the relatively affluent. Option (C) is incorrect because the statement does not mention anything about men and women having fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression. Option (D) is incorrect because the statement does not mention anything about men being more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

However, the shared identity and experiences of discrimination may be a new aspect of these communities that has emerged in recent times. Therefore, option (A) could be considered a new form of community.\n\nOption (B) refers to gay villages, which have emerged in certain parts of large cities in recent times. This is a clear example of a new form of community.\n\nOption (C) refers to sociological communities formed by unpopular lecturers. This seems like an unlikely option for a new form of community, as it is not clear how widespread or significant these communities would be. Therefore, option (C) is a possible answer to the question.\n\nOption (D) refers to virtual communities that exist only in cyberspace. This is another clear example of a new form of community.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (C) sociological communities, formed by unpopular lecturers.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the embourgeoisement thesis. \n\nThe embourgeoisement thesis is a sociological theory that suggests that the working class is becoming more like the middle class in terms of values, attitudes, and lifestyles. This theory emerged in the 1950s and 1960s when there was a growing middle class and a decline in traditional working-class jobs.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each option.\n\n(A) capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority - This option is not related to the embourgeoisement thesis. It is more related to the idea of the managerial revolution.\n\n(B) the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life - This option is consistent with the embourgeoisement thesis. It suggests that the working class is becoming more like the middle class.\n\n(C) white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace - This option is not related to the embourgeoisement thesis. It is more related to the idea of technological change in the workplace.\n\n(D) the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes - This option is not related to the embourgeoisement thesis. It suggests a different view of social class.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct option.\n\nThe correct option is (B) the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life.

Drug use has increased in Britain and is no longer limited to a specific subculture.\n\n(B) the most commonly used recreational drug is Ecstasy - This statement is false. According to the latest statistics, cannabis is the most commonly used recreational drug in Britain.\n\n(C) teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys - This statement is false. According to a survey conducted by the NHS, teenage boys are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage girls.\n\n(D) despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare - This statement is false. While it is true that there have been moral panics surrounding drug use in Britain, the use of illegal drugs is not rare. In fact, it is quite common.\n\nStep 2: Based on our analysis, we can see that statement (A) is true, statement (B) is false, statement (C) is false, and statement (D) is false.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, the correct answer is (A) as it is the only true statement among the given options.",

            "model_answer": "First, we need to understand what Sullivan's study was about. The study suggested that there is a certain condition under which men do the most housework. \n\nOption A suggests that men who have rediscovered themselves as 'new men' do the most housework. However, this is not necessarily supported by Sullivan's study. \n\nOption B suggests that men do the most housework when their wives are at home and nag them all the time. This seems unlikely, as nagging is not typically a motivating factor for anyone to do anything. \n\nOption C suggests that men do the most housework when exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented. While this may have some influence, it is not the main condition suggested by Sullivan's study. \n\nOption D suggests that men do the most housework when they are unemployed or both partners work full time. This seems like the most likely condition suggested by Sullivan's study, as it implies that men take on more household responsibilities when there is a greater need for it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D).",

He argued that a person's position in the economy was the most important factor in determining their social class. This position was determined by their access to economic resources, such as property, investments, and skills.
