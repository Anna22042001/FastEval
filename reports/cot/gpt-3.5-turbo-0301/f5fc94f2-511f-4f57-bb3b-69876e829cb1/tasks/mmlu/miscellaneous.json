This means that in one year, a household would watch 52 movies.\n\nAssumption 2: According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 128 million households in the United States. \n\nCalculation: To estimate the total number of movies watched in homes in the United States in one year, we can multiply the number of households by the number of movies watched per household per year. \n\n128 million households x 52 movies per household per year = 6.656 billion movies watched in homes in the United States in one year\n\nAnswer: (C) 20,000,000,000 (rounded to the nearest billion)",

            "model_answer": "Assuming that Americans throw out one ice cube per drink, we can estimate the amount of energy wasted by calculating the energy required to freeze that one ice cube. \n\nThe specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/g\u00b0C, and the freezing point of water is 0\u00b0C. Assuming that the water used to make the ice is at room temperature (about 20\u00b0C), it takes 80 calories (or 334.72 J) to freeze 1 gram of water into ice. \n\nThe average ice cube weighs about 30 grams, so it takes 10,041.6 J to freeze one ice cube. \n\nAccording to a study by the National Coffee Association, the average American drinks 3.1 cups of coffee per day. Assuming that Americans also drink an average of 1.5 cups of other beverages per day (such as water, soda, or juice), and that they throw out one ice cube per drink, that means they waste 4.6 ice cubes per day. \n\nMultiplying 10,041.6 J per ice cube by 4.6 ice cubes per day, and then by 365 days per year, we get a total of 16,503,576 J wasted per year by Americans throwing out unused ice. \n\nConverting this to scientific notation, we get 1.65 x 10^7 J, which is closest to answer choice (A) 6*10^8 J. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A).",

These two planets have a significant difference in size, so they are not the answer. \n\n(B) Venus has a diameter of 12,104 km and Earth has a diameter of 12,742 km. These two planets have very similar diameters, so they could be the answer. \n\n(C) Uranus has a diameter of 50,724 km and Neptune has a diameter of 49,244 km.

These two planets have a significant difference in size, so they are not the answer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is either (B) or (C).
