            "model_answer": "In a competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers who are free to enter and exit the market. This means that no single buyer or seller can influence the price of the good or service being traded. As a result, the market price is determined by the forces of supply and demand.\n\nOne of the benefits of a competitive market is that it leads to the efficient allocation of resources. This is because the market price reflects the marginal cost of production, and therefore signals to producers how much of the good or service to produce. Consumers, on the other hand, are willing to pay the market price because it reflects the marginal benefit they receive from consuming the good or service.\n\nAs a result, in a competitive market, both consumer surplus (the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the market price) and producer surplus (the difference between the market price and the minimum price a producer is willing to accept) are maximized. This leads to the highest total welfare for society.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) the total welfare is maximized.",

What would you expect to occur in the market for daycare services?\n\n(A) The demand for daycare falls, lowering the market price.\n(B) The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n(C) The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n(D) The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.",

            "model_answer": "If parents are given a coupon to subsidize the cost of sending their child to daycare, this would effectively lower the price they pay for daycare. This would increase the demand for daycare services, as more parents would be able to afford it. As a result, the market price for daycare would increase. Therefore, the answer is (B) The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.",

            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (D) A perfectly vertical supply curve.\n\nThe situation described in the question is one where there is only one original signed copy of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. This means that the supply of this book is fixed at one. In economics, a fixed supply is represented by a perfectly vertical supply curve, as the quantity supplied cannot change regardless of the price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) A perfectly vertical supply curve.",

            "model_answer": "The perfectly competitive firm will continue to produce as long as the price is greater than or equal to the minimum average variable cost. This is because if the price is greater than the minimum average variable cost, the firm can at least cover its variable costs and some of its fixed costs. However, if the price falls below the minimum average variable cost, the firm cannot even cover its variable costs and it is better off shutting down. \n\nTherefore, the profit-maximizing decision to shut down is made when the price falls below minimum average variable cost. \n\nThe answer is (C).",

The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 strengthened the Sherman Act by prohibiting certain anti-competitive practices that were not covered by the Sherman Act. The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 amended the Clayton Act to prohibit price discrimination. These three acts are considered landmark antitrust acts.\n\nStep 3: Determine which act is not a landmark antitrust act\nThe Wagner Act, also known as the National Labor Relations Act, is not an antitrust act.
