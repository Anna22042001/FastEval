The Golgi apparatus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells that is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for transport to their final destinations.\n\nStep 2: Option (A) states that the cis face of the Golgi apparatus is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum. This is correct as the Golgi apparatus receives proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum at its cis face.\n\nStep 3: Option (B) states that the Golgi apparatus is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face. This is also correct as the Golgi apparatus packages proteins and lipids into vesicles for transport to their final destinations.\n\nStep 4: Option (C) states that the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are continuous with one another. This is incorrect as the cisternae are not continuous but are instead separated by small vesicles.\n\nStep 5: Option (D) states that glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into the Golgi apparatus lumen.

This is because a nucleosome is a basic unit of DNA packaging in eukaryotes, consisting of a segment of DNA wound in sequence around eight histone protein cores. The DNA is wrapped around the histone octamer in 1.65 turns in a left-handed superhelix. The resulting structure is a compacted and organized structure of DNA that allows for efficient storage and regulation of genetic information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) nucleosome.",
