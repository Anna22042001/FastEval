Now we are going to add a \"youngest\" penguin to the table. Hence, we will take Gwen who has the youngest age, and the only thing we don't know yet is her weight. We know the age of Vincent and Bernard is 5 and 9 respectively, Louis is 7, Gwen is 8, and the height and weight of Louis are known. What is Vincent's height and weight? \n\nWe will denote the names of the other penguins as A*,B*,C* while Louis is the youngest one. \n\nTo answer this problem without touching the table again, let's set a counter variable for each of them, that is to count the total number of penguins with us in a single go. \n\nCounter variable for Louis: \nThe counter variable for Louis has been set to 0.\n\nNow, it is time to calculate the heights and weights of the penguins by counting their variables. \n\nCounter variable for each penguin: \n1. Louis: Counted the age variable which is 7. Total inches in height: Added the remaining height of Louis, which is 50 inches and multiplied it by 2. The answer is 11 inches. \n\nNow it is the turn of the variable for the remaining two penguins. \n\nCounter variable for each penguin: \n1. Vincent: Counted the age variable which is 5. Total inches in height: Added the remaining height of Vincent, which is 80 inches and multiplied it by 2. The answer is 16 inches.\n\n2. Gwen: Counted the age variable which is 8 and used the variable of that penguin to count the weight which is 80 kg. The total",
