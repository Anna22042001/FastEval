            "model_answer": "\"gray\" should be \"grey\" as \"gray\" and \"old\" should not be joined by a comma in the correct sentence. \n\nThe reasonings for the correct order are:\n\n1. In English, adjectives are usually placed before the noun they modify, unless the adjective is one word in length, in which case it is placed after the noun. In the sentence B) midsize old grey Brazilian sweater, \"grey\" is the adverb and should come after \"midsize\", breaking the correct order.\n\n2. In English, \"the\" word is usually used as a conjunction and not as an adjective. In case of doubt, it is better to replace it with \"a\" or \"an\". It is therefore likely that the correct sentence should be: \"midsize old grey Brazilian sweater\".\n\nThe final line can simply be \"a\".",

Mexico is the first word and needs to come before the Latin-based adjective'midsize'. \n2. The adjective 'gray Mexican walking' needs to come after the article 'the' so it takes the position of a post-modifying adjective. Therefore, it is the correct answer which should be'midsize gray Mexican rubber walking cat'.",

            "model_answer": "Let's start with the word'repulsive'. Since the adjective comes before the noun, the correct sentence would be: 'A) repulsive big pink steel exercise shoe'. This is because'repulsive' modifies 'big' which comes before 'pink' which comes before'steel' which comes before 'exercise' and finally'shoe'. \n\nNext, let's handle 'big'. Similarly, since the adjective comes before the noun we can see 'big' modifying a word that has already been modified by'repulsive', so the modified word should be 'big repulsive'. However, 'white' comes after 'pink' and'rectangular' comes after 'exercise' which are modified by 'big' and'small'. This means that'small white rectangular exercise shoe' would be more correct than the other two options. \n\nLooking at 'exercise', now it comes down to 'pink' and'steel'. Since 'pink' comes before'steel', the correct sentence should be: 'A) pink big exercise rectangular steel shoe'. \n\nLastly, let us tackle 'exercise'. Since 'exercise' comes before'shoe' and 'pink' comes before 'big', the correct sentence should be: 'A) pink big exercise rectangular white shoe'. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'A) pink big exercise rectangular white shoe'.",
