            "question": "In their study of depression, Brown & Harris (1978) found that:\n\n(A) women's susceptibility to stress depended on their levels of social support\n(B) self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent\n(C) men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression\n(D) men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the main points in the question.\n\nThe main points in the question are:\n\n1. Women's susceptibility to stress depends on their levels of social support.\n2. Self-reported depression is highest amongst men and the relatively affluent.\n3. Men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression.\n4. Men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles.\n\nStep 2: Apply the given information to the question.\n\nThe given information can be applied to the question by considering the possible reasons why men may be more vulnerable to depression. One possible reason is that men may be less likely to seek help from others due to cultural expectations of stoicism. Additionally, men may face more pressure in their daily lives and may be less likely to acknowledge their problems. These factors may contribute to higher levels of depression among men.\n\nStep 3: Determine the best answer.\n\nThe best answer is (D) men are more vulnerable to depression because of conventional gender roles. This is because the question specifically asks about the vulnerability of men to depression, and the given information supports this claim.",

The next step is to break down the thesis into smaller statements. The thesis is divided into three parts: \"capitalists are being replaced\", \"the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life\", and \"white collar occupations are being 'deskilled'\".\n3. Now, we need to analyze each statement. The first statement is \"capitalists are being replaced\". We can break this down into smaller statements: \"capitalists are being replaced by salaried managers with bureaucratic authority\" and \"capitalists are being replaced by new technologies\".\n4. The second statement is \"the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life\". We can break this down into smaller statements: \"the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life\" and \"the affluent working class is adopting new technologies\".\n5. The final statement is \"white collar occupations are being 'deskilled'\". We can break this down into smaller statements: \"white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by new technologies\" and \"white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies\".\n6. Now, we can combine the statements to form a single thesis: \"the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life and white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by new technologies\".\n\nThe final answer is \"D\".",

            "correct_answer": 0,

They are usually planned and structured, and the outcome is the most important thing. Examples include business decisions and political campaigns.\n\n2. Value-rational actions are those that are done to uphold or promote a set of values or beliefs. They are usually done for the greater good, and the outcome is seen as a success if the values are upheld. Examples include charity work and volunteering.\n\n3. Traditional actions are those that are done because they have been done before, and are usually done for cultural or historical reasons. They are usually done for the sake of tradition, and the outcome is not as important as the process. Examples include religious practices and family traditions.\n\n4. Affectual actions are those that are done for personal satisfaction or enjoyment. They are usually done for the sake of the activity itself, and the outcome is not as important as the process. Examples include hobbies and recreational activities.\n\n5. Infected actions are those that are done because of a contagious disease or infection. They are usually done to prevent the spread of the disease, and the outcome is seen as a success if the disease is contained. Examples include vaccinations and disease control.\n\nThe answer is 'D'.",

This is because the subculture often involves drug use as a way to enhance the experience.\n\n2. B) Ecstasy is the most commonly used recreational drug in Britain. This is likely due to its popularity in the club scene and its reputation as a \"club drug.\"\n\n3. C) Teenage girls are more likely to experiment with hard drugs than teenage boys. This is likely due to the fact that girls are often pressured to conform to more traditional gender roles and may be less likely to engage in drug use.\n\n4. D) Despite a series of moral panics, the use of illegal drugs is very rare. This is likely due to the fact that drug use is generally discouraged and illegal drugs are often associated with negative consequences.",

This is because 'new men' are typically more independent and less traditional in their roles, which may lead to them doing more housework.\n3. The study did not mention anything about the wife nagging them, so we can safely assume that it was not a factor.\n4. The invention of exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were not mentioned in the study, so we can safely assume that they were not a factor.\n5.

We can reason that exploitation is a result of the power imbalance between the working class and the capitalist class.\n\n2. Next, we can consider the second definition, (B). Weber argues that a social group's consciousness of their status and life chances is a class situation. We can reason that this is because the working class is often unaware of their own status and the power dynamics between them and the capitalist class.\n\n3. For the third definition, (C), we can consider the position in the capital, product and labour markets. We can reason that the working class is often in a position of economic disadvantage, as they are the ones producing the wealth while the capitalist class owns the means of production.\n\n4. Finally, for the last definition, (D), we can consider the lifestyle of a social class, as defined by patterns of consumption. We can reason that the working class often has a lifestyle based on consumption of goods and services that are out of their reach due to their economic status.\n\n5. After considering these definitions, we can conclude that the working class is often in a class situation due to the power imbalance between them and the capitalist class.
