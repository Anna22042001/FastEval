            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes is reduced by approximately 50% in obese individuals after bariatric surgery. The reasoning behind this is that the surgery reduces the size of the stomach, which in turn reduces the amount of food consumed. As a result, the body's insulin sensitivity improves, leading to a decrease in blood glucose levels. This reduction in blood glucose levels is the primary mechanism by which bariatric surgery reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes.",

Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations",

            "model_answer": "The correct statement is (B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. The reasoning step-by-step is as follows:\n\n1. Replace saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids: This statement is true because monounsaturated fatty acids contain one double bond and have a structure that is more flexible than saturated fatty acids, which have two double bonds and a more rigid structure.\n\n2. Replace saturated fatty acids with plant stanols/sterols: This statement is false because plant stanols/sterols are not found in animal products and are not affected by the consumption of saturated fatty acids.\n\n3. Replace saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate: This statement is also false because consuming large amounts of carbohydrates does not necessarily lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol.\n\n4. Replace saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids: This statement is true because replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids can lead to a decrease in LDL cholesterol.",
