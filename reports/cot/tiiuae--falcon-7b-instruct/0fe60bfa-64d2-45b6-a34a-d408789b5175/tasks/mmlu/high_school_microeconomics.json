Consumer surplus is the difference between the amount consumers pay for a product and the amount producers receive from selling it.\n3. Producer surplus is the difference between the amount producers receive from selling a product and the amount consumers pay for it.\n4. The difference between consumer and producer surplus is the total welfare.\n5. The outcome is maximized when the difference between consumer and producer surplus is maximized.\n\nThe answer is (D).

            "question": "Suppose the county government sends each parent a coupon that can be used to subsidize the cost of sending each child to daycare. What would you expect to occur in the market for daycare services?\n\n(A) The demand for daycare falls, lowering the market price.\n(B) The demand for daycare rises, increasing the market price.\n(C) The supply of daycare rises, lowering the market price.\n(D) The supply of daycare falls, increasing the market price.",
            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The final answer is (B). The reasoning behind this is that if the government provides a coupon to parents, it will likely lead to a decrease in the demand for daycare services. This is because parents will be more likely to send their children to daycare if the cost is subsidized. As a result, the supply of daycare services will increase, and the market price will rise.",

This is similar to a downward sloping demand curve. The signed copy is also unique and cannot be replaced. This is similar to an upward sloping supply curve. The copy is also unique and cannot be replaced. This is similar to an invisible hand. Therefore, the answer is B. An upward sloping supply curve.",

The substitution effect is the change in the quantity demanded due to a change in the availability of a substitute product.\n\nStep 2: Apply the concepts.\nThe price of the good has decreased, so the quantity demanded has likely decreased as well. The substitution effect is stronger than the income effect, so the substitution effect is likely to be the main reason for the decrease in quantity demanded.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer.\nThe answer is \"B.\" The income effect is stronger than the substitution effect, so the quantity demanded is likely to decrease more due to the price decrease.",
