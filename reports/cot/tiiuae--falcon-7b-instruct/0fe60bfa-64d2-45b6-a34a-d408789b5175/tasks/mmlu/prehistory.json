This is evidenced by the presence of ice-sculpted landscapes and the presence of ice-age fossils. The reason for the retreat of glaciers between 10,900 and 9,000 years ago is due to a decrease in global temperatures. This is supported by the presence of tree-ring data that indicates a cooling trend during this time. The final letter is 'D'.",
