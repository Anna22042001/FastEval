            "model_answer": "The United States is the LEAST self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry. The reasoning behind this is that the US has a large amount of natural resources, but it is not self-sufficient in many of the resources needed for modern industry. For example, the US is heavily dependent on foreign oil for its energy needs. In contrast, Japan and France are more self-sufficient in their natural resources.",

            "question": "When a new fashion design is introduced globally, the information initially travels through a process known as\n\n(A) contagious diffusion\n(B) relocation diffusion\n(C) innovative diffusion\n(D) hierarchical diffusion",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The process of information diffusion can be broken down into four main stages:\n\n1. Contagious diffusion: This is when a new idea or fashion spreads from person to person in a short period of time. This is often due to the novelty of the idea, which causes people to want to share it with others.\n\n2. Relocation diffusion: This is when a new idea or fashion is introduced to a new geographic location. This can be due to the migration of people, or due to the spread of information through trade and communication.\n\n3. Innovative diffusion: This is when a new idea or fashion is introduced to a new market segment. This can be due to the introduction of a new product category, or due to the introduction of a new technology.\n\n4. Hierarchical diffusion: This is when a new idea or fashion is introduced to a new market segment. This can be due to the introduction of a new product category, or due to the introduction of a new technology.\n\nThe final answer is (D) hierarchical diffusion. This is because the diffusion process is hierarchical, meaning that the diffusion of information starts at the top and works its way down to the bottom.",
