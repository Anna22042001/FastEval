            "model_answer": "1. The reason for the Sun's gravitational pull is due to its immense mass.\n2. Light is affected by gravity, so it is slowed down when it approaches the Sun.\n3. Light is also deflected when it passes the Sun, as the Sun's immense mass curves the path of light.\n4. The clock on the Sun's surface runs faster due to the time dilation effect caused by the Sun's immense mass.\n\nThe final answer is (D).",
