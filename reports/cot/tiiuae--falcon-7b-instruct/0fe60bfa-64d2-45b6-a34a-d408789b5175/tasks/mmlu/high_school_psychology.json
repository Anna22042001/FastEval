Once she recognizes that it is her friends throwing a surprise party, rather than ninjas, her heart continues to race, but she experiences happiness. Which theory of emotions best explains this fact?\n\n(A) Cannon-Bard\n(B) Schachter-Singer\n(C) James-Lange\n(D) Erikson-Balint",

The reason is that it is the center of the endocrine system, which controls hormones that play a role in appetite and food intake. The hypothalamus is also involved in regulating thirst and body temperature, which are related to food intake. The somatosensory cortex is involved in the sense of taste and touch, which are important in the process of eating. The medulla oblongata is involved in the basic physiological functions of breathing and swallowing. The occipital lobes are involved in vision, which is not directly related to eating.
