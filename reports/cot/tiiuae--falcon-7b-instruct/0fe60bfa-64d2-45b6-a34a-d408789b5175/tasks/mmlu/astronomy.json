How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The final answer is (B). The reasoning step-by-step is as follows:\n\n1. The angular resolution of the human eye is about 1 arcsecond, which means that the smallest angle that can be resolved is about 1/60th of a degree.\n2. The angular separation between two stars is smaller than this resolution, so the stars will not be visible.\n3. Therefore, the stars will appear as a single point of light.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The atmosphere of Saturn and Jupiter are similar in many ways, but there are a few differences. One of the main differences is the composition of their atmospheres. Saturn's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, while Jupiter's atmosphere contains a significant amount of other compounds, such as methane and ammonia. This difference in composition means that the two planets have different types of clouds and different weather patterns.\n\nThe presence of belts, zones, and storms on both planets is similar, but the severity and frequency of these features are different. Saturn has a more active weather system with more intense storms and more prominent cloud features than Jupiter. The difference in wind speed is also significant, with Saturn's equatorial wind speed being more than 900 miles per hour, while Jupiter's is only about 250 miles per hour.\n\nThe final difference between the two planets is the composition of their atmospheres. While both contain hydrogen and helium, the ratio of these elements is different. Saturn's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen, while Jupiter's atmosphere contains a significant amount of other compounds, such as methane and ammonia. This difference in composition means that the two planets have different types of clouds and different weather patterns.",
