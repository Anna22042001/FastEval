The muscle fibre relaxes when the nerve stimulus is too forceful because the actin binding sites are being activated too much, causing the muscle to contract.\n3. The muscle fibre relaxes when the actin binding sites are uncovered because the muscle is no longer being held together by the actin filaments.\n4. The muscle fibre relaxes when the actin binding sites are saturated because the muscle is being held together by the actin filaments and cannot contract any further.\n\nThe final answer is (A) the nerve stimulus is removed.",

The reasoning behind this is that dopamine and acetyl choline are both neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of fatigue. Acetyl choline is involved in the transmission of signals between neurons, while dopamine is involved in the regulation of motivation and alertness. Therefore, the combination of these two neurotransmitters is likely to have an effect on fatigue.",
