            "correct_answer": 0,

This can lead to buffer overflow if the input string is larger than the allocated memory.\n\nString boundary checks are important to ensure that the input string does not exceed the allocated memory. Without these checks, the program can potentially run out of memory and cause a buffer overflow.\n\nTherefore, the reason why apps developed in languages like C and C++ are prone to buffer overflow is due to the lack of string boundary checks in predefined functions.",
