            "model_answer": "The most common cystic fibrosis mutation consists of a deletion.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. A deletion is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis.\n2. A deletion is a missing piece of DNA.\n3. The most common deletion in cystic fibrosis is a deletion of the CFTR gene.\n4. The CFTR gene is responsible for producing a protein that regulates the transport of salt and water in and out of cells.\n5. A deletion of this gene results in the production of a defective protein, leading to the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n6. The most common deletion in cystic fibrosis is a deletion of the CFTR gene.\n7. The deletion of this gene is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis.\n8. The final line should contain the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else.\n9. The answer is 'D'.\nUser",

An increase in the inbreeding coefficient, F, is likely to result in:\n(A) reduced likelihood of heterozygotes being present in a population\n\nReasoning:\nThe higher the inbreeding coefficient, the more likely it is that there will be a decrease in the frequency of heterozygotes in the population. This is because heterozygotes are more likely to be eliminated from the population due to random chance events, such as genetic drift. Therefore, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient will lead to a decrease in the frequency of heterozygotes, which in turn will lead to a higher proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\n2. (B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage\n\nReasoning:\nThe higher the inbreeding coefficient, the more likely it is that there will be a higher proportion of genes that show linkage. This is because linkage is more likely to occur between genes that are more closely related to each other, as the distance between genes increases with inbreeding. Therefore, an increase in the inbreeding coefficient will lead to a higher proportion of genes that show linkage.\n\n3. (C) higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells\n\nReasoning:\nThe higher the inbreeding coefficient, the more likely it is that there will be a higher level of difference between RNA molecules in two daughter cells.
