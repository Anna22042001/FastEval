            "model_answer": "The enlightened self-interest model of CSR is a concept that suggests that an organization should prioritize its own interests over those of its stakeholders. This model is based on the idea that an organization's success is ultimately dependent on its own ethical behavior and actions. The reasoning behind this model is that an organization that acts in an ethical manner will be more likely to succeed in the long run, as it will be able to maintain a positive relationship with its stakeholders. This will also lead to increased customer loyalty and improved brand reputation.",
