Glutamine is a common amino acid found in muscle cells.\n\n3. Glutamine is a precursor of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n\n4. GABA is known to have a pH-dependent effect on the extracellular environment.\n\n5. Therefore, it is possible that the intracellular buffer formed by glutamine could help limit pH changes during high glycolysis rates.\n\n6. Glutamine is also involved in the synthesis of creatine, which is important for muscle energy production.\n\n7. Therefore, it is possible that the intracellular buffer formed by glutamine could help limit pH changes during high glycolysis rates by providing creatine for energy production.\n\n8. As a result, the intracellular buffer formed by glutamine could help limit pH changes during high glycolysis rates.\n\n9.
