D: Short memory\n\nExplanation:\n\nAdaptive immunity is a complex system that allows the body to recognize and defend against foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria. The speed of response to a foreign protein is an important aspect of adaptive immunity. The ability to distinguish self and non-self is also important, as the immune system needs to be able to distinguish between foreign and self-antigens. Additionally, the ability to distinguish between viruses and bacteria is crucial, as the immune system needs to be able to distinguish between these two types of pathogens. Finally, short memory is important for the immune system to be able to quickly recognize and respond to pathogens without taking too much time to do so.",

            "model_answer": "1. Vaccines are a key way to prevent diseases. They work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against a specific pathogen. This can provide long-term protection against the disease.\n\n2. Antivirals are medications that target specific viruses to prevent them from replicating and causing disease. They can be used to treat existing infections and prevent future ones.\n\n3. Hygiene is the practice of maintaining cleanliness and good personal habits to prevent the spread of disease. Washing hands regularly, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and keeping your living space clean can all help reduce the risk of infection.\n\n4. Mosquito nets are used to prevent mosquito bites, which can transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. They are especially important in areas where these diseases are prevalent.\n\n5.
