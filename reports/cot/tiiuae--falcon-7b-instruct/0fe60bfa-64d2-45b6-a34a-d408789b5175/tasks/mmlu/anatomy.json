            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The muscles normally active during quiet inspiration are the external and internal intercostal muscles. The reason is that quiet inspiration is a deep breathing technique that involves the inhalation of air through the nose and the activation of the diaphragm muscle. The diaphragm muscle is connected to the external and internal intercostal muscles, which are responsible for breathing in and out. Therefore, these muscles are the ones that are typically active during quiet inspiration.",

It is connected to the olfactory epithelium, which is located in the nasal cavity. The olfactory epithelium is responsible for the detection of odorants in the air. The olfactory nerve is connected to the brain via the olfactory tract, which is located in the limbic system. The limbic system is responsible for processing sensory information and integrating it with emotions and memories. Therefore, the olfactory nerve is responsible for the sense of smell.",

The spermatozoon then travels through the fallopian tubes and into the uterus where it can fertilize the egg.
