All four ligands in a tetrahedral complex are the same, so there is no difference in optical isomerism.\n2. In a linear complex, the two ligands are different, so there is a difference in optical isomerism.\n3. In an octahedral complex, the three ligands are different, so there is a difference in optical isomerism.\n4.
