This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23\n3. This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23 - 23\n4. This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23 - 23 - 23\n5. This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23 - 23 - 23\n6. This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23 - 23 - 23\n7. This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23 - 23 - 23\n8. This simplifies to 14 = w - 23 - 23 - 23 - 23\n9.
