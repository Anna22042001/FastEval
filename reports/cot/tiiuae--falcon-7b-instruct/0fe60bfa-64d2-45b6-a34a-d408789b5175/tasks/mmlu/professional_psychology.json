            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the main topic of the question. In this case, it is \"American Psychological Association\".\n\nStep 2: Determine the subtopic of the question. In this case, it is \"non-White research participants\".\n\nStep 3: Consider the different categories that might be included in the subtopic. In this case, it could be people with a physical disability, the elderly, or clients with a chronic disease.\n\nStep 4: Weigh the evidence for each category. While the APA does have a diverse membership, it is primarily composed of White individuals. Therefore, it is more likely that the APA does not have a significant number of non-White research participants.\n\nStep 5: Eliminate the less plausible options. Based on the information given, the elderly and clients with a chronic disease are less likely to be members of the APA.\n\nStep 6: Consider the remaining option, which is the clients with a physical disability. While the APA does have members with physical disabilities, it is still a minority group.\n\nStep 7: Weigh the evidence for the clients with a physical disability. While the APA does have members with physical disabilities, it is still a minority group.\n\nStep 8: Based on the reasoning, the answer is (B) the elderly.",

Dissonance: When individuals encounter cultural practices that are different from their own, they may experience cognitive dissonance.\n\n3. Integrative Awareness: As individuals gain more knowledge and experience, they may become more open to other cultures and their own.\n\n4. Introspection: Atkinson et al. suggest that individuals may also become introspective and reflect on their own cultural identity.\n\nThe final answer is (D) integrative awareness.",
