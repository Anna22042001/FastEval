The work done by F on a particle is given by the formula W = Fx + mv, where W is the work done, F is the force applied, x is the displacement of the particle in the x-direction, and m is the mass of the particle. In this case, the displacement of the particle is (t, t^2, t^3), and the force applied is F = -1/4. Therefore, the work done by F on the particle is W = -1/4 + mv = -1/4 + mv = -1/4v.",

            "model_answer": "The answer is A) x^2 + y^2 = 1. The reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The parabola is given as x^2 = y + 4.\n2. To find the circles that intersect with the parabola, we can use the quadratic formula: x^2 = (y + 4)^2.\n3. Simplifying this equation, we get x^2 = (y + 4)(y + 4).\n4. Now, we can use the fact that the sum of two squares is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares.\n5. So, we can write the equation as x^2 = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y + 4)(y + 4) = (y",
