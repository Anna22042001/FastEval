We know that:\n- It takes 1 hour to get from the library to the airport (Susan saw him at the library from 6am to 9am, and Linda saw him at the airport from 9am to 3pm)\n- It takes 1 hour to get from the airport to the tennis court (Linda saw him at the airport from 9am to 3pm, and Mark saw him playing tennis from 4pm to 6pm)\n- It takes 1 hour to get from the tennis court to the office (Mark saw him playing tennis from 4pm to 6pm, and Samantha saw him working at the office from 6pm to 9pm)\n- It takes 1 hour to get from the office to the gym (Samantha saw him working at the office from 6pm to 9pm, and Ashley saw him working out at the gym from 9pm to 10pm)\n- It takes 1 hour to get from the gym to the coffee shop (Ashley saw him working out at the gym from 9pm to 10pm, and the coffee shop was closed after 10pm)\n\nSo, we can add up the travel times to get the total time it takes for William to get from one place to another:\n- 1 hour to get from the library to the airport + 1 hour to get from the airport to the tennis court + 1 hour to get from the tennis court to the office + 1 hour to get from the office to the gym + 1 hour to get from the gym to the coffee shop = 5 hours\n\nNow, we know that the coffee shop was closed after 10pm, so we can subtract 5 hours from 10pm to get the earliest time that William could have gone to the coffee shop:\n- 10pm - 5 hours = 5pm\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 6pm to 9pm.",
