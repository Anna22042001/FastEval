The second step is to calculate the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old. We can do this by subtracting the number of penguins that are 5 years old or younger from the total number of penguins. There are 3 penguins that are 5 years old or younger, so the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old is 5 - 3 = 2.\n\n3.
