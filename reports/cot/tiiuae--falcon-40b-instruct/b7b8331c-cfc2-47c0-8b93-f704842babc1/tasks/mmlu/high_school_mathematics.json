            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the geometry of the rectangle. The rectangle is a quadrilateral with vertices $(0,0)$, $(3,0)$, $(3,2)$, and $(0,2)$. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is $A = bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b = 3$ and $h = 2$, so $A = 3 * 2 = 6$. Therefore, the probability of picking a point from inside the rectangle is $1 - \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNext, we need to understand the probability of picking a point where $x < y$. We can use the fact that the probability of picking a point from the first quadrant is $\\frac{1}{2}$, since the rectangle is divided into four quadrants by the lines $y = x$ and $y = -x$. Therefore, the probability of picking a point where $x < y$ is $\\frac{1}{2} * \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nFinally, we can output the answer as a single letter with parenthesis without anything else. The answer is (D) $\\frac{1}{3}$.",

In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the current population. This means that if the population doubles every 10 hours, then after 1 day, the population will have doubled 6 times, resulting in a total of 64 times the initial population. Therefore, the approximate number of bacteria after 1 full day is (200*2^6) = 64*200 = 12800. Therefore, the answer is (D) 2793.",
