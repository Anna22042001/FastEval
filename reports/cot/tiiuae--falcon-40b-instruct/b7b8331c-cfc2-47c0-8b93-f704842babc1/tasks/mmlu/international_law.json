            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The 'living instrument principle' is a principle used by the European Court of Human Rights to interpret the European Convention on Human Rights. It states that the Convention should be interpreted in a way that takes into account the changing circumstances of the world. This means that the Court can interpret the Convention in a way that goes beyond the literal meaning of the text, in order to ensure that it remains relevant and effective in protecting human rights.\n\nIn the case of Golder v UK (1978), the Court held that the Convention did not require the UK to provide free legal aid to prisoners who wished to challenge their convictions. This decision was based on the literal meaning of the text of the Convention, which did not explicitly require the provision of free legal aid. However, the Court later changed its interpretation of the Convention in the case of A v UK (2009), which held that the Convention did require the UK to provide free legal aid to prisoners who wished to challenge their convictions. This decision was based on the Court's interpretation of the Convention in light of changing circumstances, including the development of international human rights law and the importance of access to justice.\n\nIn the case of Goodwin v UK (2002), the Court held that the UK's law on the detention of asylum seekers was incompatible with the Convention. This decision was based on the Court's interpretation of the Convention in light of changing circumstances, including the development of international human rights law and the importance of protecting the rights of asylum seekers.\n\nIn the case of Osman v UK (1998), the Court held that the UK's law on the detention of suspected terrorists was incompatible with the Convention. This decision was based on the Court's interpretation of the Convention in light of changing circumstances, including the development of international human rights law and the importance of protecting the rights of suspected terrorists.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Osman v UK (1998).",
