            "model_answer": "Please provide your reasoning for each step.\n\n1. The mass is displaced 0.030 m from its equilibrium position and released.\n\n2. The mass has a speed of 0.040 m/s as it passes through its equilibrium position.\n\n3. In the absence of friction, the total mechanical energy of the system is equal to the kinetic energy of the mass plus the potential energy of the spring.\n\n4. The kinetic energy of the mass is given by 0.5 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the mass and v is its speed.\n\n5. The potential energy of the spring is given by 0.5 * k * x^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position.\n\n6. Substituting the values into the equation, we get:\n\n0.5 * 0.30 * 0.040^2 + 0.5 * 0.30 * 0.030^2 = 0.24 mJ\n\n7. Therefore, the total mechanical energy of the system is 0.24 mJ.\n\n8.

            "question": "A 10 kg box slides horizontally without friction at a speed of 1 m/s. At one point, a constant force is applied to the box in the direction of its motion. The box travels 5 m with the constant force applied. The force is then removed, leaving the box with a speed of 2 m/s.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use the formula for work done by a constant force. Work done by a constant force is equal to the product of the force and the distance traveled. In this case, the box traveled 5 meters with the constant force applied, so the work done by the force is 5 joules. We know that the box started with a speed of 1 m/s and ended with a speed of 2 m/s, so the change in speed is 1 m/s. We can use the formula for work done by a constant force to solve for the force: work done = force x distance = 5 joules = (mass x acceleration) x distance. We know that the mass of the box is 10 kg, so the acceleration is 1 m/s^2. Therefore, the force applied to the box is 10 kg x 1 m/s^2 = 10 N. The answer is (B) 2 N.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of refraction and reflection of light. When light travels from one medium to another, it changes its speed and direction due to the difference in the indices of refraction of the two media. This is known as refraction. When light strikes a surface, some of it is reflected and some of it is transmitted. The amount of light that is reflected depends on the angle of incidence and the indices of refraction of the two media. In this case, the oil layer has a higher index of refraction than the water, so some of the light that strikes the oil layer is reflected back into the water. The amount of light that is reflected depends on the angle of incidence and the indices of refraction of the two media. The most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that is closest to the critical angle for the oil layer, which is approximately 550 nm. Therefore, the answer is (B).",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The speed of sound is directly proportional to the temperature of the medium through which it is traveling. Therefore, if the temperature is lower, the speed of sound will also be lower. In this case, the speed of sound is 3% lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C. To find the new frequency of the pipe, we need to use the formula for the frequency of a pipe open at both ends: f = (v/2L) / (2\u03c0), where f is the frequency, v is the speed of sound, L is the length of the pipe, and \u03c0 is a constant. We know that the speed of sound is 3% lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C, so v = 0.97v0, where v0 is the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C. Plugging this into the formula, we get f = (0.97v0/2L) / (2\u03c0), where L is the length of the pipe. We know that the length of the pipe is 2L = 2(L/2) = L, so we can simplify the formula to f = (0.97v0/2L) / (2\u03c0). Now we need to solve for L. We know that the frequency of the pipe is 440 Hz, so we can set up the equation f = 440 Hz. Solving for L, we get L = (2\u03c0 * 440 Hz) / (0.97v0/2). Plugging in the values, we get L = (2\u03c0 * 440 Hz) / (0.97 * 343.2 m/s / 2) = 0.0025 m. Therefore, the length of the pipe is 0.0025 m. Plugging this into the formula for the frequency of the pipe, we get f = (0.97v0/2L) / (2\u03c0), where v0 is the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C. Plugging in the values, we get f = (343.2 m/s/2) / (2\u03c0) = 414 Hz. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).",
