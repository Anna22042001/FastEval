            "correct_answer": 3,

This means that the inhibitor binds to the enzyme at a different location than the substrate, and prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme. This type of inhibition is reversible, meaning that the inhibitor can be removed from the enzyme and the enzyme can resume its normal function.",

            "model_answer": "Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (C). \n\nExplanation:\n\nInjecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would not be expected to block in vitro fertilization because the antibodies would bind to the ZP3 on the egg, not the ZP3 on the sperm. Therefore, the sperm would still be able to bind to the ZP3 on the egg and initiate the acrosomal reaction. \n\nExplanation:\n\nIncubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs would not be expected to block in vitro fertilization because the sperm would still be able to bind to the ZP3 on the egg and initiate the acrosomal reaction. \n\nExplanation:\n\nIncubating eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 would not be expected to block in vitro fertilization because the antibodies would bind to the ZP3 on the egg, not the ZP3 on the sperm.
