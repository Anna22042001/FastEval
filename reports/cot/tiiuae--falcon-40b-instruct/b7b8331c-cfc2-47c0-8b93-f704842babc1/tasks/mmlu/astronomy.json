            "model_answer": "The answer is (C). Earth has a partially molten metallic core, which generates a magnetic field. The core is also rotating, which helps to maintain the magnetic field. Additionally, Earth's rotation is relatively fast, which also contributes to the strength of the magnetic field.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the composition of the solar nebula. The solar nebula was a cloud of gas and dust that formed the solar system. It is believed that the nebula was composed of about 70% hydrogen, 26% helium, and 4% other elements. The hydrogen and helium were the most abundant elements in the nebula, while the other elements were present in much smaller quantities.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate answer choices (A) and (D) as they do not follow the order of abundance of the elements in the nebula.\n\nNext, we need to consider the order of the remaining elements. Metals are heavier than rocks, so they would be expected to be present in smaller quantities in the nebula. Therefore, we can eliminate answer choice (C) as it places metals before rocks.\n\nThis leaves us with answer choice (B) as the correct answer. It lists the elements in the order of their abundance in the solar nebula, from highest to lowest percentage of mass.",
