            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of two's complement and how it works. Two's complement is a way of representing negative numbers in binary. It works by adding 1 to the binary representation of the number and then flipping all the bits. For example, the two's complement of -5 in binary is 11111111, which is the same as the binary representation of 31. \n\nNow, let's look at the pairs of numbers given in the question. \n\nPair (A): 11111111 + 00000001 = 11111110 (two's complement of -1)\nPair (B): 00000001 + 10000000 = 10000001 (two's complement of -1)\nPair (C): 11111111 + 10000001 = 11111110 (two's complement of -1)\nPair (D): 10000001 + 10101010 = 10101011 (two's complement of -1)\n\nIn all four pairs, the result of adding the two numbers is a two's complement representation of a negative number. Therefore, the answer to the question is (D).",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of stack-based storage allocation and static allocation. \n\nStack-based storage allocation is a method of memory allocation where data is stored in a stack data structure. The stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure, which means that the last item added to the stack is the first item to be removed. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created, which contains the local variables and function call stack. When the function returns, the stack frame is popped off the stack, and the program continues executing from the previous stack frame.\n\nStatic allocation, on the other hand, is a method of memory allocation where data is stored in a fixed location in memory. The data is allocated at compile-time and remains in memory until the program exits.\n\nNow, let's examine the language features listed in the question and determine which one requires stack-based storage allocation.\n\nRecursive procedures: Recursive procedures are functions that call themselves. When a recursive function is called, a new stack frame is created, which contains the local variables and function call stack. When the function returns, the stack frame is popped off the stack, and the program continues executing from the previous stack frame. Therefore, recursive procedures require stack-based storage allocation.\n\nArbitrary goto's: Arbitrary goto's are jumps to any point in the program. They can be used to jump to a label or a specific line of code. However, they do not require stack-based storage allocation.\n\nTwo-dimensional arrays: Two-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays. They are stored in memory as a single block of memory, and their elements are accessed using two indices. Two-dimensional arrays do not require stack-based storage allocation.\n\nInteger-valued functions: Integer-valued functions are functions that return an integer value. They do not require stack-based storage allocation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A) Recursive procedures.",

However, I can provide some general information about pipelining and instruction-set features that may be relevant.\n\nPipelining is a technique used in computer architecture to improve performance by executing instructions in parallel. In a pipelined processor, instructions are broken down into smaller, simpler steps that can be executed in parallel. This allows the processor to work on multiple instructions simultaneously, which can significantly improve performance.\n\nSome instruction-set features that may be obstacles to aggressive pipelining include:\n\n- Condition codes set by every instruction: If every instruction sets condition codes, this can slow down the pipeline because the processor must wait for the condition codes to be set before it can execute the next instruction.\n- Variable-length encoding of instructions: If instructions have variable-length encoding, this can slow down the pipeline because the processor must decode the instruction before it can execute it.\n- Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute: If some instructions require more cycles to execute than others, this can slow down the pipeline because the processor must wait for the slower instructions to finish before it can execute the faster ones.\n- Several different classes (sets) of registers: If there are several different classes of registers, this can slow down the pipeline because the processor must switch between different sets of registers to access the data it needs.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific implementation of the integer unit being referred to may have different characteristics and constraints that affect pipelining.
