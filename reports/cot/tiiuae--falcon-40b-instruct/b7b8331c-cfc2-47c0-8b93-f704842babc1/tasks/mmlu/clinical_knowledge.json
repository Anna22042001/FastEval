            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) because the arteries have elastic recoil, which allows them to expand and contract with each heartbeat. This means that even when the left ventricle is not contracting, the blood can still flow through the vessels due to the elastic recoil of the arteries.",

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Graves Disease of the thyroid is a cause of ophthalmoplegia. \n\nExplanation:\n\nGraves Disease of the thyroid is an autoimmune disease that causes hyperthyroidism. It is characterized by the production of thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSH-RAs) that bind to and activate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) on the thyroid gland. This leads to an increase in thyroid hormone production and secretion, resulting in hyperthyroidism.\n\nOphthalmoplegia is a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis of the muscles that control eye movements. It is a common complication of Graves Disease, affecting up to 50% of patients. The mechanism of ophthalmoplegia in Graves Disease is thought to be due to the autoimmune process that causes the hyperthyroidism. The antibodies produced in Graves Disease can also target the extraocular muscles, leading to weakness or paralysis.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (A).",

            "model_answer": "The muscle fibre relaxes when the nerve stimulus is removed. This is because the nerve stimulus triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which in turn bind to troponin on the actin binding sites, causing the muscle fibre to contract. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the calcium ions are reabsorbed into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the muscle fibre to relax.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process of phosphocreatine resynthesis. During high-intensity exercise, the body uses ATP (adenosine triphosphate) as a source of energy. ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The energy released from this reaction is used to power muscle contractions. However, the body can only store a limited amount of ATP, so it needs to resynthesize it quickly to continue exercising. Phosphocreatine is a molecule that can be used to resynthesize ATP. It is stored in the muscles and can be broken down into creatine and Pi. The Pi can then be used to resynthesize ATP. The resynthesis of phosphocreatine takes place in the mitochondria of the muscle cells. The process is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. The rate of resynthesis depends on the amount of phosphocreatine that was used during exercise and the amount of creatine available in the muscles. Based on this information, the answer to the question is (C) about 1 minute.",
