            "model_answer": "The body compensates for increased environmental temperature by increasing respiration rate. This is because when the body is exposed to higher temperatures, it needs to increase the rate of oxygen intake to maintain homeostasis. The increased respiration rate allows for more oxygen to be taken in and carbon dioxide to be expelled, which helps to regulate body temperature.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (D) always 1:1. The ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is always 1:1, regardless of the base sequence. This is because DNA is made up of nucleotides, which are composed of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are either purines (adenine and guanine) or pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil). The ratio of purines to pyrimidines is always 1:1 because the sugar and phosphate groups are the same in all nucleotides, and the nitrogenous bases are complementary to each other.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the process of cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, oxygen is used to break down glucose into carbon dioxide and water. The process of breaking down glucose is called glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. The products of glycolysis are pyruvate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Pyruvate is then transported into the mitochondria, where it is further broken down into carbon dioxide and water through a process called the Krebs cycle. The products of the Krebs cycle are ATP and water. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B) Pyruvate.",

            "model_answer": "The energy released from the breakdown of the high-energy phosphates, ATP and phosphocreatine, can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 30-40 seconds.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 30-40 seconds. This is because ATP is the primary energy source for muscle contraction, and it can be broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in a process that releases energy. However, the amount of ATP stored in the muscle is limited, and it can be depleted within 30-40 seconds of maximal exertion exercise. Once ATP is depleted, the muscle relies on other energy sources such as phosphocreatine and glycogen to continue contracting. Therefore, the energy released from the breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 30-40 seconds.",
