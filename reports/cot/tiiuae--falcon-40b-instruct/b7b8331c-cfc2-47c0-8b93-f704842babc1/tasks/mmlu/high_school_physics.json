            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to use the formula for the electric force between two charged particles: F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2. Here, k is the Coulomb constant, q1 and q2 are the charges on the two particles, and r is the distance between them. We can use this formula to calculate the electric force on each particle, and then compare the magnitudes of the two forces.\n\nLet's start with particle A. Its charge is 2Q, so its electric force is:\n\nF_A = k * 2Q * Q / 4^2 = k * Q^2 / 16\n\nNow let's do the same calculation for particle B:\n\nF_B = k * Q * 2Q / 4^2 = k * Q^2 / 16\n\nSince the two particles have the same charge, their electric forces are equal. Therefore, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is:\n\nF_A / F_B = 1\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) 1:01.",
