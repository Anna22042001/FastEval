This is due to the increased globalisation of the economy, which has led to a more competitive environment for businesses. Companies are looking for countries with lower costs and less regulation, which can lead to a race to the bottom where countries compete to offer the most attractive investment opportunities. This can result in a decrease in social and environmental standards, as countries try to attract businesses by offering lower wages, weaker labor laws, and less stringent environmental regulations. The final line of the question asks for the answer as a single letter with parenthesis, so the answer is (A).",
