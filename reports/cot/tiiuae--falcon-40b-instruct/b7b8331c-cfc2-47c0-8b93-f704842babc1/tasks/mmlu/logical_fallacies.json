This fallacy is often used in advertising and politics to persuade people to believe something is true because it is popular. \n\nThe argument is made by appealing to the emotions of the audience, rather than providing evidence to support the claim. This fallacy is often used to manipulate people into believing something that is not true, and it can be dangerous if it leads to the acceptance of false information. \n\nIn summary, the answer to the question is (D) appeal to the people, also known as _Ad populum_.",
