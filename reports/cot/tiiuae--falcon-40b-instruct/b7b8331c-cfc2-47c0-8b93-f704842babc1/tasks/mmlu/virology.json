            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the purpose of randomization in a clinical trial. Randomization is a process of assigning study subjects to different treatment groups in a way that is not influenced by the researchers or the subjects themselves. This helps to ensure that the groups are comparable and that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment rather than to differences in the groups.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA) Placebo effect: The placebo effect is a phenomenon where a subject's belief in a treatment can affect their outcome. Randomization helps to control for this effect by ensuring that the groups are comparable in terms of their beliefs about the treatment.\n\nB) Recall bias: Recall bias is a type of bias where a subject's memory of past events can be influenced by their current beliefs or experiences. Randomization helps to control for this bias by ensuring that the groups are comparable in terms of their experiences and beliefs.\n\nC) Non-compliance: Non-compliance is a type of bias where a subject does not follow the treatment protocol as prescribed. Randomization helps to control for this bias by ensuring that the groups are comparable in terms of their compliance with the treatment.\n\nD) Effect modification (interaction): Effect modification is a type of bias where the effect of a treatment is different in different subgroups of subjects. Randomization helps to control for this bias by ensuring that the groups are comparable in terms of their characteristics and that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment rather than to differences in the groups.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is option D: Effect modification (interaction).",

In this study design, the participants are not treated or given any intervention, but are simply observed over time. This allows researchers to assess the potential effects of the exposure on the participants over time. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Prospective cohort.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non self. \n\nExplanation:\n\nAdaptive immunity is a type of immunity that is acquired through exposure to a pathogen. It is characterized by the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens, and to mount a more effective response upon subsequent exposure. This is in contrast to innate immunity, which is a more general and non-specific type of immunity that is present at birth.\n\nThe ability to distinguish self and non-self is a key feature of adaptive immunity. This is because the immune system must be able to recognize and target foreign substances (such as bacteria or viruses) while leaving the body's own cells and tissues unharmed. This is achieved through a process called antigen recognition, in which specialized cells called B cells and T cells recognize and bind to specific antigens on the surface of foreign substances.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is (B) Ability to distinguish self and non self, because it is a key feature of adaptive immunity that allows the immune system to recognize and target foreign substances while leaving the body's own cells and tissues unharmed.",

This response helps the body recognize and fight off the disease in the future.
