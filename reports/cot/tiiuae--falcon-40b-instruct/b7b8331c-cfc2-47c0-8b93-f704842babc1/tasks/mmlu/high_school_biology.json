            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the genetics of fur color in minks. Brown fur is dominant over silver fur, which means that if a mink has at least one B allele, it will have brown fur. If a mink has two b alleles, it will have silver fur.\n\nLet's start by looking at the genotypes of the parents. If both parents have brown fur, they must have at least one B allele. Therefore, their genotypes must be either BB or Bb.\n\nNow, let's look at the possible genotypes of the offspring. If the parents have brown fur, they must have at least one B allele. Therefore, the offspring must have at least one B allele as well.\n\nIf the parents have brown fur, the offspring can have either brown or silver fur. If the offspring have brown fur, they must have at least one B allele. If the offspring have silver fur, they must have two b alleles.\n\nBased on this information, we can eliminate answer choices (A) and (D) because they do not produce offspring with silver fur.\n\nWe can also eliminate answer choice (B) because it produces offspring with brown fur, which is not possible if both parents have brown fur.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Bb Bb.",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The correct answer is (C) Some mutations cause such drastic phenotypic changes that they are removed from the gene pool. \n\nExplanation:\n\nMutations can have a range of effects on an organism, from minor changes in appearance to severe genetic disorders. Some mutations may be recessive, meaning that they are only expressed when paired with another copy of the same mutation. However, this does not necessarily mean that the frequency of mutation is low.\n\nThe frequency of mutation is determined by the rate at which mutations occur, which is relatively constant across populations. However, the frequency of certain mutations may appear low because they are removed from the gene pool through natural selection. Mutations that cause severe phenotypic changes, such as those that lead to genetic disorders, are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This is because individuals with these mutations are less likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nIn contrast, mutations that have little or no effect on an organism's fitness are more likely to be passed on to the next generation. These mutations can accumulate over time, leading to ongoing variability in a gene pool.\n\nTherefore, the statement that some mutations cause such drastic phenotypic changes that they are removed from the gene pool is the least likely reason for the frequency of mutation appearing to be low.",

This is because if the potential mates are geographically isolated, they may not come into contact with each other and therefore cannot mate.\n\nThe potential mates experience behavioral isolation (B) is also an example of an event that can prevent interspecific breeding. This is because if the potential mates have different behavioral patterns, they may not recognize each other as potential mates and therefore cannot mate.\n\nThe potential mates have different courtship rituals (C) is not an example of an event that can prevent interspecific breeding.
