            "model_answer": "The number of hidden nodes is the structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a neural network. This is because the number of hidden nodes determines the complexity of the model and the amount of data it can learn from. If there are too few hidden nodes, the model may underfit and not be able to capture the underlying patterns in the data. If there are too many hidden nodes, the model may overfit and memorize the specific patterns in the training data, leading to poor generalization performance. Therefore, the number of hidden nodes is a critical parameter to tune in order to achieve a good balance between underfitting and overfitting.",

This penalty is proportional to the sum of the squares of the weights, which means that the model will be penalized for having large weights.\n\nWhen we increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, we are increasing the penalty for having large weights. This means that the model will be forced to have smaller weights, which will reduce the bias of the model.\n\nHowever, the penalty for having large weights will also reduce the variance of the model. This is because the penalty will force the model to have smaller weights, which means that the model will be less sensitive to small fluctuations in the data.\n\nTherefore, when we increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient, the bias of the model will decrease, but the variance of the model will also decrease.",

Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has already occurred. In this case, we have three random variables A, B, and C, and we want to find the probability of A given B and C.\n\nLet's start by considering the probability of A given B. This can be written as P(A | B). Similarly, we can write the probability of B given C as P(B | C).\n\nNow, we can use the law of total probability to calculate the probability of A given B and C. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event is equal to the sum of the probabilities of all the possible causes of that event. In this case, the possible causes of A given B and C are B and C.\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(A | B, C) = P(A | B) * P(B | C)\n\nThis equation tells us that the probability of A given B and C is equal to the probability of A given B multiplied by the probability of B given C.\n\nNow, we can use the same logic to calculate the probability of B given A and C.
