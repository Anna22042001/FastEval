The strength of the hydrogen ion is determined by the number of electrons it has. In general, the more electrons a hydrogen ion has, the stronger the acid.\n\nIn the given compounds, H2SeO3 has the least number of electrons on the hydrogen ion, followed by H2SO3, HClO, and HBrO.

This means that the products of the reaction have a lower energy than the reactants. The equilibrium constant, Keq, is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of the products to the reactants at equilibrium. If Keq is less than one, then the products have a lower concentration than the reactants, which means that the reaction is spontaneous.",
