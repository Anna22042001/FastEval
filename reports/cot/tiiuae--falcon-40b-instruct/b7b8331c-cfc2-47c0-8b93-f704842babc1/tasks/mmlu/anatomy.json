            "model_answer": "The answer is (C).\n\nExplanation:\n\nDuring embryonic development, the palate is formed from the fusion of the palatine processes, frontonasal processes, and secondary nasal processes. In complete bilateral cleft palate, the fusion of these processes is incomplete, resulting in a gap in the roof of the mouth. Therefore, the answer is (C).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (A).\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth is called the attached gingiva. In a healthy mouth, the attached gingiva should be light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingival junction. This is because the attached gingiva is composed of a thin layer of non-keratinized epithelium that is well-vascularized and contains a large number of capillaries. The presence of these capillaries gives the attached gingiva its pinkish colour.\n\nIn contrast, the mucosa covering the alveolar process above the mucogingival junction is called the marginal gingiva. This gingiva is thicker and more keratinized than the attached gingiva, and it is not as well-vascularized. As a result, the marginal gingiva is usually red in colour.\n\nTherefore, in a patient with a normal healthy mouth, you would expect the mucosa covering the alveolar process supporting the mandibular teeth to be light pink in colour on both sides of the mucogingival junction, and red above it.",

It is responsible for the growth and development of the skull and the face. The synchondrosis is active during childhood and adolescence, and it ceases activity at around 7 years of age. It does not influence the position of the viscerocranium, and it cannot be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly. Therefore, the answer is (B).",
