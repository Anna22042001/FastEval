            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy. The chemical shift is the difference in frequency between the resonance of a particular nucleus in a molecule and the resonance of the same nucleus in a reference compound. The reference compound is usually TMS (tetramethylsilane) or CDCl3 (chloroform-d). The chemical shift is influenced by the chemical environment of the nucleus, and it can be used to identify the structure of a molecule.\n\nIn the given question, we are asked to identify the compound that has a 1H resonance approximately 1.55 kHz away from TMS on a spectrometer with a 12.0 T magnet. This means that the chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in the given compound is approximately 1.55 kHz away from the chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in TMS.\n\nLet's start by considering the chemical structures of the given compounds. CH3F is a linear molecule with a single bond between the carbon and fluorine atoms. CH3Cl is a linear molecule with a single bond between the carbon and chlorine atoms. CH3Br is a linear molecule with a single bond between the carbon and bromine atoms. CH3I is a linear molecule with a single bond between the carbon and iodine atoms.\n\nNow, let's consider the chemical shifts of the 1H nuclei in these compounds. The chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in TMS is approximately 0.0 ppm. The chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in CH3F is approximately -0.5 ppm. The chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in CH3Cl is approximately -0.5 ppm. The chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in CH3Br is approximately -0.5 ppm. The chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in CH3I is approximately -0.5 ppm.\n\nBased on the chemical shifts of the 1H nuclei in these compounds, we can eliminate CH3F and CH3I as possible answers. The chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in CH3F is approximately -0.5 ppm, which is closer to the chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in TMS than the chemical shift of the 1H nucleus in CH3Cl, CH3Br, and CH3I. Therefore, the correct answer is CH3Cl.",

The central atom in SOCl2 is sulfur, which has a valence of 6. This means that it can form 6 bonds.\n\n2. The number of bonds that sulfur can form is 2, which means that it can form two single bonds.\n\n3. The number of bonds that chlorine can form is 8, which means that it can form 4 single bonds.\n\n4. The number of bonds that sulfur can form with chlorine is 2, which means that it can form two single bonds.\n\n5.
