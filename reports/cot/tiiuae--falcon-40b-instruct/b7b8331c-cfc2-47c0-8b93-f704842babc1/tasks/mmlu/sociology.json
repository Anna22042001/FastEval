            "model_answer": "The embourgeoisement thesis suggests that the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life. This is because they have access to more resources and opportunities, which allows them to adopt middle class lifestyles. The introduction of new technologies has also made white collar occupations more accessible to the working class, further blurring the lines between social classes. Therefore, the embourgeoisement thesis suggests that the class structure has become more fluid and less rigid, with fewer distinct social classes.",

However, I can provide information that may help you make an informed decision. \n\nWeber's definition of a 'class situation' is a sociological concept that refers to the social position of individuals or groups in society. It includes factors such as economic resources, social status, and lifestyle. \n\nBased on the given options, option (B) seems to be the closest match to Weber's definition.
