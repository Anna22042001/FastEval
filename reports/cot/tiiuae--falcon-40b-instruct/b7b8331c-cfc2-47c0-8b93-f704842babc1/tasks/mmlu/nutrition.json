            "question": "The amount and composition of dietary fat are important factors for influencing blood lipid metabolism. Which of the following statements is correct?\n\n\n(A) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations\n(B) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids is associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol\n(C) Consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols is associated with a significant increases in LDL cholesterol\n(D) Replacement of saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate is associated with decreased LDL and increased plasma triglyceride concentrations",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between dietary fat and blood lipid metabolism. \n\nSaturated fatty acids (SFA) are the most common type of dietary fat and are found in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs. They are also found in some plant-based foods such as coconut oil and palm oil. SFA can increase LDL cholesterol levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease. \n\nMonounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are found in foods such as olive oil, nuts, and avocados. They can lower LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL cholesterol levels, which is a protective factor for heart disease. \n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are found in foods such as fish, nuts, and seeds. They can lower LDL cholesterol levels and increase HDL cholesterol levels. \n\nBased on the given statements, we can eliminate options (B) and (D) as they are not consistent with the relationship between dietary fat and blood lipid metabolism. \n\nOption (A) is correct as it states that replacing SFA with n-6 PUFA can reduce plasma triglyceride concentrations, which is a risk factor for heart disease. \n\nOption (C) is also correct as it states that consumption of soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols can significantly increase HDL cholesterol levels, which is a protective factor for heart disease. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is (A) and (C).",
