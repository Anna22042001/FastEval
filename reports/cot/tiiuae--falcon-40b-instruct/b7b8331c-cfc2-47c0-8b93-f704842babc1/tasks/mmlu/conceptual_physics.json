            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of a galvanometer. A galvanometer is an instrument used to measure the strength of an electric current. It consists of a coil of wire that is suspended between the poles of a magnet. When a current flows through the coil, it experiences a force that causes it to rotate. The amount of rotation is proportional to the strength of the current. Therefore, a galvanometer can be calibrated to read electric current.",

The nucleus that emits the beta particle is called the parent nucleus, and the nucleus that absorbs the beta particle is called the daughter nucleus. The atomic number of the parent nucleus is the number of protons in its nucleus, and the atomic number of the daughter nucleus is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. Therefore, the answer to the question is (B).",

It is divided into three primary colors: red, green, and blue. These three colors are the base colors from which all other colors are derived. The complementary color of blue is yellow. This is because yellow is the color that is opposite blue on the color wheel. When blue and yellow are combined, they create a neutral gray color. Therefore, the answer is (C) cyan.",
