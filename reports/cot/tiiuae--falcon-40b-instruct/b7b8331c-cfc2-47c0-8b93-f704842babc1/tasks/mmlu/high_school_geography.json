            "model_answer": "I will now explain my reasoning step-by-step.\n\nThe United States is the largest producer of natural gas in the world, and it has abundant coal reserves. It also has significant oil reserves, although it imports a significant amount of oil. Therefore, the United States is not the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nJapan has limited natural resources, and it imports most of its energy needs. It has limited oil and gas reserves, and it relies heavily on nuclear power. Therefore, Japan is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nFrance has limited natural resources, and it imports most of its energy needs. It has limited oil and gas reserves, and it relies heavily on nuclear power. Therefore, France is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nThe United Kingdom has limited natural resources, and it imports most of its energy needs. It has limited oil and gas reserves, and it relies heavily on nuclear power. Therefore, the United Kingdom is the least self-sufficient in the natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) United Kingdom.",

A world city is a city that is considered to be a major global economic, political, and cultural center.

Many transnational corporations have their headquarters in world cities, which helps them to have a global presence and reach. \n\nOption (B) is also correct as it is a characteristic of world cities.

            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) agglomeration. \n\nExplanation:\n\nAgglomeration refers to the concentration of production activities and people in a particular area. This can lead to benefits such as increased productivity, lower costs, and improved access to resources. It is a common economic development strategy that aims to attract businesses and workers to a specific location. \n\nThe substitution principle, on the other hand, refers to the idea that a good can be replaced by another good that is cheaper or more efficient. Deglomeration, on the other hand, refers to the process of breaking up a large company into smaller ones. Infrastructure refers to the physical and organizational structures that support economic activity, such as roads, bridges, and telecommunications networks. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) agglomeration.",
