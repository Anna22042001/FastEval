            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The answer is (C) synthetic and a priori.\n\nExplanation:\n\nKant's moral philosophy is based on the idea that morality is grounded in reason. He believed that there are certain moral principles that are universally applicable and that can be known through reason alone. These principles are known as \"categorical imperatives\" and are based on the idea of duty.\n\nKant believed that the categorical imperative is a synthetic a priori principle. This means that it is a moral principle that is not derived from experience, but rather from reason alone. It is also a principle that is universally applicable and can be known through reason alone.\n\nKant believed that the categorical imperative is a synthetic principle because it is not a simple statement of fact, but rather a prescription for action. It tells us what we ought to do, rather than simply describing what is.\n\nKant believed that the categorical imperative is a priori because it is a principle that is known through reason alone, without any reference to experience. It is a principle that is known to be true simply by thinking about it, without any need for empirical evidence.\n\nIn summary, the supreme principle of morality according to Kant is the categorical imperative, which is a synthetic a priori principle that is universally applicable and can be known through reason alone.",
