            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The onset of labor is first triggered by the secretion of hormones by the Mother's hypothalamus. The hypothalamus releases a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol, which in turn stimulates the release of prostaglandins from the placenta and uterus. These prostaglandins cause contractions of the uterus, which lead to the onset of labor.",
