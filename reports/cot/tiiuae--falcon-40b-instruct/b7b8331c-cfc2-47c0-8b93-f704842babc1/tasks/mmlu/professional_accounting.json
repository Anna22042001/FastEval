            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand the criteria for segment disclosure. According to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), a segment is required to be disclosed if it meets any of the following criteria: 1) the segment's operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance; 2) the segment's products or services are subject to significant competition and the CODM is responsible for allocating resources to the segment; 3) the segment's products or services are subject to significant regulation or oversight by a regulatory body. Based on the information provided, it is clear that segment A meets the first criteria, segment B meets the second criteria, and segment C meets the third criteria. Therefore, all three segments are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31 year 2 financial statements.",

One of the key elements of these policies and procedures is the requirement for professional skepticism of management. This means that the auditor must approach the audit with an attitude of skepticism and must be alert to the possibility of management bias or fraud. The auditor must also be prepared to challenge management's assumptions and assertions, and to seek independent verification of information provided by management. Therefore, (B) Professional skepticism of management is the correct answer.",
