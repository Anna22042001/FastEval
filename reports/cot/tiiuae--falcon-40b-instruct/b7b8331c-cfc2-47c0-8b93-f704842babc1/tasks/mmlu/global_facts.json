According to the World Bank, the estimated population of Brazil in 2017 was 209 million. \n\nNext, we need to find the number of people who used the internet in the past three months. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the number of people who used the internet in the past three months was 153 million in 2017. \n\nTo calculate the fraction of the population who used the internet in the past three months, we divide the number of people who used the internet by the total population and multiply by 100. \n\nTherefore, the fraction of the population in Brazil who used the internet in the past three months is: \n\n153 million / 209 million * 100 = 73.3% \n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 78%.",
