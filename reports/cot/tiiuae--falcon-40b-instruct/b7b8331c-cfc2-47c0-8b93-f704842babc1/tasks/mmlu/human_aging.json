            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors:\n\n1. Age: Older workers are more likely to have health issues and may require more time off for medical appointments.\n\n2. Experience: Older workers may have more experience and be more productive than younger workers.\n\n3. Job satisfaction: Older workers may be more satisfied with their jobs and less likely to leave.\n\n4. Layoffs: Older workers may be more likely to be laid off due to their higher salaries and benefits.\n\nBased on these factors, it is difficult to determine a definitive answer. However, it is possible that older workers may be more likely to be absent from work due to health issues, but also more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and less likely to be laid off due to their experience and job security.",
