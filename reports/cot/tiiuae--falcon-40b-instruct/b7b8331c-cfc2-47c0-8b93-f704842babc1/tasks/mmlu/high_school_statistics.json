The teachers want more money, and the district, claiming, as always, budget constraints, wants to pay as little as possible. The district, like most, has a large number of moderately paid teachers and a few highly paid administrators. The salaries of all teachers and administrators are included in trying to figure out, on average, how much the professional staff currently earn. Which of the following would the teachers' union be most likely to quote during negotiations?\n\n(A) The mean of all the salaries.\n(B) The mode of all the salaries.\n(C) The standard deviation of all the salaries.\n(D) The median of all the salaries.",
            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "The teachers' union would be most likely to quote the median of all the salaries during negotiations. This is because the median is a measure of central tendency that is less affected by outliers than the mean or standard deviation. The median is the middle value in a set of data, and half of the data points are above it and half are below it. This means that the median is less likely to be skewed by a few very high salaries, which could happen with the mean or standard deviation. Therefore, the median is a better representation of the typical salary for the professional staff.",

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today. We can do this by using the normal distribution formula:\n\nP(X < z) = 0.5 * (1 - 0.5/2) = 0.25\n\nwhere X is the mean daily demand for bread, z is the standard deviation, and P(X < z) is the probability that the mean daily demand for bread will be less than z.\n\nIn this case, the mean daily demand for bread is 2,500 loaves, and the standard deviation is 225 loaves. Therefore, the probability that the mean daily demand for bread will be less than 2,500 - 225 = 2,275 loaves is:\n\nP(X < 2,275) = 0.25\n\nSince the bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning, the probability that it will run out of bread today is:\n\nP(X < 2,275) = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the answer is (A): 0.8333.",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first understand what a discrete probability distribution is. A discrete probability distribution is a probability distribution that can take on only a finite or countably infinite number of values. In other words, it is a probability distribution where the possible outcomes are discrete, meaning they are distinct and separate from each other.\n\nNow, let's examine each of the given options:\n\nOption (A): The expected value of a random variable is the sum of all possible values of the random variable multiplied by their respective probabilities. Therefore, if we know the probability distribution of X, we can calculate the expected value of X. However, the expected value of X does not necessarily equal np, where n is the number of possible values of X.\n\nOption (B): This option is true. The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one because a probability distribution is a measure of the likelihood of each possible outcome. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of X must be equal to one.\n\nOption (C): This option is also true. The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one because a probability distribution is a measure of the likelihood of each possible outcome. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of X must be equal to one.\n\nOption (D): This option is not necessarily true. The probability distribution of X can take on many different shapes, including bell-shaped and symmetric, but it is not always the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B).",
