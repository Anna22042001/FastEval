Size adjectives\n4. Shape adjectives\n5. Age adjectives\n6. Color (nationality or ethnic origin) adjectives\n7.

Here are some general guidelines:\n\n1. Always use possessive pronouns when referring to a specific item or animal. For example, instead of saying \"She loves my dog.\" you should say \"She loves its fur.\"\n\n2. Use possessive adjectives instead of possessive pronouns when the noun being referred to does not require gender identification. For example, instead of saying \"Her cat is black and white,\" you can say \"Her cat is a calico.\"\n\n3. When using possessive pronouns or adjectives in a sentence, they should typically come before the noun they are modifying. For example, \"The girl's cat is black and white.\"\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your writing is clear, concise, and easy to understand.",

The second group of adjectives (rectangular) further modifies the noun \"big.\" Rectangular describes the shape of the object we are talking about. If we were to say \"pink big shoe,\" the adjective order would still be a bit confusing as we don't know what kind of shoe it is. Is it just a pink shoe, or a pink steel shoe? So we need to add the adjective \"steel\" to modify the noun \"shoe\" further. \n\n3. Finally, we have the third group of adjectives (exercise.) This group modifies the function or use of the object we are talking about. \n\nFor example, we could say \"big, rectangular, steel exercise shoe,\" but now we have three adjectives in a row describing the shoe. It would be preferable to group them in two pairs, with the function/use coming last. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that adjectives need to agree in quantity and gender with the noun they modify. In this case, since the noun is singular (even though it's being described by several adjectives), all the adjectives should be singular and agree with the noun in gender (if applicable, i.e., if the noun is referring to a person or animal.) \n\nTherefore, the correct order for the three groups of adjectives is:\n\n\"big\", \"rectangular\", \"steel\" (with the three adjectives being singular and agreeing in gender with the noun).",
