It follows two rival Hollywood police detectives who are investigating the murder of one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The movie has a similar plot as the Silence of the Lambs, where both are psychological thrillers that involve murder and are set in Los Angeles.\n\nForrest Gump: This is a classic drama film starring Tom Hanks. It tells the story of a simple-minded man who witnessed major historical events and became famous in the process. It shares a similar plot with Schindler's List, both movies are set during World War II and portray the lives of ordinary people who encountered extraordinary circumstances. Both movies also have a message of hope and redemption.\n\nEddie the Eagle: This is a biopic about the first British ski jumper to take part in the Winter Olympics.

We can further refine the list by considering user preferences and movie similarity scores.\n\n8. One popular user movie similarity prediction algorithm is Recommender Systems (RS). RS works by finding similar users, measuring the similarities between their movie ratings, and then predicting the ratings of new movies based on these similarities.\n\n9. We can use RS to find movies that people who have rated the input movies also like. We can use tools like Pystruct to build RS models.\n\n   For example, we can run a query like this: https://pystruct.com/docs/getting-started/",
