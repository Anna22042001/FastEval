The blue stress ball and the red puzzle are directly next to each other, so we can safely eliminate them as our reference points.\n\n2. The purple cat toy is next to the red object, so we know that it is closer to the red object than the object we are looking for. Therefore, the object we are looking for is further away from the red object than the purple cat toy.\n\n3. The object we are looking for is also further away from the red object than the object immediately to its right, which is the stress ball.\n\n4. Since the object is not between the stress ball and the purple cat toy, it must be beyond the purple cat toy.\n\n5. Finally, since the object is not between the cat toy and the red object, it must be on the left side of the desk.\n\nNow that we have narrowed down our search, we can move on to the final step: identifying the color of the object.\n\n6. The object furthest from the red object is the silver cat toy. To know what color it is, we will need to refer to the original arrangement, where we see that it is silver.\n\nTherefore, our final answer is:\n\n<pre>\nThe color of the object furthest from the red object is silver or (K)\n</pre>\n\nNow we can output the final answer:\n\n<pre>\n(K)\n</pre>",
