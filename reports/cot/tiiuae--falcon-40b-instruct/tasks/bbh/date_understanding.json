From now we will call this date X.\n\nAssistant: Jane ate a new egg each day, so she was consuming the eggs at a constant rate. Therefore she always had 40 eggs in stock.\n\nAssistant: After she ate the last egg, there were no more eggs left in stock, so the process of egg-consumption stopped.\n\nAssistant: If Jane had kept eating the eggs at the same rate, she would have finished them on 06/18/2017. But she didn't, so the eggs lasted her until 06/08/2017. This means she still had the eggs for a period of 40 days from 05/09/2017.\n\nAssistant: Therefore, it is 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY than when she ran out of eggs, which is 06/09/2017.

Therefore, the first day of each month will always be the same weekday. So if we want to find out what day of the week it was one year ago on May 6, 2018, we can simply look at today's date, move back a year and assume the same weekday.\n\nToday's date, May 6, 2019 is a Monday.

            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to first convert the \"today\" part from natural language to a date format. We can then compare the current local time to yesterday's local time and use that to calculate the date one year ago. Finally, we can output the answer in the desired format.\n\nLet's begin by parsing the natural language date. I recognize that \"today\" refers to the current date and I can use the system clock to get the current date in the following format: \"MM/DD/YYYY\". To parse the date correctly, we need to convert the string in this format to a date object.\n\nTo do this, we can use a common Python date parsing library, such as <code>dateutil.parser</code>. This library provides functions to parse different formats of dates, including custom formats. We can use this library to convert the string \"MM/DD/YYYY\" to a <code>datetime.date</code> object:\n\n<code>from dateutil.parser import parse</code>\ncurrent_date = parse(' today')[0]\n\nFrom here, we need to convert the date object to a string in the desired format: \"MM/DD/YYYY\" once more. Again, we can use a library to help, such as <code>strftime</code> from the <code>datetime</code> module:\n\n<code>current_date_string = current_date.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')</code>\n\nNow we have the date string \"05/04/2004\" formatted in the desired way. Now, to calculate the date one year ago, we can use subtraction to subtract one year from the current date:\n\n<code>one_year_ago = current_date - datetime.timedelta(days=365",
