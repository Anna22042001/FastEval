Sarcasm, in its most basic form, can be distinguished from literal language by its use of irony. Irony is a figure of speech or literary style that expresses the opposite of what is meant. In other words, sarcasm involves saying the opposite of what you mean in an attempt to humor, tease, or mock the listener.\n\nNow, examining the options, it is clear that the second statement is the sarcastic option. The first statement is simply making an objective observation about the culinary preferences of the speaker. Therefore, the statement that includes the words \"Everyone knows\" and a sarcasm indicator, like \"really\" or \"don't they,\" is most likely sarcastic.\n\nTherefore, in order to indicate sarcasm, you could say something like:\n\nWhat a surprise!\n\nor\n\n\"That's the best thing I've heard all day.\" (sarcasm indicator: eye roll).",
