Complementary DNA sequences are formed by pairing the nitrogenous bases (A, T, C, G) in a specific manner: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the given sequence\nThe given sequence is 5\u2032 CGA TTG 3\u2032. This sequence contains three nitrogenous bases: C, G, and A.\n\nStep 3: Determine the complementary base for each nitrogenous base\nNow, we need to find the complementary base for each nitrogenous base in the given sequence. We do this by using the base pairing rules:\n\n- C pairs with G\n- G pairs with C\n- A pairs with T\n\nStep 4: Construct the complementary sequence\nUsing the complementary bases, we construct the complementary sequence:\n\n(C) \u2192 (G)\n(G) \u2192 (C)\n(A) \u2192 (T)\n\nStep 5: Combine the complementary bases and determine the correct answer\nCombining the complementary bases, we get the sequence 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032. Comparing this sequence with the answer choices, we find that it matches option (B).\n\nAnswer: (B) 5\u2032 GCT AAC 3\u2032",

Mycorrhizal fungi help plants access phosphorus, an essential nutrient that is often limited in many types of soils.\n\n(D) They provide carbon to plants in exchange for fixed nitrogen.\nThis option is incorrect because mycorrhizal fungi do not provide carbon to plants.

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze each statement individually.\n\n(A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\nThis statement is correct, as the Golgi apparatus is indeed positioned in the cytoplasm with its cis face near the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The Golgi apparatus receives proteins and lipids synthesized by the ER and modifies them before packaging and shipping them to their final destinations.\n\n(B) It is typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face.\nThis statement is also correct. The cis face of the Golgi apparatus is where proteins and lipids are received from the ER, and small secretory vesicles are often found in this region to facilitate the transport of these molecules.\n\n(C) Its composite flattened cisternae are continuous with one another.\nThis statement is correct as well. The Golgi apparatus is composed of flattened cisternae, which are connected to each other, forming a continuous structure. This arrangement allows for the efficient processing and transport of proteins and lipids within the Golgi apparatus.\n\n(D) Glycosylation of certain secretory proteins occurs prior to the protein's entry into its lumen.\nThis statement is incorrect. Glycosylation, the process of adding sugar molecules to proteins, occurs within the Golgi apparatus after the proteins have entered the lumen. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for modifying and processing proteins and lipids, including glycosylation, before they are transported to their final destinations.\n\nStep 2: Compare the statements and determine which one is the most accurate.\nBased on the analysis of each statement, (A) and (B) are both correct, while (C) and (D) are incorrect.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer.\nThe correct answer is (A) It is oriented in the cytoplasm so that its cis face is closest to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nAnswer: (A)",

This binding initiates the sperm's acrosomal reaction, which is a crucial step in fertilization.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement\n\n(A) Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization.\nIf we inject eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3, it would prevent the sperm's receptor proteins from binding to ZP3, thus blocking the acrosomal reaction and in vitro fertilization.\n\n(B) Incubating sperm with purified ZP3 prior to mixing sperm and eggs blocks in vitro fertilization.\nBy incubating sperm with purified ZP3, the sperm's receptor proteins would bind to ZP3, triggering the acrosomal reaction before the sperm meets the egg.
