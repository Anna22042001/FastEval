            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the program to be tested.\nAs we don't have the program, we can't directly apply it, but in general, we want to make sure that every line of code is executed during testing. This is known as code coverage or path coverage.\n\nStep 2: Understand the types of fuzzers.\nNow, let's consider what each type of fuzzer does.\n\nA) Generational: This type of fuzzer generates test cases based on some initial seed inputs. It tries to find a boundary in the input space by slightly modifying the initial test case. In many iterations, it can cover the input space thoroughly, but it doesn't necessarily cover all lines of code in the program.\n\nB) Blackbox: A blackbox fuzzer doesn't look at the code of the program to be tested. It behaves more like an end user and feeds it with data to observe the outcome. This may result in code paths not being covered if the fuzzer doesn't happen to find the right inputs to trigger those paths.\n\nC) Whitebox: This type of fuzzer constructs test cases using a model of the program. It knows the structure and the logic of the program, and it tries to ensure that test cases cover all possible paths.\n\nD) Mutation-based: A mutation-based fuzzer creates a test suite, then modifies the test suite slightly to create mutant test cases. This can help expose hidden defects, but like the generational fuzzer, it doesn't necessarily cover all lines of code in the program.\n\nStep 3: Compare the fuzzers.\nBetween a generational and a whitebox fuzzer, the whitebox fuzzer is more likely to explore paths covering every line of code in the program than the generational fuzzer. This is because the whitebox fuzzer constructs test cases using a model of the program, which can help to ensure that all code paths are covered.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer.\n()",

            "question": "Assume that a TLS connection has been established successfully between a client and a server. Establishing the session included checking the server certificate and executing a DiffieHelmann exchange, but the client did not provide a client certificate. Further, assume that the client and server are honest, that the client and server don\u2019t leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. Which of the following attacks does TLS protect against?\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier.\n2. An attacker impersonating the server.\n\n(A) True, True\n(B) False, False\n(C) True, False\n(D) False, True",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Explanation of TLS (Transport Layer Security)\nTLS is a protocol that provides secure and encrypted communication channels over a computer network. It is used to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery, primarily in web traffic.\n\nStep 2: Explanation of session establishment\nWhen establishing a TLS connection, the client and server exchange information to create a secure connection. This includes checking the server's SSL certificate to ensure the server's identity. If the certificate is valid, the client and server execute a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to generate symmetric session keys, which are then used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged during the session.\n\nStep 3: Explanation of offered protection based on given assumptions\nIn this scenario, the client and server are considered to be honest, meaning they will not attempt to cheat or expose their keys. Additionally, the cryptography used in the TLS connection is assumed to be reliable and effective.\n\nStep 4: Explanation of the attacks TLS protects against based on given options\n\n1. An attacker replaying bytes that a client sent earlier: TLS protects against replay attacks by generating unique message authentication codes (MACs) for each data packet, ensuring that the order of the packets is maintained, and implementing a sliding window mechanism to prevent old packets from being processed. Therefore, a replayed byte would not be successful since it would not have the correct MAC and would be out of sequence.\n\n2. An attacker impersonating the server: TLS protects against server impersonation attacks during the initial handshake. When the server replies to the client's initial connection request, it sends its SSL certificate, which contains its public key. The client verifies the server's identity by checking the SSL certificate against a list of trusted certificate authorities (CA). If the SSL certificate is valid and trusted, the client proceeds with the session, ensuring that it is communicating with the legitimate server.\n\nAnswer: (A) True, True",

            "question": "MIT\u2019s Kerberos KDC server has a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours (for most user principals). What ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used?\n\n(A) The Kerberos server (KDC) refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets.\n(B) When a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, which ensures a client cannot remain connected past the ticket\u2019s maximum lifetime.\n(C) When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to the server\u2019s current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past.\n(D) When a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid with respect to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports that the ticket is expired.",

            "model_answer": "The question asks what ensures that an expired Kerberos ticket can no longer be used. To find the correct answer among the options provided, we need to understand how the Kerberos authentication protocol works. \n\n(A) This answer describes the Kerberos server (KDC) refusing to establish new connections for expired tickets. However, it doesn't explain why the client cannot use an expired ticket.\n\n(B) This option is incorrect because the client-to-server connection isn't automatically terminated by a 24-hour timer. The ticket is checked at the connection establishment, and then the client can perform operations until the ticket's expiration time is reached.\n\n(C) This option explains that when a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to its own clock. If the ticket's expiration time is in the past, the server will not authenticate the user. This has the effect of ensuring an expired ticket can no longer be used because the server will not approve it.\n\n(D) This option suggests that when a client connects to a server, the server checks with the KDC if the ticket is valid with respect to the KDC's clock. If the KDC says the ticket is expired, the server will not authenticate the user. This mirrors the same effect as (C), ensuring an expired ticket can no longer be used. \n\nBased on the how Kerberos authentication works and considering the provided options, the correct answer is (C) or (D). The difference between (C) and (D) is who performs the check: the server itself (C) or the KDC (D). However, the net effect and the reasoning are the same for both options.

While memory leaks can lead to system slowdowns and crashes, they do not directly enable an attacker to gain access or cause malfunction.\n\n(B) Buffer-overrun: A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than the buffer is designed to hold.

If these instructions are allowed, a sandboxed module could potentially access unauthorized memory areas by modifying the segment registers.\n\n(B) All loads or stores to addresses that are not 0 mod 32: This restriction may not necessarily prevent all dangerous behavior, as it does not account for indirect access methods or control flow manipulation.\n\n(C) All indirect loads or stores (via an address in a register or variable): This is the correct answer. Indirect loads and stores can be used to bypass the NaCl sandbox restrictions by accessing memory outside the data area of the sandboxed module. By forbidding these instructions, NaCl can ensure that the module only accesses memory directly, without involving any indirect addressing methods.\n\n(D) All indirect jumps (via an address in a register or variable): Indirect jumps can be used to change the control flow of the program, potentially allowing the module to execute code outside its own code area. This could bypass the NaCl sandbox restrictions, making this answer partially correct.\n\nConsidering the above reasoning, the correct answer is (C) and (D), but only (C) is specified as required in the question.
