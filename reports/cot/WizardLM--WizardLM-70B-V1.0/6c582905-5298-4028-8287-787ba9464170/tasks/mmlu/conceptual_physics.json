            "model_answer": "Step 1: Identify the relevant formula\nTo find the horizontal component of a force, we can use the formula:\n\nHorizontal Component = Force \u00d7 cos(Angle)\n\nIn this problem, the force is 10 N and the angle is 45\u00b0. We need to convert the angle from degrees to radians for the formula, as the cosine function in calculations typically uses radians.\n\nStep 2: Convert the angle from degrees to radians\n1 radian = (180\u00b0 / \u03c0) \u2248 57.3\u00b0\nSo, 45\u00b0 = (45\u00b0 * \u03c0) / 180 = \u03c0/4 radians\n\nStep 3: Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncos(\u03c0/4) \u2248 \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.707\n\nStep 4: Calculate the horizontal component\nHorizontal Component = Force \u00d7 cos(Angle)\nHorizontal Component = 10 N \u00d7 0.707\nHorizontal Component \u2248 7 N\n\nSo, the answer is (A) 7 N.",

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "First, let's consider the four options one by one and evaluate them based on the principle that there is no net force (Newton's third law) on a completely submerged object due to the surrounding fluid acting equally in all directions.\n\n(A) Weight of fluid: The weight of the fluid displaced by the object is equal to the weight of the object. If the object is completely submerged, the force of gravity acting on the object is balanced by the upward force from the fluid, which equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\n(B) Volume of fluid: The volume of fluid displaced by the object is indeed equal to the volume of the object that is submerged. This is because, according to Archimedes' principle, the object displaces a volume of fluid equal to its own volume in order to float or remain submerged.\n\n(C) Density of fluid: The density of the fluid remains constant regardless of the presence of the submerged object, as long as the object does not change the fluid's density by reacting with it or by some other means. The displacement of fluid when an object is submerged does not affect the density of the fluid.\n\nBased on the evaluation above, we can see that options (A) and (B) hold true for a completely submerged object, while option (C) does not. Therefore, the correct statement would be:\n\n(D) All of these. However, this option is incorrect because though (A) is correct, (C) is incorrect.\n\nThus the correct answer is (A) weight of fluid. This means the object's weight is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces when completely submerged. The final output is:\n\n(A)",

The problem asks for the fate of the light beam.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options\nNow, we will consider each answer option and see which one aligns with the principles of physics and the described scenario:\n\n(A) Total internal reflection: This occurs when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle for the specific boundary. It doesn't match the given scenario where the beam of light doesn't initially travel in a path parallel to the boundary.\n\n(B) Passes into the air above: This is similar to the behavior described by Snell's law. The angle of incidence is 20\u00b0 from the normal, so the light beam will partially refract into the air above the water and partially reflect off the surface.\n\n(C) Absorbed: This option doesn't align with any principle of light behavior or interaction with a boundary, especially since the light source is a flashlight.\n\n(D) None of these: This option should be considered only after evaluating the other three.
