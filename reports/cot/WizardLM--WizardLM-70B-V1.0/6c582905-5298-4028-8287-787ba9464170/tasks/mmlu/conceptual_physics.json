This is known as gravitational lensing. However, it does not necessarily slow down the light, but rather bends its path.\n\nB) Light passing the Sun is deflected: This is correct. According to General Relativity, gravity can bend the path of light. This was famously tested during a solar eclipse, where the positions of stars in the sky were found to have shifted slightly due to the Sun's gravity.\n\nC) A clock on the Sun's surface runs faster than on Earth: This is also correct. General Relativity predicts that time passes slower in stronger gravitational fields, which is known as time dilation. Since the Sun's gravity is stronger than Earth's, a clock on the Sun's surface would indeed run slower than a clock on Earth.\n\nD) All of these: This option is correct because both A and B are predicted by General Relativity, even though A is not entirely accurate (light is bent, not slowed).\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer\nThe correct answer is (D) All of these, because both (B) and (C) are predicted by General Relativity, even though (A) is not entirely accurate.",

It works by using a coil of wire that rotates when an electric current passes through it. The amount of rotation is proportional to the current.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the options\nOption (A) current: A galvanometer can measure current because it is designed to rotate based on the amount of current passing through it.\nOption (B) voltage: A galvanometer cannot measure voltage because it is designed to measure current, not voltage. Voltage is the potential difference between two points in a circuit, while current is the flow of charge through a circuit.\nOption (C) Either of these: Since a galvanometer can measure current, this option is partially correct.\nOption (D) Neither of these: This option is incorrect because a galvanometer is specifically designed to measure current.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct answer\nThe correct answer is (A) current because a galvanometer is designed to measure electric current.",

However, the question is asking about a sonic boom, which is a different event.\n\n(B) Pulling out of a subsonic dive: A subsonic dive means the aircraft is flying slower than the speed of sound.

Both water and mercury are liquids, but mercury is denser and has a smaller volume for the same weight than water. This means that a column of mercury will be shorter than a column of water of the same weight.
