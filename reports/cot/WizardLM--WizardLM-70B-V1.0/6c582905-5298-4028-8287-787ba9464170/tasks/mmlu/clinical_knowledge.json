            "model_answer": "Step 1: Assess each attribute's relevance to marathon running\n\nA) Strength is important as a strong body is less prone to injuries and allows runners to maintain good posture and efficiency.\nB) Power, while relevant in sprinting, is not as critical in marathons due to the longer distances and slower paces.\nC) Stride length can contribute to speed, but it also puts additional stress on the joints, making it less favorable for marathons.\nD) Stamina is the ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort, and being able to maintain a steady pace over long distances is crucial in a marathon.\n\nStep 2: Compare and prioritize the importance of each attribute\n\nStrength (A) is important, but it can only help support the runner's ability to run for a long time without getting too tired. Power (B) is less important in marathons, because sprinting is less needed. Stride length (C) can be advantageous for speed, but it also puts additional stress on the joints, making it less favorable for long distances.

The question is asking us to identify the symptom that is not associated with anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction.\n\nStep 2: Break down the answer options. We have four options: stridor, bradycardia, severe wheeze, and rash.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option. We will go through each option one by one and determine if it is a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nStep 4: Option A - Stridor: This is a sound made by a person while breathing during an asthma attack, which can also occur in anaphylaxis as a result of severe respiratory distress. This is a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nStep 5: Option B - Bradycardia: This is a slow heart rate. It is not typically considered a symptom of anaphylaxis. In fact, anaphylaxis often causes an increase in heart rate due to the release of adrenaline.\n\nStep 6: Option C - Severe wheeze: This is a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing out and can occur in both asthma and anaphylaxis due to constricted airways. This is a symptom of anaphylaxis.\n\nStep 7: Option D - Rash: A rash is not typically considered a symptom of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis involves symptoms related to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, such as difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and loss of consciousness. Skin symptoms may occur, but they are not usually described as a rash in the context of anaphylaxis.\n\nStep 8: Identify the answer. Since the question asks for the option that is NOT a symptom of anaphylaxis, we can determine that Option B (bradycardia) is the correct answer.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(B)",

The patient's type of output determines the type of pouch used.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n(A) The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output.\nThis option is relevant because closed pouches are more suitable for containing semi-formed or liquid output without spillage.\n\n(B) The patient has a colostomy.\nA colostomy is a surgical procedure where the colon is diverted through an incision in the abdominal wall. The output can be solid, semi-solid, or liquid, but usually, an open pouching system is used for colostomy output.\n\n(C) In the immediate post-operative period.\nThis option does not specify the type of output, and it is not directly related to pouching systems.\n\n(D) The patient has a urostomy.\nA urostomy is a surgical procedure where the urinary system is diverted through an incision in the abdominal wall.

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "1. We are given information about an increasing number of sprints and four options regarding the progressive effects of these sprints. We need to determine which option is progressively increasing with the increasing number of sprints.\n2. Let's analyze each option individually:\n(A) Anaerobic metabolism, in the absence of enough oxygen, relies on glycolysis to produce energy, but it is limited in capacity. In contrast, aerobic metabolism, which occurs in the presence of oxygen and is more efficient and sustainable, can use glucose, fats, and proteins for energy. Sprinting, a high-intensity exercise, initially relies on anaerobic metabolism because it is quicker to use. However, the anaerobic contribution does not progressively increase with more sprints because it is not sustainable for long periods due to the production of lactic acid leading to fatigue.\n\n(B) The pH of muscle during exercise is maintained by the body's buffering systems and does not fall below 6.0 due to an increasing number of sprints. A significant decrease in pH can lead to a condition called acidosis, which can impact muscle function.\n\n(C) Blood glucose concentration during intense exercise like sprinting initially increases due to the release of glucose from storage in the liver and muscles. However, it does not consistently fall below 3 mmol/L with more sprints because the body is designed to maintain healthy glucose levels for energy needs.\n\n(D) Aerobic metabolism, which primarily uses oxygen, kicks in after anaerobic metabolism during exercise. The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases with an increasing number of sprints because the body needs a sustainable source of energy.\n3. Based on this analysis, we can determine that the correct answer is (D) The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases. As we perform more sprints, our body requires more sustainable sources of energy, so we gradually rely more on aerobic metabolism.\n4. The final answer: (D) The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism increases.",
