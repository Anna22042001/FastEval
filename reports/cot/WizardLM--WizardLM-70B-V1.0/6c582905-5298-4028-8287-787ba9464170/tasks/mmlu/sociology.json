This statement talks about a shift in power from capitalists to managers, but it does not directly address the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate statement (B)\nStatement (B) proposes that the affluent working class is adopting middle class values and ways of life. This statement aligns with the concept of embourgeoisement, which refers to the process of working-class individuals or groups becoming more middle-class in terms of values, attitudes, and lifestyles.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate statement (C)\nStatement (C) argues that white collar occupations are being 'deskilled' by the introduction of new technologies into the workplace. This statement discusses the impact of technology on occupations but does not directly address the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate statement (D)\nStatement (D) suggests that the class structure has fragmented and there are no longer any distinct social classes. This statement talks about the fragmentation of class structure but does not directly address the embourgeoisement thesis.\n\nStep 7: Determine the best answer\nBased on the analysis, statement (B) is the best fit for the embourgeoisement thesis as it directly addresses the process of working-class individuals or groups becoming more middle-class.\n\nStep 8: Output the answer\nThe answer is (B).",
