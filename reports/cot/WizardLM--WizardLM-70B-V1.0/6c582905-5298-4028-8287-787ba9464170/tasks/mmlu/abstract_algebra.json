            "model_answer": "Let's analyze the two statements separately:\n\nStatement 1: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian.\n\nTo evaluate the truth of this statement, we need to understand what a non-Abelian group and a factor group are. A group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group axioms are satisfied. If the group operation is not commutative, the group is non-Abelian.\n\nA factor group (also called a quotient group) is a way of constructing a new group from a given one, usually in terms of certain symmetry in the original group.\n\nGiven a group G and a normal subgroup N, the factor group G/N is defined as the set of left cosets of N in G, each represented by the product gN where g is an element from G. The operation on this is defined by (gN)(hN) = g(Nh)N = ghN, where g, h are elements of G, and Nh is the set of all elements of the form hn where n is an element of N.\n\nNow, if G is non-Abelian, we can't say for sure that G/N will be non-Abelian, because it depends on whether N and G/N are both Abelian. If they are, then G/N will be Abelian. If they are not, then G/N might be non-Abelian. For example, consider the dihedral group D4, which is non-Abelian. Take N as the normal subgroup of rotations, and G as the entire group. Then, G/N is isomorphic to the cyclic group C2, which is Abelian. Therefore, this statement is not always true and could be False.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nA normal subgroup is a subset of a group that leaves the group unchanged when combined with any other subgroup or element of the group.\n\nGiven that K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, there is no direct reason why K should be a normal subgroup of G. We could have a situation where K is not a normal subgroup of G. For example, consider G as the group of all 3x3 matrices with 1's on the diagonal and all other entries between -1 and 1, under matrix multiplication, H as the normal subgroup of G consisting of the diagonal matrices, and K as the normal subgroup of H consisting of the identity and the negative identity in the diagonal matrices. Here, K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, but K is not a normal subgroup of G. Therefore, this statement is not always true and could be False.\n\nNow, for the answer choices:\n\n(A) True, True: Both statements are not always true, so this answer is incorrect.\n(B) False, False: Both statements could potentially be false as we discussed, so this option is plausible.\n(C) True, False: The first statement could be false (as we've discussed), and the second statement is false as well, so this option is plausible.\n(D) False, True: Neither statement is always true, so this option is incorrect. \n\nThe only option that could be correct is (B) False, False, since both statements could potentially be false.

And, option (D) is saying that the first statement is false and the second is true.\n\n3. To determine the validity of each option, we need to examine the context given and see if the options align with the statements.\n\n4. For option (A), if both statements are true, then it means that in a group with an element of order 15, there must be at least 8 elements of order 15, and if there are more than 8 elements of the same order, there must be at least 16 of them. This is consistent with the given information, as having more than 8 elements of order 15 (which would include 16) would satisfy both statements.\n\n5. For option (B), if both statements are false, it implies that a group with an element of order 15 does not necessarily have at least 8 elements of the order 15, and a group with more than 8 elements of order 15 does not necessarily need to have 16 or more. However, there's no contradiction here as there isn't any guarantee that a group must have all its elements in the same order. So, this option is also potentially valid.\n\n6. For option (C), if the first statement is true but the second is false, it means that a group with an element of order 15 must have at least 8 elements of the order 15, but a group with more than 8 elements of order 15 doesn't necessarily need to have 16 or more. This option is also potentially valid as it's possible for a group to satisfy the first condition but not the second.\n\n7. For option (D), if the first statement is false and the second is true, it implies that there can be a group with an element of order 15 but it doesn't need to have at least 8 elements of the order 15, while a group with more than 8 elements of order 15 must have 16 or more.

To find the degree, we should find two elements that are roots of irreducible polynomials (see the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra).\n4.
