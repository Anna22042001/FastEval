            "question": "Suppose the angular separation of two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of your eyes. How will the stars appear to your eyes?\n\n(A) You will not be able to see these two stars at all.\n(B) You will see two distinct stars.\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.\n(D) The two stars will appear to be touching looking rather like a small dumbbell.",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking what happens when two stars are too close to each other in the sky for our eyes to distinguish them separately.\n\nStep 2: Consider the angular separation\nAngular separation is the apparent distance between two objects in the sky, measured in degrees. If the angular separation of the two stars is smaller than the angular resolution of our eyes, it means the stars are too close together in the sky for us to see them as separate points of light.\n\nStep 3: Consider the angular resolution of the eyes\nThe angular resolution of the human eye is the smallest angle between two objects that can be resolved as distinct. This is typically about 1 arc minute, or 0.017 degrees. If the angular separation of the two stars is less than this, they will appear as a single point of light.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the answer options\n(A) Incorrect - We will still be able to see something, just not two separate stars.\n(B) Incorrect - We cannot see the two stars as distinct because they are too close together.\n(C) Correct - The two stars will appear as a single point of light because they are too close together for our eyes to distinguish separately.\n(D) Incorrect - The two stars will not appear as a small dumbbell.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\n(C) The two stars will look like a single point of light.",

This disk was a cloud of gas and dust.\n\nStep 2: Over time, the materials in the disk started to separate due to differences in their density and the forces acting on them.\n\nStep 3: In the inner part of the disk, closer to the Sun, temperatures were higher. This made it difficult for materials like hydrogen and helium, which are light and typically found in gas form, to condense and form planets.\n\nStep 4: On the other hand, the outer parts of the disk were cooler. This allowed the light materials, like hydrogen and helium, to condense and form the outer planets.\n\nStep 5: In the inner part of the disk, only denser materials like metals and rocks were able to condense and form planets due to the high temperatures.\n\nStep 6: Additionally, the denser materials were heavier and, as a result, they sank to the center of the disk.\n\nStep 7: Eventually, the denser materials settled nearer to the Sun, while the lighter materials ended up in the outer part of the disk.\n\nStep 8: As the materials in the disk continued to clump together and grow, they eventually formed the planets we see today.\n\nStep 9: The inner planets, being made primarily of denser materials, are smaller and closer to the Sun, while the outer planets are larger and farther from the Sun.\n\nAnswer: (B) and (D)",
