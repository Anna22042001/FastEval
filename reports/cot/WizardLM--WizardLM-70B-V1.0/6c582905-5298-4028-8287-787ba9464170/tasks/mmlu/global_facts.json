We need to find the percentage that best represents this information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the answer choices\nWe have four answer choices: (A) 18%, (B) 38%, (C) 58%, and (D) 78%. Our goal is to determine which of these percentages is the most accurate representation of the given information.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices\nTo determine the most accurate answer, we can consider the general trends in internet usage worldwide. As of 2017, internet penetration rates were increasing globally, with some countries having higher rates than others. Brazil, being a large and developing country, likely had an internet penetration rate that was not as high as some developed countries, but higher than many developing countries.\n\nStep 4: Select the most appropriate answer choice\nConsidering the general trends and Brazil's specific context, we can eliminate (A) 18% as being too low and (D) 78% as being too high. This leaves us with (B) 38% and (C) 58%. While both are possible, (C) 58% seems more likely, given Brazil's growing internet usage and its status as a developing country.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\n(C) 58%",
