            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the question\nThe question is asking about optical isomerism in complexes containing achiral ligands. Optical isomerism refers to the ability of a molecule to rotate plane-polarized light in different directions, depending on the configuration of the molecule. Achiral ligands are those that do not rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each statement\nNow, let's analyze each statement to determine if it is true or false.\n\n(A) Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\nThis statement is false because even if all four ligands are identical, the square planar geometry allows for the possibility of optical isomerism due to the presence of a plane of symmetry.\n\n(B) Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\nThis statement is false because tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism if the ligands are not identical and the complex has a non-superimposable mirror image.\n\n(C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\nThis statement is true because linear complexes with different ligands lack a plane of symmetry, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light in different directions.\n\n(D) Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\nThis statement is false because even if all six ligands are identical, octahedral complexes can still display optical isomerism due to the presence of an improper rotation axis.\n\nStep 3: Identify the correct statement\nThe correct statement is (C) Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\nThe answer is (C).",

Since the number of protons determines the element (Manganese, in this case), we can ignore the number of neutrons for this question. The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, so the 55Mn nuclide has 28 electrons.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of energy levels\nThe number of energy levels in an atom is equal to the number of electrons, as each electron occupies a specific energy level. Therefore, the 55Mn nuclide will have 28 energy levels.\n\nStep 5: Match the answer with the options provided\nThe correct answer is (C) 8, which does not match the calculated number of energy levels (28). The other options are also incorrect: (A) 3, (B) 5, and (D) 4.\n\nStep 6: Reevaluate the question\nUpon reevaluating the question, it seems there might be a mistake in the provided options.
