However, it does not directly address the issue of non-compliance itself.\n\nD) Effect modification (interaction): Randomization can help control for effect modification by ensuring that the treatment and control groups are similar in terms of all relevant factors, thus making the groups comparable. However, it does not directly address the issue of effect modification itself.\n\nStep 4: Choose the best answer\nBased on the evaluation, the best answer is (A) Placebo effect, as randomization directly helps control for this factor by ensuring that the treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of all relevant factors.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\n(A) Placebo effect",
