            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "To answer this question, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. Estimate the number of people in the United States.\n2. Estimate the average amount of ice used per drink.\n3. Estimate the average temperature of the ice.\n4. Estimate the number of drinks with ice thrown away per day.\n5. Calculate the energy required to melt the ice.\n6. Calculate the total energy wasted per year.\n\nStep 1: Estimate the number of people in the United States.\nAs of 2021, the estimated population of the United States is approximately 331 million people.\n\nStep 2: Estimate the average amount of ice used per drink.\nLet's assume that, on average, people use about 100 grams (or 0.1 kg) of ice per drink.\n\nStep 3: Estimate the average temperature of the ice.\nTypically, ice is kept at a temperature of around 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F or 273.15 K).\n\nStep 4: Estimate the number of drinks with ice thrown away per day.\nLet's assume that, on average, each person throws away 2 drinks with ice per day.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the energy required to melt the ice.\nThe heat of fusion for ice is approximately 334 J/g. So, for 0.1 kg of ice, we have:\nEnergy = 0.1 kg * 334 J/g = 33.4 J\n\nStep 6: Calculate the total energy wasted per year.\nNow, we need to multiply the energy per drink by the number of drinks per day, the number of people, and the number of days in a year (assuming 365 days):\nTotal energy wasted per year = 33.4 J/drink * 2 drinks/day * 331 million people * 365 days \u2248 6.74 * 10^15 J\n\nNow, let's compare the calculated value to the given options:\n\n(A) 6*10^8 J: This value is too low.\n(B) 6*10^11 J: This value is also too low.\n(C) 6*10^14 J: This value is closer, but still too low.\n(D) 6*10^17 J: This value is much too high.\n\nBased on our calculations, the answer should be somewhere between options (C) and (D). However, since the question asks for the amount of energy wasted each year by throwing out the unused ice in their drinks, we need to consider that not all ice is thrown away. Let's assume that only 50% of the ice is thrown away. In this case, we need to multiply the total energy wasted per year by 0.5:\n\nTotal energy wasted per year (adjusted) = 6.74 * 10^15 J * 0.5 \u2248 3.37 * 10^15 J\n\nNow, let's convert this value to the correct answer format:\n\nAnswer: (C) 6*10^14 J",

While a dictionary might offer some guidance on \"who\" and \"whom,\" it may not delve deeply into the grammatical nuances between the two words.\n\n(B) A thesaurus: A thesaurus is a reference book or online tool that provides synonyms, antonyms, and related words. It won't help Anna with her grammar problem, as it focuses on word choice and not grammar rules.\n\n(C) A glossary: A glossary is a collection of definitions or explanations of terms, usually pertaining to a specific subject or field. In this context, a glossary might provide some guidance on \"who\" and \"whom,\" but it is unlikely to offer an in-depth explanation of their grammatical differences.\n\n(D) A grammar guide: A grammar guide is a reference material specifically designed to explain grammar rules, usage, and syntax. This would be the most suitable option for Anna, as it can provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences between \"who\" and \"whom,\" as well as other grammatical concepts.\n\nStep 4: Choose the best option\nBased on the evaluation of each option, the best reference material for Anna to use is (D) A grammar guide.\n\nAnswer: (D) A grammar guide",
