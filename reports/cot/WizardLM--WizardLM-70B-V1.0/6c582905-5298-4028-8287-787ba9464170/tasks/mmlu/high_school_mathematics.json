An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive members is a constant. In this case, we are looking for odd numbers, and the common difference should be 2 (since odd numbers are always 2 apart).\n\nStep 2: Identify the first term and common difference\nWe need to find a single odd number and a common difference of 2 that would result in a sum of 240 after a certain number of terms. Since 1 is the smallest odd number, we can start with it as the first term of our sequence.\n\nStep 3: Create the sequence\nNow, we can create a sequence by adding the common difference (2) to the previous term:\n1, 3, 5, ...\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of terms\nTo find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. The formula is:\n\nsum = n/2 \\* (first term + last term)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, first term is the first number in the sequence, and last term is the last number in the sequence. We are given that the sum is 240, so we can plug in the values:\n240 = n/2 \\* (1 + last term)\n\nStep 5: Solve for the number of terms\nWe need to find the last term of the sequence. To do this, we can first square both sides of the equation:\n\n(240)^2 = 2 \\* n/2 \\* (1 + last term)^2\n57600 = 2 \\* n \\* (1 + last term)^2\n28800 = n \\* (1 + last term)^2\n\nNow, we need to guess the number of terms. Since 28800 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, and 20, we can test these numbers to find the largest one that gives us an integer for the last term when added to 1.
