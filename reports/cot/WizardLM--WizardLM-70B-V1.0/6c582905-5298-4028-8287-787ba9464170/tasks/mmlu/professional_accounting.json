This means that the value of the inventory reported on the balance sheet is lower than it should be.\n\nStep 3: Explanation\nOn the liability side, the accounts payable is also understated because the credit purchase was not recorded. This means that the company's liability to pay its suppliers (accounts payable) is lower than it should be.\n\nStep 4: Answer\n(D) Understated Understated\n\nBecause both assets (inventory) and liabilities (accounts payable) are understated, the omission of reporting the purchase of merchandise has an impact on Arno's balance sheet at year-end.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Inspect inventory items that were ordered before the year end but arrived after the year end. (A)\nThis procedure is related to testing the existence and completeness of inventory, but it does not directly relate to subsequent events. Inventory items that arrived after the year end could be relevant for the next fiscal year, but not for the events subsequent to the audited period.\n\nStep 2: Test internal control activities that were previously reported to management as inadequate. (B)\nThis procedure could be relevant in the context of auditing the company, but it is not specific to subsequent events. Testing internal controls can help ensure that the financial data provided for the audit is reliable, but it does not help the auditor understand what happened after the audit period.\n\nStep 3: Review the client's cutoff bank statements for several months after the year end. (C)\nThis procedure directly involves reviewing events that occurred after the year end, specifically bank statements from several months after the audit period. This helps the auditor ensure that there are no outstanding transactions or liabilities that should be recognized or disclosed in the audited financial statements.\n\nStep 4: Compare the latest available interim financial statements with the statements being audited.

Comparing interim financial statements with the audited statements can help identify discrepancies, but it does not provide direct evidence of events or transactions that occurred after the audit period.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

The four options given are: A) Accounting Standards Updates, B) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases, C) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, and D) Staff Technical Bulletins.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option\nNow, each option needs to be examined to determine which one matches the process of making changes to the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nA) Accounting Standards Updates: These are used to communicate updates to accounting standards without revising existing literature. They provide updates after the literature has already been changed.\n\nB) Emerging Issues Task Force Releases: The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is a private sector committee that makes decisions about initiatives and issues that need to be addressed to improve the accounting standard-setting process. These releases address unforeseen circumstances not specifically dealt with in existing authoritative literature. However, they don't directly lead to changes in the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nC) Statements of Financial Accounting Standards: These were used by the FASB in the past to publish new or modified standards of financial accounting and reporting. But currently, they are not used for making changes. FASB has moved to a new system and no longer uses SFAS for issuing new standards.\n\nD) Staff Technical Bulletins: These are used to provide staff-level interpretations of existing FASB Statements, Interpretations, and their amendments. They don't change the Accounting Standards Codification.\n\nStep 3: Identify the correct answer\nFrom the above analysis, only option A) Accounting Standards Updates fits the description of what FASB uses to change the Accounting Standards Codification. \n\nSo, the answer is (A).",

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The Net Present Value (NPV) is a calculation that calculates the profitability of a projected investment by deducting the required expenditure from the expected revenue and comparing this to the initial investment costs.\n2. In this scenario, the initial investment costs $500 and the discount rate is given as 10%.\n3. To calculate the profits generated in year 5 and year 10, we need to discount the future value back to the present. This is done using the formula (Value / (1 + Interest rate)^Years). \n4. For the profit in year 5, the calculation would be (500 / (1 + 0.10)^5). This results in roughly $381.96.\n5. For the profit in year 10, the calculation would be (500 / (1 + 0.10)^10). This results in roughly $292.63.\n6. The Net Present Value (NPV) formula is (Initial investment + Discounted Value in Year 5 + Discounted Value in Year 10). This results in (500 + 381.96 + 292.63), or $1,074.59 (rounded to two decimal places).\n7. When we subtract the initial investment (500) from the total, we get $574.59.\n8. So, the project's NPV is $574.59.\n\nOutput the answer: (C) $3\n\nNote: The answer (C) $3 was not a correct answer as per the provided calculation. The correct answer should have been (D) $500, as the NPV was found to be $574.59, not -$3.",

The difference between the selling price and the face value is the premium.\n\nStep 2: Explanation of Amortization Methods\nTwo common methods of amortization are the straight-line method and the effective interest method. The straight-line method amortizes the premium evenly over the life of the bond, whereas the effective interest method amortizes the premium based on the unamortized balance.\n\nStep 3: Explanation of Amortization Error\nDean Co. incorrectly used the straight-line method to amortize the premium instead of the effective interest method. This would result in the premium being amortized evenly over the life of the bond, rather than being amortized based on the unamortized balance.\n\nStep 4: Effect of Amortization Error on Financial Statements\nThe error would affect the carrying amount of the bond, retained earnings, and the bond carrying amount in different ways.\n\nStep 5: Explanation of Alternatives\n(A) Overstated Understated: The bond carrying amount is overstated, and retained earnings are understated. This is because the straight-line method amortizes the premium evenly, rather than based on the unamortized balance.\n(B) Understated Overstated: The bond carrying amount is understated, and retained earnings are overstated. This is because the effective interest method amortizes the premium based on the unamortized balance, rather than evenly.\n(C) Overstated No effect: The bond carrying amount is overstated, but retained earnings are not affected.

We need to determine which option (A) $100, (B) $104.29, (C) $96.71, or (D) $97.33 is the correct price.\n\nStep 2: Identify the formula\nThe formula to calculate the price of a bond is:\nPrice = [Coupon * (1 - (1 + Yield / Coupon)^(-Term)) / (Yield - Coupon)]\n\nStep 3: Identify the given values\n- Coupon = 5% (0.05)\n- Yield = 6% (0.06)\n- Term = 3 years\n\nStep 4: Substitute the values into the formula\nPrice = [0.05 * (1 - (1 + 0.06 / 0.05)^(-3))] / (0.06 - 0.05)\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression inside the brackets\n= [0.05 * (1 - 1.114093455)] / 0.01\n= [0.05 * -0.114093455]\n= -0.005704675\n\nStep 6: Interpret the result\nSince the price cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of the result. Therefore, the price is approximately 0.0057. However, the given answer choices are all positive, so we need to consider the absolute value instead.\n\nStep 7: Compare the results with the answer choices\nThe closest answer choice to the calculated value (0.0057) is option (C) $96.71. However, this is not the correct answer choice because the calculation is not giving a significant enough difference between the yield and the coupon rate.\n\nStep 8: Rethink the given information\nWe need to revisit the given information to ensure that we have not made any mistakes. The bond has a face value of $100, a coupon rate of 5%, and a yield of 6%. We also know that the bond has a term of three years.\n\nStep 9: Reflect on the problem\nThe problem seems to be flawed because the yield is greater than the coupon rate, which typically results in a bond price less than the face value. The given answer choices do not reflect this, as they are all greater than the face value ($100).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option (C) $96.71 because it is the closest to the calculated price.
