The sentence is \"Everybody loves Raymond, or not.\" This implies that the sentence consists of two parts connected by 'or'.\n\n2. The first part is \"Everybody loves Raymond\". In the context of PL, we represent it as 'L' (Love). This is because in PL, we use uppercase letters (in this case, 'L') to symbolize propositions, and 'L' here stands for the proposition \"loves Raymond\".\n\n3. The second part of the sentence is \"or not\". In PL, 'or' is symbolized by the logical operator '\u2228' (disjunction). This operator indicates that at least one of the propositions must be true.\n\n4. The 'not' in the second part of the sentence negates the first part. In PL, 'not' is symbolized by the logical operator '~' (negation). So, '~L' would mean \"it is not the case that everybody loves Raymond\".\n\n5. Now, combining these, we have 'L \u2228 ~L'.
