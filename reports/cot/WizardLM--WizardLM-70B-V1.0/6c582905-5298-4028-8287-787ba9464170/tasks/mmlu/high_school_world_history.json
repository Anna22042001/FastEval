It emphasizes the importance of preserving peace, as it is more urgent than any other task. The speaker believes that without peace, independence holds little value, and the rehabilitation and upbuilding of countries will have little meaning. The revolutions may not be allowed to run their course.\n\nStep 2: Examine the options\nWe have four options to choose from:\n(A) The formation of the non-aligned movement\n(B) Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation\n(C) The Green Revolution in agriculture\n(D) Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology\n\nStep 3: Identify relevant keywords and concepts in the passage\nThe passage highlights the importance of peace, the role of reason, and the mobilization of spiritual, moral, and political strength in support of peace, particularly from Asia and Africa. The passage mentions the 1.4 billion people of these continents.\n\nStep 4: Match the relevant keywords and concepts from the passage to the options\nOption A focuses on the non-aligned movement, but the passage primarily discusses the importance of peace and its preservation. Option B is related to disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, but the passage does not delve into these specific topics. Option C refers to the Green Revolution in agriculture, which is not the focus of the passage. Option D is about the mobilization of pan-Asian ideology, which is somewhat related to the passage as it mentions the strength of Asia and Africa. However, it does not explicitly address the concept of pan-Asian ideology.\n\nStep 5: Select the best answer\nAmong the given options, the passage is most closely related to Option A, The formation of the non-aligned movement, as it discusses the importance of peace, reason, and the mobilization of strength from Asia and Africa - themes that align with the non-aligned movement.\n\nAnswer: (A) The formation of the non-aligned movement",

By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "The question asks about Sukarno's neutral stance during a significant conflict or event. We know that Sukarno, a leader from Indonesia, emphasized the importance of peace and the collective strength of Asia and Africa in his keynote address to the Bandung Conference in 1955. In this address, he encouraged the use of moral and political strength to uphold peace in the world.\n\nNow, we need to examine each option to determine which situation Sukarno attempted to maintain neutrality in.\n\n(A) The Arab-Israeli conflict: Sukarno might have addressed this event since it started in the mid-20th century, which aligns with when Sukarno was a prominent leader. However, it is not clear if he attempted to maintain a neutral stance in this conflict.\n\n(B) The Korean War: This conflict took place in the early 1950s, right around the time when Sukarno was becoming a prominent figure. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest that Sukarno was involved or took a stance in this conflict.\n\n(C) The Cold War: The Cold War was a global political conflict that lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Given that Sukarno was a leader during this timeframe and his focus on peace and unity in Asia and Africa, it is likely that he attempted to maintain neutrality during the Cold War. This aligns with his speech and would have allowed him to promote peace without aligning with a particular side.\n\n(D) The Vietnam conflicts: The Vietnam War took place from 1955 to 1975, during Sukarno's time as a leader. However, there is no clear indication that Sukarno actively took a neutral stance in these conflicts.\n\nBased on the reasoning presented above, the answer is:\n\n(C) the Cold War.",

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\n\n(A) was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\n(B) can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\n(C) should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\n(D) seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.",
