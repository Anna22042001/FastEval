            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the terms\nFirst, let's understand the terms used in the question:\n- Disjunctive syllogism: a type of syllogism (logical argument) that uses \"or\" to connect two parts.\n- Major premise: the part of a syllogism that connects the general rule to the specific case.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each answer option\nNow let's evaluate each answer option to see which one fits the definition of a major premise in a disjunctive syllogism.\n\n(A) Includes two or more alternatives\nThis option talks about having multiple alternatives, but it does not directly relate to the major premise.\n\n(B) Classifies subjects\nThis option talks about classifying subjects, but it does not directly relate to the major premise either.\n\n(C) Affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent\nThis option is about an important part of disjunctive syllogism, where either the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is affirmed, or the consequent (the \"then\" part) is denied. This seems to be the most relevant option.\n\n(D) Leads to a valid conclusion\nThis option talks about a valid conclusion, but it's not about the major premise specifically.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer\nBased on the analysis, option (C) seems to be the best fit as it's about an important part of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\nSo the final answer is (C) Affirms the antecedent or denies the consequent.",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Define the term \"style over substance\"\n\"Style over substance\" is a term used to describe a situation where a person or entity is more concerned with their appearance, presentation, or style rather than their actual content, quality, or substance. This is often seen as a negative trait, as it can lead to deception, manipulation, or misrepresentation.\n\nStep 2: Analyze each option\n\n(A) Changing the meaning of a word or phrase from one part of the argument to another: This option talks about altering the meaning of a word or phrase within an argument, which is not directly related to the concept of style over substance.\n\n(B) Confusing figurative language with literal language: This option refers to mistaking a figure of speech for a literal statement, but it doesn't essentially describe the concept of style over substance.\n\n(C) Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message: This option exactly describes the fallacy of style over substance, as it refers to the tendency to accept ideas solely based on their attractive presentation, rather than their actual content.\n\n(D) Using emotionally charged language to create an impression about the subject of a claim, without making an argument that the language fits the subject: This option is somewhat related to style over substance, as it is about using emotional language to create an impression rather than focusing on the facts, but it is not perfect.\n\nStep 3: Make the determination\nBased on the analysis of each option, (C) Reasoning that ideas presented in an appealing manner are correct, regardless of the content of the message is the best description of the fallacy of style over substance.\n\nAnswer: (C)",

This is a common negative tactic in arguments which is not conducive to productive discussion.\n\n(B) asserting an opposing arguer has taken an easily defeated position, which she has not really taken: This argument refers to misrepresenting or exaggerating someone's position to make it easier to argue against. This is also a form of negative behavior as it undermines the integrity of the argument and can confuse the issue.\n\n(C) causing confusion during an argument by a lack of ability to engage in refutation: This argument is about creating confusion in an argument by failing to engage properly with counterarguments. This is also problematic as open, clear and constructive arguments are necessary for effective discussions.\n\n(D) using threats of harm instead of reasoning to gain agreement: This argument refers to using threats of harm to convince someone to agree with you.
