Completeness, on the other hand, refers to the ability of a method to prove unsatisfiability for all unsatisfiable formulas.

It divides memory into units of equal size.\nThis statement is indeed a property of a purely segmented memory system. In a segmented memory system, memory is divided into segments which are units of equal size. Each segment has its own base address and length. This type of memory system provides a compact way of organizing memory.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\nThis statement is not necessarily a property of a segmented memory system. Virtual memory is a concept of efficiently using computer memory by temporarily transferring pages of data from RAM to a hard drive when the RAM becomes full.
