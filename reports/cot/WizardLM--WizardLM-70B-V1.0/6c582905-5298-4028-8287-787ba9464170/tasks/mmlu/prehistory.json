We need to find out which option A, B, C, or D is not usually found in early civilizations.\n\nStep 2: Compare each option individually with the statement\nA) trade: Trade is a common aspect of early civilizations, so it doesn't fit the statement.\nB) warfare: Warfare is known to be present in most early civilizations, but the statement says it's not in Minoan culture, so this option could be the answer.\nC) the development of a common religion: Most early civilizations have a common religion, so this doesn't match the statement.\nD) conspicuous consumption by elites: This is also common in early civilizations, so it doesn't align with the statement.\n\nStep 3: Choose the most logical option\nBased on the comparison above, option B) warfare seems the most fitting because it aligns with the information in the given statement.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\n(B) warfare",

While the Hopewell had a complex structure, they did not have a centralized formal government as per the statement provided.\n(B) monumental earthworks: These are large-scale human-made earthen or mud-brick structures, and the Hopewell is known for their monumental earthworks. They built mounds used for various purposes like burial and ceremonial activities.\n(C) urban centers: This refers to populated areas with high-density housing and infrastructure, and the Hopewell did not have large, complex urban centers. Instead, they had small, scattered settlements and were more focused on land use and agricultural practices.\n(D) a permanent military: This refers to a standing army or a regular military force. The Hopewell did not have a permanent military, as they relied more on seasonal or occasion-based warfare tactics rather than full-time military forces.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the answer choices against the question and eliminate the ones that do not make sense\nNow that we have gone through each option, we can eliminate the ones that do not apply to the Hopewell culture. The correct answer is the option that is not included in the elements the Hopewell lacked.\n\nStep 4: Choose the appropriate answer\nAfter analyzing the options and their relevance to the Hopewell culture, we can conclude that the element the Hopewell culture lacked is the development of large, complex urban centers.\n\nStep 5: Output the answer\n(C)",

However, it doesn't align with the fact that the question asks about the purpose of the markings, even if they were not a written language.\n\nOption C: This possibility is logical, as the markings could identify the source or group that produced the mud-bricks.

We need to evaluate each answer choice to determine the most accurate reason.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate Answer Choice (A)\nChoice (A) states that the brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk. However, this does not address the altricial condition of modern human babies, and it does not provide a clear explanation for the evolutionary solution.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Answer Choice (B)\nChoice (B) suggests that the secondarily altricial condition allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age. While this could potentially be a benefit, it does not directly address the altricial condition or its evolutionary implications.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate Answer Choice (C)\nChoice (C) asserts that it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis. This option is on the right track, as it connects the altricial condition with bipedalism and the impact on the birth canal. However, it still does not provide a specific explanation for the evolutionary solution.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate Answer Choice (D)\nChoice (D) maintains that it allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis. This answer choice directly connects the altricial condition to an advantageous adaptation for modern humans, specifically the ability for the brain to grow significantly before birth.\n\nStep 6: Determine the correct answer\nAfter evaluating each option, Choice (D) appears to be the most logical explanation for the secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies.\n\nFinal answer: (D)",
