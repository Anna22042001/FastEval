It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The four types of mutations mentioned in the question are:\n\nA) Deletion: A part of the gene is removed.\nB) Duplication: An extra copy of a part of the gene is present.\nC) Substitution: One base pair in the gene is replaced by another.\nD) Insertion: An extra part is added to the gene.\n\nStep 3: Recall the most common mutation\nThe most common mutation associated with cystic fibrosis is the deletion of three nucleotides (\u0394F508), which results in the production of a faulty CFTR protein.\n\nStep 4: Match the information\nThe deletion of three nucleotides (\u0394F508) is a type of deletion mutation.\n\nStep 5: Choose the correct answer\nThe correct answer is (A) a deletion.",

We are given four options: (A) only 5%, (B) less than 1%, (C) only 13%, and (D) less than 2%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the context of the question.\nThe question is in the context of GWAS, which are studies that involve scanning the entire genome to identify genetic variations associated with a particular trait or disease. In this case, the trait is BMI.\n\nStep 3: Consider the heritability aspect of the question.\nThe question mentions that despite evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies, known SNPs explain a certain percentage of the variation in BMI. This means that a significant portion of the variation in BMI can be attributed to genetic factors.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each answer option.\n(A) only 5%: Too low, as it does not account for the significant genetic influence on BMI.\n(B) less than 1%: Too low, as it does not account for the significant genetic influence on BMI.\n(C) only 13%: This option seems reasonable, as it suggests that known SNPs explain a moderate proportion of the variation in BMI, which is consistent with the idea that genetics plays a significant role in determining BMI.\n(D) less than 2%: Too low, as it does not account for the significant genetic influence on BMI.\n\nStep 5: Choose the most appropriate answer.\nBased on the evaluation of each answer option, the most appropriate answer is (C) only 13%.\n\nAnswer: (C) only 13%",

We need to find the correct percentage among the given options: 1%, 10%, 25%, and almost 100%.\n\nStep 2: Recall related information\nPKU is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which breaks down the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe). If left untreated, high levels of Phe can build up in the blood and brain, leading to intellectual disability and other serious health problems.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options\nOption A: 1% - This risk seems too low for an untreated genetic disorder.\nOption B: 10% - This risk is higher than the previous option but still seems too low.\nOption C: 25% - This risk is significantly higher than the previous options and is consistent with the risk associated with inheriting a genetic disorder.\nOption D: Almost 100% - This risk is extremely high and unlikely for a genetic disorder that is not always expressed.\n\nStep 4: Choose the most appropriate option\nBased on the analysis, Option C (25%) is the most appropriate answer, as it reflects the risk associated with inheriting a genetic disorder.\n\nAnswer: (C) 25%",

This makes options (A) and (C) unlikely, as they are related to high density lipoprotein (HDL) and LDL cholesterol itself, not the gene mutation causing the disorder.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate remaining options\nThis leaves options (B) and (D), which are HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor, respectively. HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, while LDL receptor is responsible for removing excess LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.\n\nStep 5: Determine which remaining option is more likely\nFamilial Hypercholesterolaemia is caused by a defect in the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the blood. This points towards the LDL receptor as the more likely candidate for the gene mutation.\n\nAnswer: (D) Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor",

So, this answer choice seems plausible.\n\n(B) higher proportion of genes that show linkage\nLinkage refers to the tendency of genes that are close together on the same chromosome to be inherited together during meiosis.
