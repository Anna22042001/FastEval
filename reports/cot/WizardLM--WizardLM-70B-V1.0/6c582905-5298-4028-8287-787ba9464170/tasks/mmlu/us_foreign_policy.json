            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question\nThe question asks why countries try to protect their own firms from exposure to the world market, despite international trade generally benefiting both countries.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the options\nNow, let's consider each option to determine which one best answers the question.\n\n(A) Irrationality on the part of the leadership - This option suggests that the reason countries protect their firms is due to irrational leadership. While this may be true in some cases, it doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation for why countries might protect their firms.\n\n(B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed - This option suggests that the costs of free trade are more noticeable and concentrated, while the benefits are spread out and less noticeable. This could be a reason why countries protect their firms, as the concentrated costs may be more politically sensitive.\n\n(C) Regime type - This option suggests that the type of political regime in a country determines whether it protects its firms. However, this doesn't directly address the question of why countries might protect their firms in the context of international trade.\n\n(D) International conflict prevents trade - This option suggests that international conflict is the reason countries protect their firms. While conflict can disrupt trade, it doesn't explain why countries would protect their firms in general.\n\nStep 3: Choose the best answer\nBased on the evaluation of the options, (B) Costs of free trade are concentrated, but benefits are dispersed seems to be the most relevant and comprehensive answer to the question.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

This could be a constraint as it limits the US's freedom to act unilaterally.\n\n(B) International law - International law sets rules and norms that countries should follow. If the US violates international law, it could face consequences, such as economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation. This could be a constraint as it limits the US's actions.\n\n(C) Intergovernmental organizations - Intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations, can influence US foreign policy decisions by providing a platform for other countries to voice their opinions and shape international norms.

            "correct_answer": 0,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question\nThe question asks why American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to world government. We need to consider each option and determine which one aligns best with the principles of American exceptionalism.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate option (A)\nOption (A) states that American exceptionalism's general anti-statism opposes centralized government. American exceptionalism often refers to the belief that the United States is inherently unique and exceptional among nations. This can include a skepticism towards centralized authority and a preference for individual freedom and limited government intervention. This aligns with the idea that American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to a world government, as it emphasizes a distrust of centralized power.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate option (B)\nOption (B) suggests that American exceptionalism views world government as impractical. While it is true that American exceptionalism might lead to skepticism about the feasibility of a world government, this option does not directly address the core principles of American exceptionalism. It does not fully explain why American exceptionalism would inherently oppose a world government.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate option (C)\nOption (C) proposes that American exceptionalism views the UN as a sufficient form of global governance. However, this option does not necessarily align with the principles of American exceptionalism, as it does not address the opposition to a world government. Instead, it suggests a more nuanced view of global governance, which may not be inherent to American exceptionalism.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate option (D)\nOption (D) states that none of the above options are correct. Based on the evaluations of options (A), (B), and (C), it is clear that option (A) provides the most compelling reason for why American exceptionalism might lead to opposition to a world government. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.\n\nStep 6: Determine the answer\nBased on the analysis of each option, the best answer is (A) Its general anti-statism opposes centralized government. This aligns with the principles of American exceptionalism, which often includes a skepticism towards centralized authority and a preference for individual freedom and limited government intervention.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
