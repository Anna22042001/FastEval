They are crucial for planning as managers need to envision the big picture and set long-term goals.\n(B) Analytical skills: These are the abilities to gather and interpret data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions. They are essential for planning as managers need to analyze data to make strategic decisions.\n(C) IT and computing skills: These are the abilities to use technology and software to manage and analyze data. While they may not be directly related to planning, they can significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of planning processes.\n(D) Communication skills: These are the abilities to effectively convey ideas, listen, and build relationships. They are crucial for planning as managers need to communicate goals, expectations, and feedback to team members.\n\nStep 4: Identify the skill that is not a key management skill in planning\nBased on the analysis, the skill that is not a key management skill in planning is (C) IT and computing skills.

Both of these cultures encourage collaboration and working together, but they differ in their focus and scope.\n\nStep 5: Choose the most appropriate option\nOut of the two remaining options, (B) Collaborative culture seems to be the best fit for workers' acceptance of change as a characteristic. In a collaborative culture, employees work together and support each other, which can lead to a more open-minded attitude towards change.\n\nStep 6: Output the answer\n(B) Collaborative culture",

These factors can be categorized into different layers.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each option\nNow, let's evaluate each option to determine which one is not a layer of cultural influence:\n\n(A) Social: This is indeed a layer of cultural influence, as social norms, values, and beliefs play a significant role in shaping an individual's behavior and attitudes.\n(B) Business: This is not a typical layer of cultural influence, as business practices and norms are generally influenced by the broader cultural context rather than being a primary source of cultural influence.\n(C) Organisational: This is also a layer of cultural influence, as the culture within an organization can significantly impact the behavior and attitudes of its employees.\n(D) Company: This is not a layer of cultural influence, as a company is a legal entity rather than a cultural construct. While a company may have its own culture, it is not a broader layer of cultural influence that shapes society as a whole.\n\nStep 5: Identify the answer\nBased on the evaluation, the option that is not a layer of cultural influence is (B) Business.\n\nStep 6: Output the answer\n(B)",
