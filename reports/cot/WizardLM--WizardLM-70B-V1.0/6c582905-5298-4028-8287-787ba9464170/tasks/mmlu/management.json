            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the given question\nThe question asks for the term that describes a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations between parties.\n\nStep 2: Process each option one by one\nWe need to understand each of the four options given to us. \n\n(A) Bargaining: This is the process of negotiation between parties to reach a mutually agreed-upon outcome. However, it doesn't necessarily imply the outcome is sub-optimal. \n\n(B) Satisficing: This term refers to the strategy of selecting the first option that meets a certain criteria. It's not directly related to negotiations. \n\n(C) Accepting: This could be a potential outcome of negotiations, but it doesn't necessarily mean the outcome is sub-optimal. \n\n(D) Compromising: This means agreeing to a conclusion where both parties involved are partially satisfied but also partially dissatisfied. This implies that neither party got everything they wanted, which aligns with the question. \n\nStep 3: Select the option that best answers the question\nAfter analyzing each of the four options, (D) Compromising stands out as the correct answer because it describes a situation where neither party is completely satisfied, which can be considered a sub-optimal but acceptable outcome of negotiations.\n\nAnswer: (D)",

This is not directly linked to decision making.\n(C) Over-confidence bias - This is a type of bias where a person tends to overestimate their knowledge or abilities, which can lead to poor decision-making.\n(D) Heuristics - These are mental shortcuts or rule-of-thumb strategies people use to make decisions.\n\nStep 3: Determine which answer choice aligns with the bias in decision making\nAmong the options, (D) Heuristics aligns with the concept of making decisions using rule-of-thumb strategies.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\n(D) Heuristics",

These reforms had a profound impact on the political and economic landscape of the USSR.\n\nC) Nelson Mandela: He played a pivotal role in ending apartheid in South Africa and promoting racial reconciliation, which had a transformational effect on the country.\n\nD) Bill Clinton: His presidency was characterized by economic growth, job creation, and improvements in technology and global relations. He had a significant impact on the U.S. and global political landscape.\n\nStep 3: In order to find the political leader who could not be termed a 'transformational' leader, we need to identify the person with the least amount of significant changes or transformations during their tenure.\n\nBased on the analysis above, all the leaders had significant impacts on their respective countries or regions. However, one could argue that Bill Clinton's presidency saw significant growth and improvements in various areas, but the changes might not be classified as \"transformational\" on the same scale as those brought about by the other leaders on this list (Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachov, and Nelson Mandela).\n\nAnswer: (D) Bill Clinton",
