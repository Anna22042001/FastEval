This gives us 400 and 95, respectively. Now, we can add these two numbers together to get our fraction: 400 + 95 = 495.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the fraction\nNow that we have our fraction (495), we need to simplify it to its simplest form. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator, which is 5. We then divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to get the simplified fraction: 495 \u00f7 5 = 99. So, our simplified fraction is 99/20.\n\nStep 4: Convert the fraction to a mixed number\nTo convert the fraction 99/20 to a mixed number, we divide the numerator (99) by the denominator (20) and express the result as a mixed number. This gives us 4 and a remainder of 19. So, our mixed number is 4 and 19/20.\n\nStep 5: Compare the answer with the given options\nNow, we compare our answer with the given options. Our answer (4 and 19/20) matches option (C) exactly.\n\nAnswer: (C) 4 and 1 over 20",

            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nThe problem is asking us to write 8 and 2 over 4 as an improper fraction in simplest form. This means we need to find a fraction that represents the same value as 8 and 2 over 4, but with the numerator and denominator in their simplest form (i.e., no common factors other than 1).\n\nStep 2: Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction\nTo do this, we multiply the whole number (8) by the denominator (4) and add the numerator (2). This gives us 8 * 4 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34. So, 8 and 2 over 4 is equal to 34 over 4.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the fraction\nNow we need to simplify the fraction 34 over 4. To do this, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. The GCD of 34 and 4 is 2.\n\nStep 4: Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD\nWe divide 34 by 2, which gives us 17, and 4 by 2, which gives us 2. So, the simplified fraction is 17 over 2.\n\nStep 5: Match the answer with the given options\nThe answer we found (17 over 2) matches option (A).\n\nAnswer: (A) 17 over 2",
