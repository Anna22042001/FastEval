            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question\nThe question asks which country is the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry.\n\nStep 2: Consider each country's natural resources and industry\nNow, let's look at each country's natural resources and industry.\n\n(A) United States: The U.S. is rich in natural resources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and various minerals. It has a strong and diverse industrial base, including technology, manufacturing, and agriculture.\n\n(B) Japan: Japan is known for its high-tech industry, but it lacks many natural resources. It has limited fossil fuel reserves and relies heavily on imports to support its industries.\n\n(C) France: France has some natural resources like coal, iron ore, and uranium, but it also relies on imports to support its industries, including nuclear power and agriculture.\n\n(D) United Kingdom: The UK has some North Sea oil and natural gas reserves, but it also relies on imports to support its industries, including manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nStep 3: Compare the countries\nComparing the countries, Japan and France have limited natural resources and rely heavily on imports. The U.S. and the UK have more natural resources but still rely on imports to some extent.\n\nStep 4: Determine the least self-sufficient country\nBased on the analysis, Japan seems to be the least self-sufficient in natural resources needed for modern industry, as it has limited resources and a high-tech industry that relies heavily on imports.\n\nAnswer: (B) Japan",

            "correct_answer": 3,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Analyze the question\nThe question asks about the process through which a new fashion design travels when it is introduced globally.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each option\nNow, let's evaluate each option to determine which one is the most appropriate:\n\n(A) Contagious diffusion: This type of diffusion refers to the spread of an idea or innovation from person to person within a community. While fashion designs can certainly spread through contagious diffusion, it may not be the most accurate option for a global introduction.\n\n(B) Relocation diffusion: This type of diffusion occurs when an idea or innovation spreads to a new location or community as a result of people moving. This option seems less relevant to the context of a global introduction of a fashion design.\n\n(C) Innovative diffusion: This term does not seem to be a recognized type of diffusion in the context of idea or innovation spread. It may be a made-up term or a combination of terms.\n\n(D) Hierarchical diffusion: This type of diffusion refers to the spread of an idea or innovation from a central source to other individuals or communities. Given that the fashion design is introduced globally, this option seems more appropriate than the others.\n\nStep 3: Choose the most suitable option\nBased on the evaluation of each option, (D) Hierarchical diffusion appears to be the most suitable choice.\n\nStep 4: Output the answer\n(D) Hierarchical diffusion",
