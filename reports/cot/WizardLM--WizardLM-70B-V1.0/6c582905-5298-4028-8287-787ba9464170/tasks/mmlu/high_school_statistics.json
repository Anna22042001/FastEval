            "question": "The weight of an aspirin tablet is 300 milligrams according to the bottle label. An FDA investigator weighs a simple random sample of seven tablets, obtains weights of 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303, and runs a hypothesis test of the manufacturer's claim.

            "correct_answer": 1,
            "model_answer": "Reasoning Step-by-step:\n\n1. The problem is asking for the P-value of a hypothesis test involving the weight of aspirin tablets.\n2. The null hypothesis (H0) is that the average weight of the tablets is 300 milligrams, and the alternative hypothesis (H1) is that it is not.\n3. We have a sample of 7 tablets with weights 299, 300, 305, 302, 299, 301, and 303. The sample mean is (299+300+305+302+299+301+303)/7 = 301.571 and the sample standard deviation is 4.497.\n4. Because our sample size is less than 30 and we don't know the population standard deviation, we use the sample standard deviation to calculate the t-score. The t-score is (sample mean - population mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size)). So, the t-score is (301.571 - 300) / (4.497 / sqrt(7)) = 1.545.\n5. The degrees of freedom for this test is the sample size minus 1, which is 7 - 1 = 6.\n6. Given that our t-score is 1.545 and our degrees of freedom is 6, we need to find the P-value associated with this t-score.\n\nStep-by-step conclusion:\nUsing a t-table or calculator, we find that the P-value associated with a t-score of 1.545 and 6 degrees of freedom is very close to 1 (0.983). Therefore, the answer is not A but C. We need to find the P-value associated with this t-score but with df = 7. Using a t-table or calculator, we find that the P-value associated with a t-score of 1.545 and 7 degrees of freedom is also close to 1 (0.986). Therefore, the answer is D: 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7.\n\nAnswer: (D) 2P(t > 1.54) with df = 7",

            "question": "The waiting times for a new roller coaster ride are normally distributed with a mean of 35 minutes and a standard deviation of 10 minutes. If there are 150,000 riders the first summer, which of the following is the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders?\n\n(A) 0 to 31.7 minutes\n(B) 31.7 to 39.3 minutes\n(C) 25.3 to 44.7 minutes\n(D) 25.3 to 35 minutes",
            "correct_answer": 2,
            "model_answer": "Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given that the waiting times for a roller coaster ride are normally distributed. The mean (average) waiting time is 35 minutes, and the standard deviation (which measures the dispersion or spread of the data) is 10 minutes. We have 150,000 riders in the first summer. We need to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the z-scores\nFirst, we need to calculate the z-scores for the lower and upper bounds of the time intervals. The z-score measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. We can calculate the z-scores using the formula:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\nX is the value,\n\u03bc is the mean, and\n\u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nStep 3: Find the percentiles\nNext, we need to find the percentiles corresponding to the z-scores. The percentile tells us the proportion of data that falls below a given value. We can find the percentiles using a standard normal distribution table (also known as a z-table) or a calculator with a normal distribution function.\n\nStep 4: Compare the percentiles\nNow, we need to compare the percentiles to find the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders. Since we have 150,000 riders in total, we can find the cumulative percentage for each interval and compare them to 100,000 (or 0.1 in decimal form). The shortest interval will correspond to the smallest value that is greater than or equal to 0.1.\n\nStep 5: Choose the answer\nBased on the calculations, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is (D) 25.3 to 35 minutes. Therefore, the answer is (D).",

A discrete random variable is defined as a random variable whosepossible values are countable. These values can be any numerical values, whether integers or fractions.\n\n2. (B) The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive: This statement is also true for discrete random variables. Mutually exclusive outcomes means that no two outcomes can occur simultaneously. In the case of a coin toss, for example, the outcomes 'heads' and 'tails' are mutually exclusive because they cannot both occur at the same time.\n\n3. (C) The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability: This is known as the definition of expected value. For any random variable, discrete or continuous, the expected value (or mean) can be calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability, then summing these products.\n\n4.

The rejection of a null hypothesis at a higher significance level (10%) does not necessarily mean it will be rejected at a lower significance level (5%). The rejection is data-dependent, not strictly related to the significance level.\n\n(B) Whether to use a one- or a two-sided test is typically decided after the data are gathered.\nExplanation: This statement is False.

The alpha level (1% in this case) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error). It is not the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis in general. The actual chance of rejecting the null hypothesis depends on whether it is true or false and the sample data.\n\n(D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\nExplanation: This statement is True. The power of a hypothesis test is defined as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (Type II correct decision). A high power means that a test is able to detect a true effect when present, and it is calculated under the assumption of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nAnswer: (D) The power of a test concerns its ability to detect an alternative hypothesis.\nFinal output: (D)",

Also, the Type II error depends on the actual effect size, which isn't changed by modifying the experiment.\n\n(B) The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.\n\nThis is incorrect because the power and Type I error are separate concepts. Power is the chance that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is false, while Type I error is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis.
