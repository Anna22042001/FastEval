Since Joe finished below Mya, Mya must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. This means Rob is in the 2nd position.\n\nStep 4: Determine the position of the remaining golfers.\nNow we know that Eve is 1st, Rob is 2nd, Mya is either 3rd or 4th, and Joe is either 3rd or 4th. Since Joe finished above Eli, Eli must be in the 4th or 5th position.\n\nStep 5: Determine the position of the remaining golfers.\nWe know that Mya is either 3rd or 4th, and since Joe is in the 2nd position, Mya must be in the 3rd position. This means Joe is in the 4th position.\n\nStep 6: Identify the second-to-last position.\nThe second-to-last position is the 4th position.\n\nStep 7: Match the answer options to the golfers.\nNow we can see that the correct answer is (D) Rob finished second-to-last, since Rob is in the 2nd position and the second-to-last position is the 4th position.\n\nSo, the answer is (D).",

Since Dan is not in the first position (Eve or Amy), Rob must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n\nStep 5: Determine Amy's position\nIf Eve is in the first position, then Amy must be in the last position. If Eve is in the third position, then Amy must be in the first position.\n\nStep 6: Determine Dan's position\nWe know that Eve finished above Dan. Since Eve is either in the first, second, or third position, Dan must be in either the fourth or fifth position.\n\nStep 7: Evaluate the options\nNow that we have the possible positions for each golfer, let's evaluate the options:\n\n(A) Rob finished last: Possibility, as Rob could be in the fifth position.\n(B) Amy finished last: Possibility, as Amy could be in the fifth position.\n(C) Joe finished last: Impossible, as Joe finished second.\n(D) Eve finished last: Impossible, as Eve finished first or third.\n(E) Dan finished last: Possibility, as Dan could be in the fifth position.\n\nStep 8: Choose the correct answer\nSince there are two possibilities for the golfers who finished last (Rob or Dan), we cannot determine a single correct answer based on the given information.
