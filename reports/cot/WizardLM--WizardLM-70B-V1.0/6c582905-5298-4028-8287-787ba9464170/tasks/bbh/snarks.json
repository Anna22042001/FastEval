However, being called \"terrible\" would generally be considered a negative trait.\n\nStep 5: Determine the purpose of sarcasm\nSarcasm is often used to convey a meaning that is the opposite of what is actually being said, typically to mock or criticize.\n\nStep 6: Apply sarcasm to the context of the statement\nStatement (B) is more likely to be sarcastic because it describes the person as \"terrible\" while they are doing something positive (promoting a charity stream). The use of sarcasm in this case might be to mock or criticize the person despite their positive action.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

However, it is often unhelpful and dismissive of the complexities of depression. This phrase could be used sarcastically, but it's not definitive proof.\n\nStatement (B) - Uses \"just be happy that you won't be depressed anymore,\" which is more specific and implies that depression is something that can be easily overcome by simply being happy. This statement seems more likely to be sarcastic, as it may be highlighting the oversimplification of depression.\n\nStep 3: Consider the context and tone of the statements.\n\nStatement (A) - Could be said with a neutral tone, potentially without any sarcasm. But it could also be used sarcastically, depending on the context and tone of the speaker.\n\nStatement (B) - Could be said in a mocking or condescending tone to highlight the absurdity of the idea that depression can be easily overcome by just being happy. The \"that you won't be depressed anymore\" clause adds a layer of insincerity, which could suggest sarcasm.\n\nStep 4: Conclude the analysis based on the examination of language, structure, context, and tone.\n\nBoth statements have the potential to be sarcastic, but statement (B) appears more likely due to its emphasis on the oversimplification of depression and the potentially insincere language. The \"that you won't be depressed anymore\" clause makes statement (B) seem more mocking than statement (A).\n\nAnswer: (B)",

The statement, without any context, seems to condone or support racism.\n\nStep 3: Compare the options, moving to option B.\nOption B: \"Just memeing about being racist, that's what keeps it toxic\"\nThis phrase implies that being racist in a meme or jokingly still perpetuates a toxic behavior or attitude. This statement suggests that even when done in a supposedly joking manner, racism can have negative effects.\n\nStep 4: Determine the context and the speaker's intent.\nWithout further context, both statements can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the speaker's intent. However, given the prevalent societal norms of considering racism a harmful behavior, it is more likely that the second statement is meant to be sarcastic.\n\nStep 5: Determine the sarcastic statement.\nThe second statement seems to be the more sarcastic one, due to its implication that perpetuating racism, even in a meme or joking context, is harmful and toxic.\n\nAnswer: (B)",

Determine sarcasm:\n\nSarcasm can be found in (B) as it contradicts the expected response regarding assault. \nAssault is a crime, and it generally contradicts the societal norm to let it slide without reporting or addressing it. \nHence, using \"You are right\" in this context is a stark contrast, indicating sarcasm.\n\n5.

Therefore, Statement A seems to have a higher likelihood of being sarcastic.\n\nStep 6: Fund the final answer\nConsidering the evaluation and comparison of the two options, the sarcastic statement is more likely to be (A) \"He didn't threaten, he only urged; totally different.\"\n\nOutput: (A)",

However, it could also be interpreted as sarcastic if the speaker is suggesting that using hardwood is ridiculous.\n\nStep 3: Analyze statement (B)\nStatement (B) says, \"Wow that's crazy, I've never had a takeout meal that used plastic containers before!\" Plastic is commonly used for food containers, so the speaker's surprise seems more likely to be sarcastic. They are implying that it is absurd to be surprised someone has had a meal with a typical, everyday material.\n\nStep 4: Compare both statements\nStatement (B) has a clearer implication of sarcasm, as its describes an everyday occurrence rather than something unusual, such as the hardwood containers in statement (A).\n\nAnswer:\n(B) is the sarcastic statement.",

The phrase \"it is much easier\" also seems dismissive and unhelpful.\n\nStatement (B): \"Have you tried not being rude? It is much easier.\"\nThis statement is addressing rudeness, which is generally considered to be a behavior that can be changed with effort and self-awareness. The phrase \"it is much easier\" seems to suggest that the person has the power to change their behavior if they so choose.\n\nStep 2: Compare the statements and identify sarcasm\nStatement (A) implies that being poor is a choice and disregards the systemic issues that contribute to poverty. The tone is dismissive and unhelpful, which may indicate sarcasm.\n\nStatement (B) acknowledges that rudeness is something an individual can control and change, and the phrase \"it is much easier\" seems to suggest that the person has the ability to improve their behavior.

Let's get rid of the trams and build carriages instead\"\n- On first glance, the statement appears to suggest replacing trams with carriages, which doesn't seem like a practical solution in a modern context. However, the use of the term \"yeah\" does not necessarily imply sarcasm. It could simply indicate agreement or acknowledgment of the idea being discussed.\n\nStatement (B): \"Yeah. Let's get rid of the trams and build lightrail instead\"\n- This statement also begins with \"yeah,\" which as mentioned before, might not necessarily imply sarcasm. However, the proposal to replace trams with light rail is a more feasible and modern solution compared to the suggestion of replacing trams with carriages in statement (A). This alone does not prove that the statement is sarcastic.\n\nComparing the two statements, statement (A) suggests a more outlandish and impractical solution, which could potentially indicate sarcasm. In contrast, statement (B) proposes a more practical, albeit not necessarily perfect, solution.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I would determine that:\nThe sarcastic statement is (A) \"Yeah.

It is often used to express contempt or ridicule.\n\nNow let's break down each statement:\n\n(A) Yeah, I've noticed he's been drinking every day recently, what a great transformation. \nIn this statement, the speaker mentions \"drinking every day.\" This is generally not associated with positive change or transformation, as drinking regularly can lead to health problems and other issues. However, the speaker says, \"what a great transformation,\" which implies that they are happy about this change. The contrast between the negative behavior (drinking) and the positive reaction (great transformation) suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic.\n\n(B) Yeah, I've noticed he's been exerercising every day recently, what a great transformation. \nHere, the speaker mentions \"exercising every day,\" which is generally associated with positive change or transformation. Regular exercise leads to improved health and wellbeing. The speaker then says, \"what a great transformation,\" which aligns with the positive aspect of the behavior mentioned. There is no clear contrast between the behavior and the speaker's reaction, so it does not appear to be sarcastic.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that (A) is more likely to be sarcastic due to the discrepancy between the negative behavior (drinking) and the positive reaction (great transformation).

While being over six feet might suggest that someone is tall, it doesn't logically lead to the conclusion that the person is wonderful.\n\nStep 2: Identify the sarcastic statement.\n\nA sarcastic statement is one that says something but means the opposite, usually with the intention of being humorous or mocking.

There is no clear indication of sarcasm in this statement, as it does not contradict what we would typically expect someone to say in this situation.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing Option B\nStatement: Sneaking out of a government facility with dangerous contraband isn't going to be illegal\nIn this statement, the speaker appears to be downplaying the severity of the action by suggesting it might not be illegal.

In other words, a sarcastic statement is intended to convey the opposite of its literal meaning.\n\nStep 3: Analyze option A\nOption A: \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight years ago.\"\nThis statement is not necessarily positive but it could be interpreted as sarcastic depending on the speaker's intentions. It could mean that things have actually become more expensive over the past eight years, but the speaker is expressing relief sarcastically.\n\nStep 4: Analyze option B\nOption B: \"Good thing things aren't more expensive now than they were eight days ago.\"\nThis statement is expressing that things are not worse than they were just eight days ago. However, it is still making a point of mentioning that things are not better. So, the negative context of insincerity makes it sarcastic in statement form.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion\nUpon analyzing the two statements, it seems that option B carries a more apparent sarcastic tone. It uses the word \"good\" to describe the condition, which is not particularly positive. It implies that things could be better, but they're not, and this is being presented as a \"good\" thing.

However, the dollar amount is significantly lower than the one in Statement (A).\n\nStep 3: Compare the two statements to detect the sarcastic one.\n\nUpon comparing the two statements, we see that Statement (A) is expressing sympathy for someone who received a large amount of money ($50,000). This is an unusual sentiment because typically, someone who earns money is considered to be in a fortunate position. On the other hand, Statement (B) expresses sympathy for someone who received a lesser amount of money ($50). Since the sentiment matches the situation (years of work), it is less likely to be sarcastic.\n\nStep 4: Determine the sarcastic statement based on the comparison.\n\nBased on the analysis of the two statements, Statement (A) is more likely to be sarcastic because it expresses sympathy for someone receiving a substantial amount of money, contrary to the typical sentiment associated with such an achievement.\n\nAnswer: (A)",
