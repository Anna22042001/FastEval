            "model_answer": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The given date is Tue, 7/9/1972. To find tomorrow's date, we need to add one day.\n2. There are different ways to add one day, but one common method is to use the integer division ( Modulus ) operator, which gives the remainder of the division. If the current date is 7/9/1972, adding 1 would result in 8, but remember that the month is between 1 and 12 (for non-leap years), so we have to ensure the month remains in that range. If it exceeds 12, we increment the year.\n3. For this, we can represent the date with numbers: the day is 9, the month is 7 minus 1 (since months are 0-indexed in most programming languages), and the year is 1972. So, the current date is (9, 6, 1972).\n4. To add one day, we can represent it as a vector: (1, 0, 0). The first element adds 1 to the day, the second element adds 0 to the month, and the third element adds 0 to the year. However, since the current month is July, we need to ensure that the next day Also, since the current year is not a leap year, we don't need to worry about February 29.\n5. Multiplying or adding the vectors, component-wise, results in: (9+1, 6, 1972) = (10, 6, 1972). However, since the day cannot be 10, we have to increment the month, which is now 7.\n6. The month is still within the range 1 to 12, so we don't have to increment the year.\n7. Therefore, the date of tomorrow is (7, 7, 1972).\n8. In the format MM/DD/YYYY, the answer is: 07/08/1972.\n\nAnswer: (B) 08/05/1972",
