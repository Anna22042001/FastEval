Since the deadline is June 1, 2021, and it's 2 days away from now, the current date is May 30, 2021.\n\nStep 2: Subtract 10 days from the current date\nNow that we have the current date, we can subtract 10 days to find the date 10 days ago.\n\nMay 30, 2021 - 10 days = May 20, 2021\n\nStep 3: Convert the date to the required format\nThe date we found is in the format YYYY-MM-DD. To match the required format (MM/DD/YYYY), we can simply rearrange the numbers.\n\nMay 20, 2021 becomes 05/20/2021\n\nStep 4: Identify the correct option\nNow that we have the date 10 days ago in the required format, we can compare it to the given options.
