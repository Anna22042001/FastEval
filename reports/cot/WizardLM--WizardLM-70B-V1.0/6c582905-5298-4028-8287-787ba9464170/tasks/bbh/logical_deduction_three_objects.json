The minivan is older than the tractor, and the minivan is the second-newest.\n\nStep 2: Understand the order of the vehicles\nSince the minivan is the second-newest, we can arrange the vehicles in ascending order of age, with the minivan in the middle. This gives us the order: motorcycle, minivan, tractor.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the options\nNow, let's evaluate each option to see which one is consistent with the given information:\n\n(A) The motorcycle is the newest - This option is incorrect because the motorcycle is the oldest vehicle in our order.\n(B) The minivan is the newest - This option is incorrect because the minivan is the second-newest, not the newest.\n(C) The tractor is the newest - This option is correct because the tractor is the youngest vehicle in our order.\n\nAnswer: (C) The tractor is the newest",
