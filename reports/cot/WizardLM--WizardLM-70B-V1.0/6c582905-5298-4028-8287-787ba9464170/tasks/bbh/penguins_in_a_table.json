Therefore, James is not the penguin we are looking for.\n\nStep 6: Review the given options.\nWe have five options to choose from: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, and James.\n\nStep 7: Rule out options based on the information provided in the table and step 4.\nFrom the table, we know that Louis is 50 cm tall, Bernard is 80 cm tall, Vincent is 60 cm tall, and Gwen is 70 cm tall. Since James was added to the table and is not the correct option, we have nothing left to consider.\n\nFinal Answer: (C) Vincent",
