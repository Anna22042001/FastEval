            "model_answer": "Step 1: We know that Susan woke up at 7am. This means she might have started her day at this time and is a possible starting point for when she could have gone to the coffee shop.\n\nStep 2: Linda saw Susan driving to the water park from 7am to 11am. It is unlikely Susan would stop at a coffee shop while heading to the water park, so this period might be considered as a potential time Susan spent away from the coffee shop.\n\nStep 3: Now we have some information about Susan's activity from 11am to 12pm (at the mall), 12pm to 1pm (taking photos near the Eiffel Tower), and 1pm to 2pm (buying lunch at the deli). During these times, Susan is occupied with different activities, so she probably didn't visit the coffee shop during these hours. This rules out options (C) and (D).\n\nStep 4: Thomas saw Susan reading at the library from 2pm to 6pm. This is another potential period where Susan was not likely to be at the coffee shop, but we still need to consider the remaining time range.\n\nStep 5: The coffee shop was closed after 9pm. This means Susan couldn't have gone to the coffee shop after 9pm.\n\nFinal Answer: We have one option left, which spans from 6pm to 9pm, before the coffee shop closes. So, (A) 6pm to 9pm",

So, she could not have gone to the soccer field during this time frame. This means we can eliminate option (A) 12pm to 1pm.\n\nStep 3:\nFrom 1pm to 2pm, John saw Emily walking towards the Statue of Liberty. This indicates that Emily was not at the soccer field during this time. Thus, option (D) 1pm to 2pm is also eliminated.\n\nStep 4:\nWe have to consider the time frame after 2pm because the soccer field closes after 8pm.

This means she could not have gone to the beach during this time because the beach is not open at 5 am. So, Option (D) 5am to 8am is not possible.\n\nStep 2: From 8 am to 9 am, Jessica was taking photos near the Eiffel Tower. This time slot falls within the time the beach is open (before 10 pm), but we are not sure about her whereabouts before and after this time. Therefore, we cannot conclude that she went to the beach during this time. So, Option (A) 8am to 9am is inconclusive.\n\nStep 3: From 12 pm to 3 pm, Jessica was fixing a computer at the electronic store. This is during the day when the beach would be open, but we have no information to confirm or deny the possibility that she went to the beach before or after her time at the electronic store. Thus, Option (B) 12pm to 3pm is also inconclusive.\n\nStep 4: From 3 pm to 7 pm, Jessica was seen watching a movie at the theater. This period rules out the possibility that she went to the beach during these hours. So, Option (C) 9am to 12pm becomes the only time period left that falls within the hours the beach is open (before 10 pm) and which we have no information about.\n\nStep 5: From 7 pm to 10 pm, Jessica was driving to the water park. The beach closes after 10 pm, so it was not possible for her to go to the beach during this time.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, considering the timings of Jessica's whereabouts throughout the day and the beach's open hours, we can infer that Jessica could have gone to the beach between 9 am and 12 pm, which is Option (C).\n\n(C) 9am to 12pm",
