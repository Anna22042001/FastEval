I used this website to perform the encoding: https://www.rot13.com/  \n\nYou can copy and paste the above text into the box on that website to verify that it encodes properly using the rot13 algorithm. Keep in mind that there are many different ways one could implement the rot13 cipher. Some versions use a simple substitution table which maps each letter to another (e.g., A->N, B->O, etc), while others may add a fixed offset to each character before substituting it. The specific method used by the website linked to above is not known to me, so it may produce slightly different results than other implementations.
