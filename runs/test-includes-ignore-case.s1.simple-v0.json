He returned later in flashback episodes, revealing that he had been found alive and well, though badly injured, by a fishing boat several miles downstream from where he fell. In real-life Derek Shepherd (actor) left the show due to disagreements over his character's storyline. This led to his unexpected and untimely demise in order for him to leave the series. Fans were devastated and it became known affectionately as 'The Day The Sun Went Out'. It is also considered one of the most emotive moments on television drama.\n\nActor Patrick Dempsey revealed the reason behind leaving Grey's Anatomy:\n\"I just couldn’t continue being part of something that I didn’t believe was telling the truth,\" said Dempsey. “And if we don’t tell the truth about these things, then we perpetuate them.\"\n\nHe also stated at the time, \"\"I wasn't happy. I need to be happy. It sounds so trite but you have to listen to your inner voice— otherwise you make decisions for all the wrong reasons. I have too much pride to do anything I'm not passionate about, especially now because this [show] means so much to me.
