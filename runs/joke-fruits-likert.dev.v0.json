If delivered well with appropriate inflection, it could potentially be humorous to some people. Therefore, I would rate it a 3.\n\nThe second joke by Brian Regan relies more on wordplay and exaggeration for humor. The concept of getting drunk and losing weight simultaneously is absurd but relatable, which might make it amusing to some people. However, the effectiveness of this type of humor also depends on personal taste and familiarity with similar types of jokes. So, I would rate it a 3 as well.\n\nTherefore, both lines receive an average rating of 3, making them somewhat funny or mildly amusing.

They woke up. ("}, "info": {"score": 2.0, "sampled": ["Sure! Here is how we can determine if the given jokes are funny:\n\nWe need to consider the context, audience, and content of the jokes. Let's start with the first joke:\n\nThe first joke mentions Apple Inc. twice and includes several puns related to the brand. Some people might find this type of humor amusing, while others might not. In general, puns can be hit-or-miss depending on personal preference. However, since the joke relies heavily on Apple-related puns, it may not appeal to everyone, especially those who are not familiar with the brand or do not have a positive attitude towards it. Therefore, we could give this joke a score of around 2 or 3.\n\nNext, let's look at the second joke:\n\nThe second joke is a play on words and depends on the listener's ability to recognize and appreciate wordplay. Again, wordplay can be subjective, and some people may find it clever and amusing, while others may not. We could rate this joke similarly to the first one, perhaps slightly lower because it relies solely on wordplay without any additional context or references. So, our rating for this joke would be around 2 or 3.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the third joke:\n\nThis joke plays on the idea of kidnapping, which can be considered dark humor. While some people may find it funny, others might feel uncomfortable or even offended. Moreover, the punchline does not rely on any specific cultural references or inside jokes, so it may be less relatable to certain audiences. Overall, this joke might receive a lower score than the previous two due to its potentially controversial nature. Our rating for this joke would likely be around 1 or 2."], "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is the following funny?\n\nWhy did the apple refuse to share its juice?
