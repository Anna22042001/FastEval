The fruit contains about two-thirds to three-quarters of its weight in water, which helps to ensure that it stays fresh and juicy all summer long.\n\nWatermelon's high water content also makes it an excellent crop for farmers. With irrigation available, watermelon can be grown in areas where other crops would not thrive, making it a reliable source of fresh produce year-round.\n\nWatermelon is also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C.
