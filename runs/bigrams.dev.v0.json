With the rise of digital transformation (DX), artificial intelligence (AI), internet-of-things (IoT) technologies and cybersecurity threats at an all time high, the pressure on business leaders within this sector has never been greater.\n\nOne major challenge facing tech companies today is ensuring they have enough skilled workers available to support their operations. As more and more jobs become automated through AI and IoT systems, there is a growing demand for professionals who are knowledgeable about these areas. However, many organisations struggle to find candidates with the right qualifications and experience. To overcome this issue, some businesses are investing in training programmes or partnering with universities and colleges to develop courses focused on emerging technologies. This not only helps them source new talent but also enables existing employees to upskill and remain relevant in a rapidly changing marketplace.\n\nAnother significant obstacle faced by tech firms is keeping up with the pace of innovation. DX initiatives such as cloud computing and data analytics have created opportunities for businesses to streamline processes, improve efficiency and cut costs. But for those who fail to adopt these solutions quickly enough, there is a risk of falling behind competitors and losing ground in the market. Additionally, as more companies embrace digitalisation, the level of competition increases; therefore, staying ahead of the game requires constant investment in research and development.\n\nCybercrime is yet another concern that continues to plague the technology industry. As more transactions move online and sensitive information is stored digitally, cybercriminals see increased opportunity for financial gain. Tech companies must ensure robust security measures are in place to protect against attacks – both physical and virtual.

This results in three occurrences of 'ng'. It appears as though I miscounted earlier, but there are still two instances of the trigram 'ing', which can only form from combinations of those bigrams (and nothing else). Therefore, my previous response was wrong, because it did not account for overlapping patterns. In any case, there are three 'ngs' in the sentence you provided. However, if we include trigraphs 'ing,' then that increases the total to six. If we further consider tetragraphs ('i-n-g'), then that would give us another four, making the total nine. Finally, pentagraphs ('i-n-g-e') yield yet another instance, resulting in ten in all. There may even be hexagaphic versions ('i-n-g-e-r), which could produce an eleventh occurrence! Nonetheless, regardless of whether one considers all possible ngrams or just bigrams, there were at least three cases where 'ng' occurred in your example sentence. That is, unless some other arrangement produces additional copies of 'ng' beyond what I have already found... but so far, I do not see how that might occur. Unfortunately, although I tried to provide more detailed analysis than before, I suspect that this explanation may still be somewhat confusing without context about why we care about ngram frequencies in the first place.
