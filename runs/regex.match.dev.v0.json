Captured groups themselves contain only one character and there is no need to call `.group(n)` on a `MatchObject`. If this does not help or you would like further information about how this works, let me know! Also if you want to test out some REGEX patterns yourself, I recommend using [regexr](https://regexr.com/) since it has many features built-in such as color coding.\nHere are examples of what each type of group returns when used in code.\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = r\"(\\d+)\"\ntest_str = \"1234567890\"\nmatches = re.finditer(pattern , test_str)\nprint([m.group(i) for m in matches]) # Output -> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10']\n\npattern = r\"\\d+\"\ntest_str = \"This is a number: 1234567890\"\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, test_str)\nprint(list(map(lambda x:x.group(), matches))) #Output-> [12345", "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "will regex pattern '(?P<1>a)' match the string ''? Either answer with 'Yes.' or 'No.'"}], "options": ["No."]}, "created_by": "", "created_at": "2023-05-10 14:02:10.426314+00:00"}
