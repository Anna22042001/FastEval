The seller of options expects the stock price to decrease before the expiration date so that they can buy back the options cheaper than what they sold it for (excluding transaction costs). The buyer of options expects the stock price to increase before the expiration date so that they can sell the options at a higher price than what they bought it for (again excluding transaction costs). However, this does not take into account any potential changes in volatility which could affect option prices as well. For maximum returns on both puts/calls, one should be indifferent between whether the stock price increases or decreases by the amount the premium paid for the options minus the intrinsic value of said options at expiry. This may result in different levels of indifference depending on factors such as time until expiration, current implied volatility, etc. Note: A straddle strategy involving being long a put and a call with the same strike and expiration will yield a profit if there is significant movement either up or down in the underlying asset but lose money otherwise; the break-even points can be calculated as the sum of the net credit received from writing the calls and put minus any transaction fees divided by two and then added to/subtracted from the strike price respectively. Thus, whether an \"increase\" or \"decrease\" is better depends on where you think the underlying security will move relative to these breakeven points. Similarly, a strangle strategy involving being long out of the money puts/calls on both sides will make a profit if there is significant movement in either direction away from the central strike price but loses money otherwise; again, whether an \"increase\" or \"decrease\" is better depends on how far away you expect the underlying security to move.

The goal of this strategy is to profit from a large move in either direction by selling the options back prior to their expiration. In your example, you have bought a put option (right to sell) with a lower strike price ($98), while simultaneously selling a put option (obligation to buy) with a higher strike price ($104). This is coupled with the purchase of a call option (right to buy) with a lower strike price ($104) and the sale of a call option (obligation to sell) with a higher strike price ($109). By doing so, you will make a profit if the stock moves significantly up or down by the expiration date, as you can then sell the more expensive option and keep the less expensive one.
