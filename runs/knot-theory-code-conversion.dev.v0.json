It's also important to note that while some simple conversions exist (for example changing every line segment going downward in a Gauss code to a line segment going upwards in a Dowker-Thistlethwaite code) these will not work on all such diagrams, and it is generally impossible to determine whether two given knot diagrams represent non-isomorphic knots without examining the entire diagram closely. As a result, even if such a direct conversion existed it would likely not be useful as any slight change could potentially produce a completely unrelated knot. A good resource for learning about various algorithms related to prime knot diagrams or other mathematical structures is Wolfram Mathworld at https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ . Additionally, I suggest exploring resources online which relate to knot theory, as many examples and explanations exist therein, particularly those pertaining specifically to knot diagrams like Alexander polynomials, Jones polynomial, etc. Finally, the University of Edinburgh has provided excellent lecture notes available here: http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~dewit/lecturenotesKT.pdf which include many topics relevant to your request.
