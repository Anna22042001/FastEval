This will help ensure we are discussing the concept you have in mind. In particular:\n  - Are you asking for an invariant of the knot itself, or rather some property of its diagram (like the minimum number of crossing changes needed to transform it into a standard unknot)? These could potentially differ for chiral vs. amphichiral knots, depending on exactly what definition is used.\n  - Do you require any particular algorithm for performing these crossing changes? For instance, are you allowed to use \"destabilization moves\" (i.e., introducing new intersections near existing ones), or must all changes only involve adjacent segments?\n  - By \"The unknotting number of the given knot is _\", do you intend that to be a statement about the value of the invariant itself, or rather a promise that I will output a single number representing the answer?

A crossing change involves changing one crossing into another or vice versa.\n\nOne method to compute the unknotting number uses the Jones polynomial. If V(K) denotes the Jones polynomial of a knot K evaluated at the variable V, then its unknotting number is defined by:\n```scss\nu(K) = min{n | (-V)^n * V^n * (V - (-V))^n * (1 + V)(1 +(-V))*V'(K) = 0}\n```\nwhere V' stands for the derivative of V with respect to a suitable parameter.

A Dowker-Thistlethwaite code consists of a sequence of numbers representing crossings along the length of the knot. It should not contain commas or other non-numeric characters.\n\nIn order to determine the unknotting number of a knot from its Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, you can use an algorithm such as the one described by Hoste and Thistlethwaite (1997). This involves labeling each crossing in the knot with a binary value depending on whether it increases or decreases the writhe of the knot. By counting the number of positive crossings in the knot, we can obtain the unknotting number. In general, if a knot has a unknotting number n, then any smoothing of the knot that results in a positive number of negative crossings will result in an n-component unlink.\n\nFor example, let us consider the trefoil knot, which has the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code \"3, -3, 5\". We can apply the above algorithm to this code by labelling each crossing with either a \"+\", \"-\" or \".\" according to whether it increases, decreases, or leaves unchanged the writhe of the knot.

In other words, it is the smallest possible value of the minimal crossings of a representative diagram for a particular knot type. As such, the U-number can be used to determine whether two knots are equivalent or not by checking if their U-numbers match. Knot diagrams with fewer than U crossings cannot always be transformed into the unknot, and thus do not represent distinct knot types. However, there exist examples where two different knot diagrams share the same set of less than U crossings. These instances are known as 'stable equivalences.' Thus, while the U-number is a useful tool for classifying knots, it does not necessarily capture all information about them. For example, many prime knots have been shown to possess multiple stable equivalence classes sharing a common set of fewer than U crossings. Conversely, some composite knots have only one such class associated with them. Additionally, two composite knots may have nonisomorphic Jones polynomial sequences despite having identical sets of fewer than U crossings. Hence, the study of knot theory is ongoing, and new discoveries continue to reveal fascinating aspects of these mathematical objects.

Since 26 is the smallest multiple of 3 that equals or exceeds 98, the unknotting number is indeed 26.\n\nThe unknotting number is important because it tells us how many times we need to perform an operation called the \"unknotting move\" on the knot before it becomes trivially untied (i.e., equivalent to the unknot). Each time you apply the unknotting move, you remove three crossings from the diagram, which means that after n applications, there will be at most 3n crossings remaining. Thus, if a knot has unknotting number N, then it must have at least N*3 crossings in its minimal diagram. If a knot has fewer than N*3 crossings, then it cannot have unknotting number greater than N. This fact provides a useful bound for determining whether a given knot is prime (i.e., not equivalent to the product of two non-trivial knots) or composite (equivalent to the connected sum of two non-trivial knots), since any composite knot with less than N*3 crossings would necessarily factor into two non-trivial knots with more than N/2 crossings each.

However, they can still become untied if we allow more general moves, such as the birth move or death move. For example, the knot $9_{35}$ has unknotting number $-6$ but it can be untied using both the birth move and the Conway mutation (also known as the \"inked handle\" operation) (see [Knot Theory Software (KnotS): An open source software package for computing and visualizing mathematical knots and links](http://www.math.toronto.edu/%7Ejozsef/knots/)).

For example, if I were to tie a simple overhand knot with two pieces of ribbon, and then pull on one end so that it completely unties itself without any other movement or assistance from my hands (i.e., gravity doesn't count), then the length needed for an unknotting would be three units; this is because two units make up each loop, plus an additional unit to account for the tail that extends beyond the loops. However, some knots are more complex than others, such as those listed above. These knots have higher unknotting numbers due to their increased complexity; they require longer lengths of material to tie themselves securely enough that they cannot be undone by simply pulling on one piece of the ribbon like before.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code represents the unknotting number of a knot because its binary sequence describes how many crossings there are along different paths on the surface of the knot (up to eight). When you convert these values into binary using binary conversion methods (e.g., long division) and concatenate them together, you get a single string of digits representing all of the crossings across every path. By extension, this means that the length of the resulting Dowker-Thistlethwaite code corresponds directly to the unknotting number of the knot.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that while the Dowker-Thistlethwaite code provides us with information about the unknotting number of a particular knot, it does not tell us anything else about the actual structure or properties of that knot.

In order to determine an unknotting number for a knot, all crossings must have either one or zero uncrossing operations applied to them, but there are no such uncrossing sequences that will result in this knot being equivalent to the unknot (i.e., having a DT code of all zeros). Therefore, we cannot assign it any unknotting number value. However, this does NOT mean that it is necessarily a non-trivial knot--it may just be impossible to represent as a collection of simple tangles with only two strands per tangle. There are many knots which do not admit a Conway notation or a Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, including some that have been proven mathematically to be topologically non-trivial. To definitively prove whether or not a knot is trivial or non-trivial requires more advanced mathematical tools than those used by KnotPlot3D. A knot that can't be assigned an unknotting number using these methods could very well still turn out to be a valid, meaningfully different from the unknot, mathematical object once other techniques are brought into play to study it.\n\nIn summary, \"The unknotting number of the given knot is undefined due to containing both positive and negative crossing information; further investigation beyond mere counting of crossings would be necessary to classify this knot.\" Would you like me to attempt to represent your knot in another notation system?

Its unknotting number is 3 since it takes three negative crossings to untie it.

In general, finding the minimal crossing number (i.e., untieing the knot) of an arbitrary link is known to be computationally difficult; there exist algorithms which do so exactly but their running time is exponential in the number of crossings. However, for small examples such as those with at most 10 crossings, one may be able to determine the result by hand or with simple computational methods. For instance, using basic knot theory techniques one could check that the figure eight knot has unknotting number 2 (since it bounds a disk on one side, and the other side contains a nontrivial loop). Similarly, for the trefoil knot, one checks either directly or via Alexander polynomial computations that it does not bound a Mobius band. Hence, it cannot be untied, i.e., $\\nu = \\infty$.
