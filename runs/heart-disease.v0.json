This includes walking, jogging, swimming, bicycling, weight training, yoga, Pilates, etc.\n* Balancing calorie intake with physical activity helps maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI). A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered ideal; higher numbers indicate overweight or obese status while lower numbers suggest underweight.

It's important to consult with your doctor regarding your individual risk factors and potential treatment options for preventing or managing heart disease. They can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances and medical history. This includes identifying other possible causes for your symptoms, such as non-cardiac conditions, conducting additional tests or evaluations, and recommending lifestyle changes, medication, surgery, or other interventions when appropriate. So while this tool may be useful in helping identify individuals at higher risk, it should always be combined with proper clinical evaluation by trained professionals. Therefore, you should schedule an appointment with your health care provider for further assessment and advice about how to protect yourself against cardiovascular problems. Remember, proactive steps like maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, controlling stress levels, managing weight and other modifiable risks can make a big difference over time. By taking these precautions early on, you could potentially lower your odds of developing serious complications down the road. Your primary care physician or cardiologist would be best equipped to help guide you through this process.
